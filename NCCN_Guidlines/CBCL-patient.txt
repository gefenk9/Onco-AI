About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas, Version 2.2024 –
May 6, 2024.

Lymphoma is the most common type of blood
cancer. It affects the lymphatic system. The

of the body’s immune system. It is a germfighting network of tissues and organs that
includes the bone marrow, spleen, thymus,
lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels.

1 CBCL basics » Lymphocytes » Primary cutaneous lymphomas

Primary cutaneous
lymphomas

As lymph travels throughout your body, it
passes through hundreds of small beanshaped structures called lymph nodes. Lymph
nodes make immune cells that help the body
fight infection. They also filter the lymph fluid
and remove foreign material such as bacteria
and cancer cells.

Primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCL) or
lymphomas of the skin are a rare group
of NHLs. PCL is not a type of skin cancer.
Skin cancer develops from skin cells. PCL
develops from abnormal B or T lymphocytes. A
lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell.

Lymphocytes

There are 2 types of PCL:

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer
of lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type of
white blood cell that helps fight and prevent
infection. Lymphocytes are found in blood
and lymph tissue, and every organ in the
body. Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels
and lymph nodes. Lymphocytes normally
grow in response to infection or inflammation.
When they grow on their own without proper
regulation, they can develop into lymphoma.

Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL)

Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) develops
from abnormal B cells. B cells produce
antibodies that are used to attack invading
bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The antibody
molecules latch onto and destroy invading
viruses or bacteria.

There are 3 main types of lymphocytes:



B lymphocytes or B cells make
antibodies. An antibody is a protein that
fights infection.

CBCL often appears as nodules under the
skin that might look like small pimples called
papules.

T lymphocytes or T cells help kill
tumor cells and help control immune
responses.

Main types include:


Natural killer (NK) cells have
granules (small particles) with enzymes
that can kill tumor cells or cells infected
with a virus.

Results from blood and tissue tests, imaging
studies, and biopsy will determine your
treatment plan. It is important you understand
what these tests mean. Ask questions about
your test results. Online patient portals are one
way to access your test results. Please wait to
discuss the results with your doctor or health
care team.

Guide 1.

It's beneficial to have a support system
in place during diagnosis and treatment.
Enlist the help of friends, family members,
or peers who can provide transportation,
meals, and emotional support. These can
be different people for different tasks or
change over time.
Consider bringing someone with you to
doctor visits if possible, or have someone
on the phone or join you for telehealth
visits.
Don’t hesitate to ask questions and take
notes during appointments. Write down
questions and ask a friend or family

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

Set up a patient portal or health record
account if it’s available, which can
help you track your appointments and
communicate with your care team. In
many places the MyChart or portal
messages are not immediately seen by
a nurse or physician, so ask your care
team how best to communicate with them,
especially in an emergency.

For possible tests and procedures, see

Keep these things in mind:


Organize your medical documents,
including insurance forms, medical
records, and test results. Keep a list of
contact information for your care team
and update your primary care physician
(PCP) regarding any changes. Include
details about the specific type of cancer,
treatment, and dates in your contact list.

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Skin exam

or warm to the touch? Are there bumps or a
raised, smooth area? Is there an odor? Share
any photos.

A dermatologist is an expert in the skin and
diseases of the skin. It is important to find an
dermatologist experienced in lymphomas of the
skin to conduct a skin exam. Cutaneous B-cell
lymphoma (CBCL) might appear as a rash,
lumps, bumps, or tumor. A rash is an area of
irritated or swollen skin. Many rashes are itchy,
red, and painful. As a rash, CBCL might come
and go. This doesn’t mean the cancer is cured.

Skin lesions
Skin is the largest organ in your body. A skin
lesion is a change in color or texture in an area
of the skin. Skin lesions can appear anywhere
on the body, but are most common on the lower
abdomen, upper thighs, buttocks, and breasts.
Some words to describe skin lesions include
patch, papule, plaque, nodule, or tumor.

The amount of cancer is measured using
the size of your hand. One hand is equal to
1 percent (1%) of your total body surface
area (BSA). In addition, any tumors will be
measured by their depth, height, size, and
region of the body. Keeping a photo journal
might help track your skin changes over time.

Patch
A patch is a flat, thin, pink or red lesion of any
size that forms on the skin. Patches may be
dry, scaly, itchy, and may look like eczema or
psoriasis. They can be lighter or darker than
surrounding skin. The patches may sometimes
become plaques (raised or hardened lesions)
on the skin.

You know your skin better than anyone. Tell
your doctor about your normal skin color. Show
the differences in where the skin looks normal
and different to you. Describe any changes.
Does the area itch or burn? Is it dry? Is it red

Skin lesions
A papule is a very small,
solid bump. A plaque is a
raised or hardened lesion
that forms on the skin, larger
than a papule. Plaques
sometimes become tumors
on the skin.

2 Testing for CBCL » Fertility (all genders)

Fertility (all genders)

Papule
A papule is a very small, solid lump that might
look like a very small pimple. Usually, papules
are found in groups. Papules may be red,
purple, brown, or pink.

Some types of treatment can affect your
fertility, the ability to have children. If you think
you want children in the future, ask your care
team how cancer and cancer treatment might
change your fertility. To preserve your fertility,
you may need to take action before starting
cancer treatment. Those who want to have
children in the future should be referred to a
fertility specialist to discuss the options before
starting treatment.

Plaque
A plaque is a raised (elevated) or hardened
(indurated) lesion of any size that forms on the
skin. Plaques may be red, scaly, and itchy, and
may look like eczema or psoriasis. Plaques
sometimes become tumors on the skin.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t sure at the
moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists
can help you sort through what may be best for
your situation.

Papulonodular
Papulonodular is a combination of papules and
nodules found on the skin. Nodules are raised
higher on the skin than papules.

Ulcer

More information on fertility
preservation in adolescents
and young adults is
available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for
Cancer app.

A skin ulcer is an open sore or wound on the
skin.

Changes in fertility

Tumor
A tumor is a firm, dome-shaped mass at least
1 centimeter in size.

Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

2 Testing for CBCL » Blood tests

Blood tests

HIV
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
An HIV antibody test checks for HIV antibodies
in a sample of blood, urine, or saliva. It’s
important to let your doctor know if you have
ever been infected with HIV.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and how
well organs are working. They require a sample
of your blood, which is removed through a
needle placed into a vein in your arm.

Complete blood count and
differential

HTLV

A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your
blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a picture
of your overall health. A differential counts the
number of each type of WBC (neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and
basophils). It also checks if the counts are in
balance with each other.

Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) testing is
used to detect an HTLV infection that could be
the cause of a T-cell lymphoma. In the United
States, all donated blood is screened for HTLV.

Lactate dehydrogenase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is a protein found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into the blood.
Fast-growing cells also release LDH and
cause levels of this protein to be elevated in
the blood.

Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures substances in your blood. A CMP
provides important information about how well
your kidneys and liver are working, among
other things.

Pregnancy test
If planned treatment might affect pregnancy,
then those who can become pregnant will
be given a pregnancy test before treatment
begins.

Hepatitis B and hepatitis C
Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are types of liver
disease caused by a virus. A hepatitis blood
test will show if you had hepatitis in the past or
if you have it today. Some cancer treatments
can wake up (or reactivate) the virus. If this
happens, it can cause harm to the liver.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

SPEP
Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)
examines specific proteins in the blood called
globulins, which may be increased in certain
conditions such as multiple myeloma.

13

2 Testing for CBCL » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

MRI scan

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body to look for cancer deposits. A
radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report
to your doctor. While these reports might be
available to you through your patient portal or
patient access system, please wait to discuss
these results with your care team.

An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It does not
use x-rays. Because of the very strong magnets
used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist
if you have any metal in your body. During the
test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath
for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects
the images. Contrast is often used.

Contrast material

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are substances that help enhance
and improve the images of several organs and
structures in the body. It is used to make the
pictures clearer. The contrast is not permanent
and will leave your body in your urine
immediately after the test. The types of contrast
vary and are different for CT and MRI.

PET scan
A PET (positron emission tomography) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans. However, not all tumors will
appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright
spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain,
heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on
PET. Inflammation or infection can also show
up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

CT scan
A CT or CAT (computed tomography) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your head,
neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis may be one
of the tests to look for cancer. In most cases,
contrast will be used.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

X-ray
An x-ray is a type of radiation. In small doses,
it is used to make pictures of the inside of the
body. It might be referred to as a radiograph.

14

2 Testing for CBCL » Biopsy

Biopsy

Lymph node biopsy
Lymph nodes are usually too small to be
seen or felt. Sometimes, lymph nodes can
feel swollen, enlarged, hard to the touch, or
don’t move when pushed (fixed or immobile).
A lymph node biopsy can be done using a
needle biopsy procedure or as a small surgery
to remove (excise) a lymph node.

A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue
such as skin, lymph node, and/or bone
marrow. It is an important part of an accurate
diagnosis of lymphoma. Your sample should
be reviewed by a pathologist who is an expert
in the diagnosis of CBCL. The pathologist
will note the overall appearance and the size,
shape, and type of your cells. This review is
often referred to as histology, histopathology,
or hematopathology review. Tests will be done
on the biopsied cells. Ask questions about your
biopsy results and what they mean for your
treatment.

Bone marrow tests
Bone marrow tests might be done in certain
cases.
There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that
are often done at the same time:

Skin lesion biopsy
A sample of your lesion will be removed and
tested to confirm the type of CBCL. A skin
lesion biopsy can be incisional or excisional.
An incisional biopsy removes an area of
skin using a scalpel blade. Stitches are
usually required after an incisional biopsy. An
excisional biopsy removes a larger area of
skin, tumor, or lesion.

Bone marrow aspirate



Bone marrow biopsy

Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding
liquid and cells. An aspirate takes some of the
liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy
takes a piece of the sponge.
For many, this is an uncomfortable procedure.
Your care team will try to make you as
comfortable as possible. The samples are
usually taken from the back of the hip bone
(pelvis). You will likely lie on your belly or side.
For an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed
through your skin and into the bone. Liquid
bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe.
For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to
remove a small piece of the bone. You may
feel bone pain in your hip for a few days. Your
skin may bruise.

Skin punch biopsy
In a skin punch biopsy, a small sample of skin
and connective tissue are removed using a
hand-held tool. Stitches are often used to close
the opening in the skin.

Skin shave biopsy
A skin shave biopsy removes the top layer
of skin using a tool like a razor. This type of
biopsy may not be recommended because it
doesn’t take a deep enough sample. Abnormal
lymphocytes are often found under the surface
of the skin.

2 Testing for CBCL » Immunophenotyping

Immunophenotyping
Immunophenotyping is a process that uses
antibodies to detect the presence or absence
of certain antigens. Antigens are proteins or
markers that can be found on the surface of
or inside all cells, including white blood cells.
Specific groupings of antigens are normal.
However, some specific patterns of antigens
called the immunophenotype are found
on abnormal cells including non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) and CBCL.

Testing takes time. It might
take days or weeks for all test
results to come in.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunophenotyping can be done using
specialized techniques called flow cytometry
or immunohistochemistry (IHC). These
techniques are used to distinguish CBCL from
other types of lymphoma. Immunophenotype
can change as cancer progresses.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to immune cells. The cells are
then studied using a microscope. IHC looks
for the immunophenotype of cells from a skin
biopsy. IHC panel of skin biopsy can include
testing for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD10, CD20,
CD30, CD56, ALK, BCL2, BCL6, IRF4/MUM1,
and others.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry (FCM) is a laboratory method
used to detect, identify, and count specific
cells. Flow cytometry involves adding a lightsensitive dye to cells. The dyed cells are
passed through a beam of light in a machine.
The machine measures the number of
cells, things like the size and shape of the
cells, and other unique features of the cells.
Flow cytometry may be used on cells from
circulating (peripheral) blood, bone marrow,
or a biopsy. The most common use of flow
cytometry is in the identification of markers on
cells, particularly in the immune system (called
immunophenotyping).

2 Testing for CBCL » Testing for CBCL biomarker and genetic changes

Testing for CBCL biomarker
and genetic changes
Biomarker and genetic tests are used to
learn more about your type of CBCL, to guide
treatment, and to determine the likely path
your cancer will take (prognosis). This genetic
testing is different from family history genetic
testing or genetic cancer risk testing. This
testing looks for changes only in the CBCL
cells that have developed over time, and not
changes in the rest of your body’s cells.

Testing of your lymphoma cells
can gather specific information
about your lymphoma to help
guide treatment.

CBCL cells can have changes in genes and
chromosomes. Mutation testing using methods
such as high-throughput sequencing (HTS),
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH),
next-generation sequencing (NGS), karyotype,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used
to look for these changes or abnormalities.
Some mutations may determine the type of
treatment given. Subtle new drug-resistant
mutations may occur over time. Mutations can
also happen during treatment. Mutation testing
is used to look for these new mutations. Some
mutations lead to resistance to certain targeted
therapies. There are many possible mutations.

Inside our cells are DNA molecules. These
molecules are tightly packaged into what
is called a chromosome. Chromosomes
contain most of the genetic information in a
cell. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
Each chromosome contains thousands of
genes. Genes are coded instructions for the
proteins your cells make. A mutation is when
something goes wrong in the genetic code.
Proteins are written like this: BCL6. Genes
are written with italics like this: BCL6. When
a gene or protein is found (expressed), it is
shown with a plus sign (+) like this: CD30+.
When a gene or protein has not been found,
it is written with a negative sign (-) like this
CD30-.

Comparative genomic hybridization
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is
a technique that compares DNA samples from
normal tissue and tumor tissue. It is used to
detect abnormal chromosomes.

CBCL mutation testing
A sample of your skin, lymph node, blood, or
bone marrow will be used to see if the CBCL
cancer cells have any specific mutations.
Some mutations can be targeted with specific
therapies. This is separate from the genetic
testing for mutations that you may have
inherited from your biological parents.

2 Testing for CBCL » Testing for CBCL biomarker and genetic changes

FISH

Gene rearrangements

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. Since
this test doesn’t need growing cells, it can be
performed on bone marrow, lymph node, or
blood sample.

Normal B cells and T cells break their DNA
in certain ways to create diversity within your
immune system. In a tumor, all cancer cells
derive from the same original cell. In CBCL
that cell is a B cell. When that one B cell
divides many times, the entire group of B cells
is called clonal or the tumor is described as
having clonality. In clonal cells, the same gene
rearrangements are found in a group of cancer
cells. Pathologists have tests they can use to
determine if a group of cells is clonal or not.

FISH can find translocations that are too small
to be seen with other methods. A translocation
occurs when parts of two chromosomes switch
with one another. However, FISH can only
be used for known changes. It cannot detect
all the possible changes found within the
chromosomes or genes.

Biomarker and genetic testing is used to detect
B-cell rearrangements commonly found in
CBCL. This information can be helpful when
diagnosing and treating CBCL.

High-throughput sequencing
High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is capable
of sequencing hundreds of millions of DNA
molecules at a time.

Seek out support groups
at your local hospital,
through social media, or
through resources listed
in the back of this book.
Look to friends, relatives,
neighbors, and coworkers
for social support.

Karyotype

PCR

A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes.
Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
A karyotype will show extra, missing
(deletion), rearranged, or abnormal pieces of
chromosomes within the lymphoma cells.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions
of copies of your DNA or RNA (genetic
information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find
1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000
normal cells. These copies, called PCR
product, might be used for next-generation
sequencing (NGS). This is important when
testing for treatment response or remission.

Next-generation sequencing
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a
method used to determine a portion of a
person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene
has any mutations that might affect how the
gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more
detailed way than other methods and can find
mutations that other methods might miss.

Translocations
Translocation is a switching of parts between
two chromosomes. A translocation between
chromosome 14 and 18 is written as t(14;18).
This translocation is rare in CBCL. Specific
translocations such as t(14;18) can help
distinguish between types of blood cancers
and disorders.

2 Testing for CBCL » TNM scores

TNM scores

T = Skin
Lesions or tumors will be measured by their
depth, height, size, and region of the body.
Lesions are often measured in centimeters
(cm). Body regions are based on regional
lymph node drainage patterns. Body regions
include head/neck, chest, upper arm, lower
arm and hand, abdomen and genitals, upper
leg, lower leg and feet, upper back, lower
back, and buttocks.

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage many cancers such as CBCL.
In this system, the letters T, N, and M describe
different areas of cancer growth. Based on
biopsy and other test results, your doctor will
assign a score or number to each letter. The
higher the number, the larger the tumor or the
more the cancer has spread to lymph nodes
or other organs. A TNM example might look
like this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M0.








T is for skin – Tumor refers to size,
type, and number of tumors or lesions
covering the skin.

•

N is for lymph node – Cancer can
spread to lymph nodes.

•

M is for metastasis – Cancer can
spread to distant parts of the body.



Cancer staging is often done twice.




T1 – Solitary (one) skin lesion

Clinical stage (c) is the rating given
before any treatment. It is based on a
physical exam, biopsy, and other tests.

T2a is disease limited to an area
smaller than a 15-cm wide circle.
T2b is disease limited to an area the
size of a 15-cm to 30-cm wide circle.
T2c is disease found in a 30-cm or
larger area.

T3 – Generalized skin involvement
•

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

T1b is one lesion 5 cm or larger.

T2 – Regional skin involvement is
multiple lesions limited to 1 body region
or 2 body regions next to one another
(contiguous).
•

Pathologic stage (p) or surgical
stage is determined by examining tissue
removed during surgery such as in the
removal of a lymph node. Pathologic
features include size, shape, and type of
cell.

T1a is one lesion smaller than 5
centimeters (cm). For comparison, a
golf ball is about 4 cm.

T3a is multiple lesions involving 2 body
regions not next to one another.
T3b is multiple lesions involving 3 or
more body regions.

2 Testing for CBCL » TNM scores

N = Node
There are hundreds of lymph nodes
throughout your body. Lymph nodes work
as filters to help fight infection and remove
harmful things. Lymph node regions are
based on the Ann Arbor Staging System.
Peripheral sites include antecubital, cervical,
supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal-femoral, and
popliteal. Central sites include mediastinal,
pulmonary hilar, para-aortic, and iliac.

N0 means no cancer found in lymph
nodes.
N1 means involvement of 1 peripheral
lymph node region that drains an area of
current or prior skin involvement. Lymph
node biopsy tests positive for lymphoma.
N2 means involvement of 2 or more
peripheral lymph node regions or
involvement of any lymph node region
that does not drain an area of current
or prior skin involvement. Lymph node
biopsy tests positive for lymphoma.
N3 means cancer is found in central
lymph nodes. Lymph node biopsy tests
positive for lymphoma.

M = Metastasis
Cancer that has spread to distant parts of
the body is called metastatic. Cancer can
metastasize to internal (visceral) organs like
the liver or spleen.




M0 means no cancer is found in visceral
organs.
M1 means cancer is found in visceral
organs.

This chapter presents an overview

Depending on your diagnosis, your team might
include the following specialists:

of the possible types of treatment
and what to expect. Not everyone



will receive the same treatment.


Treatment options are based on
many factors. Together, you and
your care team will choose a
treatment plan that is best for you.



Care team


Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL) are
treatable and may be curable in certain cases.



Treating cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.





Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout cancer treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it. Get to know
your care team and help them get to know you.

Psychologists and psychiatrists
are mental health experts who can help
manage issues such as depression,
anxiety, or other mental health conditions
that can affect how you think and feel.
Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional issues. The anxiety a
person feels when diagnosed with cancer
might be managed by a social worker
in some cancer centers. They, or other
designated professionals, can help
navigate the complexities of financial and
insurance stresses.

3 Treating CBCL » Preventing pregnancy during treatment

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment

during and after treatment is recommended. If
you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time
of your cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will
need to be avoided.

Cancer and cancer treatment can affect the
ovaries and damage sperm. If you become
pregnant during chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or other types of systemic therapy,
serious birth defects can occur. Speak with your
care team about preventing pregnancy while
being treated for cancer. Hormonal birth control
may or may not be recommended, so ask
your doctor about options such as intrauterine
devices (IUDs) and barrier methods. Types of
barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms,
cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge.

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
period may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended during and after treatment.
Consult your doctor for the best time to plan a
pregnancy.

Those with testicles

Those with ovaries

Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth
control) such as condoms to prevent
pregnancy during and immediately after cancer
treatment.

Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby
if you are or become pregnant during treatment.
Therefore, birth control to prevent pregnancy

Standard of care is the
best-known way to treat a
particular disease based on
past clinical trials. There may
be more than one treatment
regimen that is considered

3 Treating CBCL » Surgery » Skin-directed therapy

Surgery

(Targretin gel) and tazarotene (Tazorac
Gel, Tazorac Cream).

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove a lesion or tumor from the body. The
type of surgery depends on size, location, and
number of tumors. It is also called excision or
excisional surgery. The usual role for surgery
in CBCL is to biopsy suspicious lesions, not to
completely remove (excise) the lymphoma.

Local radiation therapy
Local radiation therapy (RT) treats the skin
lesion. Involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT) is
a type of local radiation that might be used to
treat skin lesions.

Phototherapy

Skin-directed therapy

Phototherapy uses different ultraviolet (UV) light
wavelengths to treat skin lesions or tumors.
Phototherapy prescribed by your treatment
team uses carefully selected wavelengths to
target the skin lymphoma. It is very different
from the radiation given in tanning beds. Using
tanning beds increases your risk of other skin
cancers and is not recommended.

Types of therapy focused on the skin
include topical therapy, local radiation, and
phototherapy.

Topical therapy
A topical treatment is put on the surface of
the skin. It might be a lotion (cream), gel,
or ointment. Types of topical therapy are
described next.








Types include:


Corticosteroids (steroids) are used
to reduce inflammation. Steroids can be
topical or intralesional. An intralesional
steroid is injected directly into a lesion on
or just below the skin.





Imiquimod is used to treat certain types
of flat, scaly growths on the skin. Brand
names include Aldara and Zyclara.
Nitrogen mustard
(mechlorethamine hydrochloride)
stops or slows the growth of cancer.
Brand names include Valchlor and
Ledaga.



Retinoids are products related to
vitamin A. Examples include bexarotene

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

Ultraviolet B (UVB) – exposes the skin
to an artificial UVB light source for a set
length of time on a regular schedule.
Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)
– uses a very specific UV wavelength.
Photochemotherapy or psoralen
plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) – combines
psoralen (P) with UVA. Psoralen is a type
of medicine taken by mouth (orally) that
causes your skin to be sensitive to light.
After taking psoralen, the skin is exposed
to long-wave UV light.
Ultraviolet A1 (UVA1) - penetrates
deep into the skin causing T cells to die.

UV can increase your risk of some skin
cancers. Phototherapy may not be favored

27

3 Treating CBCL » Radiation therapy

in those with a history of skin cancer, or who
have had melanoma.

Less common types of EBRT that may be
used to treat CBCL include:


Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, electrons, and
other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink
tumors. RT can be given alone or with other
treatments. Treatment may focus on individual
tumors, a small area/region of the body, the
entire surface of the skin, or specific lymph
nodes. RT may be used as supportive care or
palliative care to help ease pain or discomfort
caused by cancer.







EBRT
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s) or areas of the body.



The most common type of EBRT that may be
used to treat CBCL is:


Involved-site radiation therapy
(ISRT) targets a specific area of skin. It
can also be used to treat specific lymph
nodes with cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

28

Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses
computer software and CT images to aim
beams that match the shape of the tumor.
Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape of
the tumor.
Stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) uses high-energy
radiation beams to treat cancers in five or
fewer treatments.
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
uses special equipment to position the
body and give one precise, large dose of
radiation.
Particle beam RT uses protons,
carbon ions, or other heavy ions to treat
cancer.

3 Treating CBCL » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy
Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
It includes retinoids, chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy
might be used alone or with other therapies.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and normal cells. Methotrexate is an example
of a chemotherapy. When more than one
chemotherapy is used, it is called multiagent.

You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

Targeted therapy

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop the action
of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/
or survive.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a drug therapy that increases
the activity of your immune system. By doing
so, it improves your body’s ability to find and
destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy can be
given alone or with other types of treatment.
Rituximab (Rituxan) is an example of an
immunotherapy.

Turmeric



Ginkgo biloba



Green tea extract



St. John’s Wort



Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care
medicines given during systemic therapy.
Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.

Retinoids
Retinoids are products related to vitamin A
that can stop the growth of cancer cells. When
taken by mouth (orally), they work throughout
the body.

3 Treating CBCL » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, lab
tests, or general health. These requirements
ensure that participants are alike in specific
ways and that the trial is as safe as possible
for the participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.








Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Finding a clinical trial

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
It depends on the study, your health insurance,
and the state in which you live. In general,
procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered
standard of care will be billed to you or
your insurance, whereas those considered
research are covered by the trial sponsor. Your
treatment team and the research team can
help determine if you are responsible for any
costs.

3 Treating CBCL » General supportive care

General supportive care

All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important to tell your
care team about all of your side
effects so they can be managed.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to prevent,
reduce, and relieve suffering, and to improve
quality of life. Supportive care might include
pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual
support, financial aid, or family counseling. Tell
your care team how you are feeling and about
any side effects so they can be managed.
Supportive care, best supportive care, and
palliative care often mean the same thing.

issues, and second cancers. The sooner late
effects are treated the better. Ask your care
team about what late effects could occur. This
will help you know what to look for.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.

Survivorship

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

A personalized survivorship care plan will
contain a summary of possible long-term
effects of treatment called late effects and list
follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care
provider will coordinate with specialists for your
follow-up care.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social health

There is more than one type

PCFCL

of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma

PCFCL (or CFCL) is generally slow-growing
and most often found in the scalp and
forehead. PCFCL develops slowly over months
or years and may look like a single tumor or
several nodules grouped together. Tumors are
pink or reddish and slightly raised and smooth.
Usually, PCFCL is BCL6-positive, CD20positive, IRF4/MUM1-negative, CD3-negative,
and FOXP1-negative. Treatment for PCFCL
will be discussed in this chapter.

(CBCL). This chapter discusses
treatment options for those
with primary cutaneous follicle
center lymphoma (PCFCL) and
primary cutaneous marginal zone
lymphoma (PCMZL).

PCMZL
PCMZL (or CMZL) is also called PCMZ
lymphoproliferative disorder. It is generally
slow-growing and most often found in the torso
and limbs. It appears as pink or red papules,
nodules, and/or tumors. PCMZL is always
negative for BCL6 and CD10, and often
BCL2-positive. Treatment for PCMZL will be
discussed in this chapter.

Diagnosis

Treatment

A skin biopsy is an important part of diagnosis.
Since it is very difficult to distinguish between
PCFCL and PC-DLBCL, leg type, biopsy
results should be reviewed by an expert
pathologist. Immunophenotyping will help
determine the specific type of primary
cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (PCBCL).

After diagnosis, further testing will be done
to plan treatment. This section discusses
treatment for PCFCL and PCMZL. Treatment
is based on the number of skin lesions and
their location. Disease may be solitary,
regional, generalized skin only, or generalized
extracutaneous.

Solitary or regional disease

Generalized skin-only disease

A solitary lesion is one lesion (T1). Regional
lesions can be multiple lesions limited to one
body region or two adjoining regions (T2).
Disease area will be measured.

Generalized skin-only disease covers a larger
area of the body than regional disease. There
are multiple lesions that involve 2 or more
body regions (T3) not next to one another.
Disease is not found in lymph nodes, blood, or
other organs.

Options include:




Local involved-site radiation theray (ISRT)
(preferred)

Treatment options include:

In some cases, observation, removal of
lesion (excision), skin-directed therapy, or
intralesional steroids

Local ISRT is the preferred initial treatment,
but not necessarily the preferred treatment for
relapse. Initial treatment is the first treatment
used. It might be called primary treatment.
After initial treatment, response will be
assessed. You might enter a period of
observation if there are no signs of disease.
If cancer returns or progresses, treatment will
depend on the number of lesions and regions,
and whether or not there are any symptoms.



Observation



Skin-directed therapy



Local ISRT



Intralesional steroids



Rituximab



Other systemic therapy

Treatment targets the skin lesions. Some
treatments are placed directly on or in the
lesion, while others work inside the body. ISRT
targets a specific area of skin. Observation
or watch-and-wait might be an option for
someone without symptoms (asymptomatic).
After initial treatment, response will be
assessed. You might enter a period of
observation if there are no signs of disease.

Relapse is cancer that returns after a
disease-free period. If cancer relapses
or progresses, treatment will be based
on if disease is generalized (skin only) or
extracutaneous (outside the skin).
Refractory disease is disease that is
not responding to treatment. It may be
resistant at the beginning of treatment or
it may become resistant during treatment.
For refractory disease, a different therapy
will be given.

4 PCFCL and PCMZL » Treatment

Extracutaneous disease

An intralesional steroid is
injected directly into a lesion on
or immediately below the skin.

Extracutaneous disease is found in areas
other than the skin. This is cancer that might
be found in the lymph nodes, blood, or organs.
If you have skin-only disease and later develop
extracutaneous disease, you will keep your
original diagnosis, but the stage will change.
If you have a skin lesion and testing finds
extracutaneous disease at the time of initial
diagnosis, you often (but not always) would
be classified as having systemic lymphoma.
Treatments are based on the type of B-cell
lymphoma.

Your preferences about
treatment are always
important. If you have any
religious or personal beliefs
about certain kinds of
treatment, share them with
your care team and make
your wishes known.

Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma
(PCBCL or CBCL) starts in B cells, a type
of white blood cell.
A skin biopsy is an important part of
diagnosis. Results should be reviewed by
an expert pathologist.

We want your
feedback!

Immunophenotyping will help determine
the specific type of PCBCL.

Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.

Lesions or tumors will be measured by
their depth, height, size, and region of
the body. Lesions are often measured in
centimeters (cm).

Take our survey to let us know
what we got right and what we
could do better.

Body regions are based on regional
lymph node drainage patterns. Body
regions include head/neck, chest, upper
arm, lower arm and hand, abdomen and
genitals, upper leg, lower leg and feet,
upper back, lower back, and buttocks.

NCCN.org/patients/feedback

Treatment is based on the number of skin
lesions and their location.
Generalized extracutaneous disease is
found in areas other than the skin. Cancer
may be in lymph nodes, blood, or internal
organs such as the liver or spleen.

relationship with your care team, it will help
you feel supported when considering options
and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are personal. What is
important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:




What you want and how that might differ
from what others want

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Your religious and spiritual beliefs

Support groups



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.
