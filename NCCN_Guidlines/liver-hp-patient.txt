About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Hepatobiliary Cancers Version 1.2023 – March 10, 2023.

The liver is a large organ located on the right
side of the body under the rib cage. Inside
the liver is a network of blood and lymph
vessels. The liver filters blood, helps with blood
clotting, makes bile, breaks down fats, and
helps process sugar for energy. The liver also
produces lymph. Lymph gives cells water and
food and contains white blood cells that fight
germs.

The liver has two lobes, a right and left lobe.
Blood enters the liver from the hepatic artery
and the portal vein. Blood leaves the liver

and when you eat, it then passes through the
bile ducts into the small intestine to help digest
food.

Liver cells make bile. Bile is a yellow or green
fluid made up of cholesterol, bilirubin, salts
such as potassium and sodium, water, and
other elements found in the body. It flows
into small channels that drain into thin tubes
called ducts. These ducts form larger and
larger channels that flow into the left and right
hepatic ducts. The left and right hepatic ducts
join to form the common hepatic duct. The
common hepatic duct joins with the cystic
duct that connects to the gallbladder to form
the common bile duct. The common bile duct
is joined by the pancreatic duct just before it
enters the small intestine.

The hepatobiliary system
The liver is part of the hepatobiliary system.
“Hepato” means liver and “biliary” refers to the
gallbladder and bile ducts. Together, they form
the hepatobiliary system. The hepatobiliary
system makes bile and is a part of the
digestive system. The digestive system takes
in food, breaks it down, absorbs nutrients, and
removes waste from the body. Some doctors
consider the pancreas to be a part of this
system.

The gallbladder
The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped
organ found under the liver. It is sometimes
described as sac-like because it holds bile
from the liver. Bile is stored in the gallbladder,

Liver cancer

In the following pages, this patient guideline
will focus on the most common type of liver
cancer, HCC, and its treatment.

Cancer that starts in the liver is called primary
liver cancer. Secondary liver cancer is when
other cancer types spread to the liver. For
example, cancer can start in the intestines
(colon) and spread to the liver. This is called
metastatic colon cancer to the liver.

How liver cancer spreads
Liver cancer can spread in many ways. It can
spread directly through the liver. It can also
spread to an area far from the primary tumor
called a distant metastasis. Liver cancer most
often metastasizes to the lung or bone. This is
called metastatic liver cancer.

There is more than one type of primary liver
cancer in adults. The most common type
is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There
is a subtype of HCC called fibrolamellar
hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHC). FLHC
affects very few people and usually occurs at a
younger age.

Inside the liver are blood and lymphatic
vessels. Cancer can spread from the liver
through the blood and lymphatic system. The
lymphatic system is made up of a network of
vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph.
Lymph gives cells water and food, and it has
white blood cells that fight germs. Lymph
nodes filter lymph and remove the germs.
Although possible, HCC does not commonly
spread to nearby lymph nodes.

The second most common type of primary
liver cancer in adults is called intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, which is a cancer of the
bile ducts. Other primary liver cancers in adults
include rare types of sarcoma that start in the
blood vessel cells of the liver. Another rare
type is made of both hepatocellular carcinoma
and cholangiocarcinoma. This is called a
mixed-type tumor.
More information on gallbladder and bile
duct tumors is available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Liver cancer basics » Risk factors

Risk factors

Cirrhosis

Risk is your chance of developing liver cancer.
Everyone has some risk for developing
liver cancer. However, some people are at
increased risk. Risk factors can be activities
that people do, things in the environment,
or traits passed from biological parents to
children through genes. Genes are a set of
instructions that tell new cells what to become
(for example, heart, liver, and skin) and what to
do (make hormones, absorb nutrients, and kill
germs).

Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver. It is a type of
long-term (chronic) liver disease where liver
cells are replaced by scar tissue. If you have
cirrhosis, you should be screened for liver
cancer.
Cirrhosis can be caused by:

Risk is based on:



Hepatitis B virus or infection



Hepatitis C virus or infection



Alcohol use



Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)



Those with cirrhosis



Genetic hemochromatosis



Those without cirrhosis



Stage 4 primary biliary cholangitis



Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency



Other causes of cirrhosis

Known risk factors are listed in Guide 1.

Guide 1
Risk factors for developing liver cancer
Those with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B should be enrolled in a liver cancer screening program
Risk factors for those with cirrhosis:
• Hepatitis B virus or infection
• Hepatitis C virus or infection
• Alcohol use
• Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
• Genetic hemochromatosis
• Stage 4 primary biliary cholangitis
• Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
• Other causes of cirrhosis
Risk factors for those without cirrhosis:
• Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or infection
• Additional risk factors include HBV carrier with family history of liver cancer, Asian male
assigned sex at birth 40 years of age or over, Asian female assigned sex at birth 50 years of
age or over, and African/North American Black persons with hepatitis B

Liver cancer basics » Hepatitis » Liver cancer screening

Hepatitis

Liver cancer screening

Hepatitis is a type of liver disease. Viruses
called hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV)
are spread by contact with blood and other
bodily fluids. HBV and HCV can cause chronic
hepatitis, scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver
failure, and liver cancer. If you have chronic
HBV, you should be screened for liver cancer.

Screening helps find disease early before
symptoms occur, when it is more likely to be
cured with treatment. The goal of liver cancer
screening is to find liver cancer early in those
who are at risk for developing liver cancer. Two
tests are recommended every 6 months for
those at risk of developing liver cancer.

Other risk factors

They include:

High alcohol use can cause damage to the
liver. Having NAFLD may lead to cirrhosis in
those who drink little or no alcohol. NAFLD is
seen in those with high weight, diabetes, high
cholesterol, or other conditions. Diabetes, high
weight, or other problems with processing
sugar may put someone at risk for liver cancer.
Genetic hemochromatosis is an inherited
condition that causes the liver to store too
much iron from food.



An ultrasound (US)



An alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test

An ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves
to take pictures of the inside of the body.
A blood test checks for the protein AFP. An
elevated or rising AFP might be a sign of
primary liver cancer. This is cancer that starts
in the liver.
Follow-up steps after a screening ultrasound
may include:






NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

If AFP is elevated or an ultrasound finds
nodules that are 10 millimeters (mm) or
larger, then you will have more tests.
Nodules are small, round areas of tissue.
Not all nodules are cancer.
If an ultrasound finds nodules that
are smaller than 10 mm, repeat the
ultrasound and AFP in 3 to 6 months.
If an ultrasound is negative, repeat the
ultrasound and AFP in 6 months.

“

Although living with liver disease
is physically and emotionally
challenging, I have been able to
live a normal life – traveling,
snorkeling, having children. So,
do not limit yourself and do not
hold back from doing something
because you are scared or you
are worried about the 'what ifs.'
If you live your life with those
limitations, you’ll have no life at
all.”

Screening is when tests are done on
a regular basis to detect a disease in
someone without symptoms. If you have
cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B, then
you should be enrolled in a liver cancer
screening program.
Screening helps find disease early when
it is more likely to be cured with treatment.
The goal of liver cancer screening is to
find liver cancer early in those who are at
risk for developing liver cancer.

with imaging tests. More tests
will be done to plan treatment.
Sometimes, a biopsy is needed



to confirm cancer. This chapter
presents an overview of the tests
you might receive and what to
expect.



Test results
Results from blood tests, imaging studies,
and biopsy will be used to determine your
treatment plan. Treatment will be based on
these findings. It is important you understand
what these tests mean. Ask questions and
keep copies of your test results. Online patient
portals are a great way to access your test
results.







In your contact list, include information on
your exact type of cancer, as well as any
treatments and the date each treatment
started.

General health tests
Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
(OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you
take. Some supplements interact and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.
Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.
Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Liver Cancer, 2023

Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.
They are great partners in your care.

A list of tests used for treatment planning can
be found in Guide 2.

Keep these things in mind:


Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.

Diagnosing liver cancer » General health tests

Family history

Physical exam

Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your health care provider will ask
about the health history of family members
who are blood relatives. This information is
called a family history. Ask family members
on both sides of your family about their
health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific
type of cancer or where the cancer started, if it
is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic
testing.

During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:


Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat





Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.
Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

Diagnosing liver cancer » Blood tests

Blood tests
Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein. Some
blood tests are described next.

Create a medical binder
A medical binder or notebook is a great way
to organize all of your records in one place.

Complete blood count

3 Make copies of blood tests, imaging

A complete blood count (CBC) measures
the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in
your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells fight
infection, and platelets control bleeding.

3 Choose a binder that meets your

needs. Consider a zipper pocket to
include a pen, small calendar, and
insurance cards.

Comprehensive metabolic panel

3 Create folders for insurance forms,

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures 14 different substances in your
blood. It is usually done on the plasma part
of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.



test types (such as blood, imaging,
pathology, radiology, and genetics),
treatments, and procedures. Organize
items in the folder by date.

3 Use online patient portals to view

your test results and other records.
Download or print the records to add to
your binder.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a waste
product filtered out of the blood by the
kidneys. A high level of BUN can be a
sign your kidneys aren’t working well.

3 Add a section for questions and to take
notes.

Creatinine is a waste product produced in
the muscles. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys and tells how well the
kidneys are working.

Bring your medical binder to appointments.
You never know when you might need it!

Liver function panel
One of the chemicals measured by LFTs is
bilirubin, a chemical that gives bile its color.
There may be too much bilirubin in the blood if
a tumor is blocking a bile duct and preventing
the free flow of bile from the liver into the
intestines or the liver is not working as well
as it should. Too much bilirubin causes a

Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that
are made or processed by the liver. Levels

Fibrosis score

yellowing of the eyes and skin called jaundice.
It might cause itchy skin and dark-colored
urine.

Fibrosis is mild scarring of liver tissue.
Cirrhosis is when this scarring becomes
severe. A fibrosis score measures the level of
scarring to the liver caused by disease. This
scoring system uses a 0 to 6 scale.

Tests to measure the following might be done:



Albumin
Transaminases such as aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
transaminase (ALT)



Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)



Prothrombin time (PT)



International normalized ratio (INR)





F1 – Fibrosis score of 5 to 6 is severe
fibrosis or cirrhosis

A fibrosis score is based on a biopsy or
surgery sample. There are ultrasound and
blood tests that can estimate fibrosis and
the score, as well. You may be referred to
a hepatologist if your testing indicates the
presence of fibrosis or cirrhosis in your liver.

Some of these tests are used to determine
your Child-Pugh class. Levels that are too high
or low may be a sign of liver damage or cancer
spread.

Child-Pugh class

Hepatitis panel

The Child-Pugh score measures the severity
of liver disease such as cirrhosis. This score
helps your treatment team see how well your
liver is working and if surgery is an option.

Hepatitis is a type of liver disease. Viruses
called hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C
(HCV) are the most common types of chronic
hepatitis. A hepatitis panel is a blood test that
checks to see if you have a hepatitis infection
caused by one of these viruses. Chronic
(long-term) hepatitis B and a current or past
infection with hepatitis C increase the risk for
liver cancer and biliary tract cancers. Hepatitis
causes the liver to become inflamed and not
work as it should. HBV can cause scarring of
the liver, liver failure, and cancer.

This system includes:


Class A (lowest surgery risk)



Class B (intermediate surgery risk)



Class C (highest surgery risk)

The class is based on signs, symptoms, and
blood test results. Those with a Child-Pugh
Class A have the lowest risk of complications
or death from surgery. In some cases,
those with Child-Pugh Class B might be
recommended for surgery.

A hepatitis panel will tell your treatment team
if you had hepatitis in the past or if you have it
today. You may be referred to a hepatologist
if you test positive. A hepatologist is a doctor
who specializes in the care of the liver, biliary
tract, gallbladder, and pancreas.

Diagnosing liver cancer » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

A special camera will take pictures of the
tracer in your bones as it moves over your
body. Areas of bone damage take up more
radiotracer than healthy bone and show up
as bright spots on the pictures. Bone damage
can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment,
previous injuries, or other health issues.

Liver cancer is usually confirmed with imaging
tests. Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body. Imaging tests show the primary
tumor, or where the cancer started, and
look for cancer in other parts of the body. A
radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report to
your health care provider (HCP). It is likely that
the report will be sent directly to you through
your patient portal or patient access system.
You should discuss these results with your
HCP.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that
help enhance and improve the images of
several organs and structures in the body. It is
used to make the pictures clearer. The contrast
is not permanent and will leave the body in
your urine immediately after the test. The types
of contrast vary and are different for CT and
MRI.

You will have some but not all the following
tests.

Bone scan
Liver cancer can spread to bones. A bone scan
uses a radiotracer, a substance that releases
small amounts of radiation. Before the pictures
are taken, the tracer will be injected into your
vein. It can take a few hours for the tracer to
enter your bones. However, the test is quick
and painless.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast

CT machine
A CT machine is large
and has a tunnel in
the middle. During the
test, you will lie on the
table that moves slowly
through the tunnel.

or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

CT scan

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your chest,
abdomen, and/or pelvis may be one of the
tests to look for cancer. In most cases, contrast
will be used.

Dynamic MRI scan
In a dynamic MRI scan, there are two scans:
one without contrast and one with contrast.
First, a scan is done without contrast. Then,
contrast is injected into a vein and another
scan is done.

Dynamic CT scan
In a dynamic CT scan, there are two scans:
one without contrast and one with contrast.
First, a scan is done without contrast. Then,
contrast is injected into a vein and another
scan is done.

MRCP
A magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a type of
MRI scan that makes very clear pictures of the
pancreas and bile ducts. No contrast is used
because bile and other fluids act as their own
contrast. An MRCP is usually done with an
MRI scan.

Multiphasic CT scan
A multiphasic CT scan is similar to a dynamic
CT scan. It starts without contrast. Then
contrast is added and multiple sets of pictures
are taken as the contrast moves through the
arteries and veins of the liver. This allows your
care team to see where the tumor is in the liver
and if the tumor involves any veins, arteries, or
organs.

PET scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive sugar molecule called a
tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a
vein to see where cancer spots might be in
the body and if they are using sugar produced
by the body to grow. Cancer spots show up
as bright areas on PET scans. However, not
all tumors will appear on a PET scan and not
all bright spots are cancer. It is normal for the
brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright
on the PET scan. Inflammation or infection can
also show up as a bright spot. When a PET

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the

body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as

Ultrasound

Types of possible biopsies include:

An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to a sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer)

a microscope to find disease. A sample of your
tumor will be tested to look for biomarkers or
proteins. This information is used to choose
the best treatment for you. It is sometimes
called molecular testing.

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be rated
using a PS scale called Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) or the Karnofsky
Performance Score (KPS).

Tumor biomarker tests
Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9),
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and alphafetoprotein (AFP) are examples of tumor
markers that are occasionally made by tumors
and can be detected in the blood. These tumor
markers can help with diagnosis, monitoring
response to treatment, and surveillance.

The ECOG PS scores range from 0 to 5. PS
might be referred to as good or poor. Good PS
is usually PS 0 or PS 1.
The KPS score ranges from 0 to 100.
PS is one factor taken into consideration when
choosing a treatment plan. Your preferences
about treatment are always important.

Tumor mutation testing
A sample of your tumor or blood may be
tested to see if the cancer cells have any
specific mutations. Some mutations, such as
NTRK and RET gene fusions or microsattelite
instability-high (MSI-H)/deficient mismatch
repair (dMMR) mutations, can be targeted with
specific therapies. Tumor mutation testing is
separate from genetic testing for mutations
that you may have inherited from your
biological parents.

Liver cancer staging » How liver cancer is staged

Cancer staging is used to reflect



prognosis and to guide treatment
decisions. It describes the size



and location of the tumor(s) and
if cancer has spread to lymph



nodes, organs, or other parts of
the body.

A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging.





Anatomic – based on extent of cancer
as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node
status (N), and distant metastasis (M).
Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM
plus tumor grade and the status of the
biomarkers or mutations. The prognostic
stage also includes the assumption that
you are treated with the standard-of-care
approaches.

Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and
pathologic. Clinical stage (c) is the rating given
before any treatment. It is based on a physical
exam, biopsy, and imaging tests. An example
might look like cT3. Pathologic stage (p) or
surgical stage is determined by examining
tissue removed during surgery. An example
might be pT3. If you are given drug therapy
before surgery, then the stage might look like
ypT3. Staging after surgery provides more
specific and accurate details about the size of
the cancer and lymph node status.

Information gathered during AJCC staging:
The extent (size) of the tumor (T):
How large is the cancer? Has it grown
into nearby areas?
The spread to nearby lymph nodes
(N): Has the cancer spread to nearby
lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where?

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Liver Cancer, 2023

Biomarker and mutation testing:
Does the cancer have any genes,
proteins, markers, or mutations that might
suggest treatment?

Staging includes:

Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A
prognosis is the course your cancer will likely
take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.
The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)
Staging System is another type. In BCLC,
tumor size and liver function are used.



Grade of the cancer (G): How much
do the cancer cells look like normal cells?

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins. Doctors may
explain your cancer stage in different ways
than described next.



The spread (metastasis) to distant
sites (M): Has the cancer spread to
distant organs such as the lungs or bone?

Liver cancer staging » TNM scores

TNM scores

T = Tumor

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage liver cancer. In this system, the
letters T, N, and M describe different areas of
cancer growth. Based on cancer test results,
a score or number will be given to each letter.
The higher the number, the larger the tumor or
the more the cancer has spread. These scores
will be combined to assign the cancer a stage.
A TNM example might look like this: T3N2M0
or T3, N2, M0.


The primary tumor size is measured in
centimeters (cm). A large pea is 1 cm. A golf
ball is 4 cm.

Treating liver cancer » Surgery

Surgery

Partial hepatectomy (liver
resection)

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. Often, surgery
is the main or primary treatment to remove
the cancer from the liver. This is only one part
of a treatment plan. Surgery can also provide
supportive care by easing pain or discomfort.
This is called palliative surgery.

A partial hepatectomy is surgery to remove a
portion of the liver. It might be a small wedge
resection or removal of an entire lobe. The
part of the liver that remains will keep working,
and the missing section will regrow. A partial
hepatectomy is different than a liver transplant.

When preparing for surgery, seek the opinion
of an experienced surgeon. The surgeon
should be an expert in performing your type of
surgery. Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating liver cancer.

A partial hepatectomy is not for everyone.
Liver damage, such as cirrhosis or fibrosis, can
make surgery more difficult or not possible.
The size and location of the tumor, as well
as your liver function (Child-Pugh score), will
play a role in determing if tumor resection is
the best option for you. You must also have
a working liver and be healthy enough for
surgery.

The removal of the cancer through surgery can
be accomplished in different ways depending
on the specific circumstances, such as the
size and location of the tumor, and if there is
cancer in any surrounding organs and tissues.
Surgery is based on the safest and best way to
remove the cancer.

Goal of surgery
The goal of surgery or tumor resection is to
remove all of the cancer. To do so, the tumor
is removed along with a rim of normal-looking
tissue around its edge called the surgical
margin. The surgical margin may look normal
during surgery, but cancerous cells may be
found when viewed under a microscope by a
pathologist. A clear or negative margin (R0) is
when no cancer cells are found in the tissue
around the edge of the tumor. In a positive
margin, cancer cells are found in normallooking tissue around the tumor. If there is a
positive margin, you may have another surgery
to try to remove the remaining tumor cells.
Surgery includes removal of lymph nodes.

You might have more than one surgery. You
might also have a wound drain to prevent fluid
from collecting in the body after surgery.

Tumor resection
The removal of the tumor is called tumor
resection. Imaging tests will be ordered to see
if your cancer is resectable (can be removed
completely by surgery) or unresectable
(cannot be removed completely by surgery).
Sometimes, imaging tests cannot clearly show
one way or the other.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Liver Cancer, 2023

Some undergo tumor or liver ablation at the
time of surgery. Ablation uses heat to destroy
tumors. You and your care team will decide
whether resection, ablation, or both is right for
you.

29

Treating liver cancer » Liver transplant

Liver transplant

Other treatments may be given if you are
waiting for a transplant. These treatments are
called bridging therapy and include ablation
and arterially directed therapy (embolization).

In a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed
and replaced with a healthy donor liver. The
new liver may be donated from a person who
recently died or a section of liver may be
donated from a living person. A liver transplant
is based on certain size limits and tumor
locations.

There is still a chance that cancer will return
after a liver transplant. It is also possible your
body will reject the donor liver. You will be
given medicine to prevent rejection.

The liver is divided into 8 sections or segments
based on portal vein and bile duct locations.
It is possible for someone to donate a portion
of the liver. Structures such as the inferior
vena cava, portal vein, hepatic artery, and
bile ducts are reconnected to the new liver.
Remember, a liver transplant can be a whole
liver replacement or just a portion.

Bridge therapy

A liver transplant may be an option for
those who can’t have a partial hepatectomy.
However, not everyone is a candidate for a
liver transplant.

Downstaging therapy

There can be long wait times to receive a liver
transplant. Treatments may be given while
you wait for a transplant. These treatments
are called bridge or bridging therapy and

Treating liver cancer » Ablation » Arterially directed therapy

Ablation

Arterially directed therapy

Ablation is a type of treatment that uses
extreme cold or heat, radio waves,
microwaves, or chemicals such as ethanol
(a type of alcohol) or acetic acid to destroy
cancer cells. It can destroy small tumors (3
cm or less) with little harm to nearby tissue.
Tumors must be in an area that can be
reached with ablation and not near other
organs, major blood vessels, or bile ducts.

Arterially directed therapy or embolization
includes embolization (TAE),
chemoembolization (TACE), drug-eluting
bead embolization (DEB-TACE), and
radioembolization (Y-90 or TARE). It treats
tumors by injecting particles, chemotherapy,
or radioactive beads directly into the blood
vessels that supply the tumor(s). A small
catheter is inserted into the artery and is
guided to the tumor. Once in place, the
particles, chemotherapy, or beads are injected.
Arterially directed therapy has risks. It might
not be used if your bilirubin level is above a
certain level.

Types of ablation include:






Chemical – Uses percutaneous ethanol
injection (PEI) or acetic acid injection to
kill cancer cells.

The common types of arterially directed
therapy include:

Thermal – Uses radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) to
kill cancer cells by heating them with highenergy radio waves or microwaves.



Cryoablation – Freezes cancer cells
with a very cold substance.

Ablation can be done through the skin
(percutaneous), through small cuts
(laparoscopic), or using a large incision like in
surgery (open approach). All types of ablation
use a special needle, called a probe, which
is inserted into the tumor. With cryotherapy,
a medical gas is passed through the probe
to cause below-freezing temperatures. This
freezes the tumor to destroy it. With RFA, the
probe emits radio waves to heat the tumor and
destroy it. The probe can be guided into place
with a CT scan, ultrasound, or other imaging
tests. The probe will be removed when
treatment is done.





Your care team will check the tumor size and
location, and how well your liver is working
before doing this treatment. RFA and MWA are
the most common types of ablation used.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Liver Cancer, 2023

32

Transarterial embolization (TAE)
involves blocking the blood supply to
the tumor by injecting tiny particles into
the blood vessels feeding the tumor(s).
Stopping the blood flow cuts off the
oxygen supply to the tumor and causes
cancer cells to die.
Chemoembolization (also
known as TACE or transarterial
chemoembolization) involves injecting
a chemotherapy mixture into the tumor
and blocking the feeding blood vessels to
the tumor(s).
DEB-TACE (drug-eluting bead
transarterial chemoembolization)
uses tiny particles loaded with
chemotherapy that are injected into
the blood vessels feeding the tumor(s).
The particles give off small amounts of
chemotherapy to the tumor over several
days.

Treating liver cancer » Radiation therapy



Radiation therapy

Transarterial radioembolization
(TARE or RE) uses tiny glass or resin
beads filled with the radioactive isotope
yttrium-90 that are injected directly into
the tumor(s). This procedure is often
referred to as Y-90.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, protons,
electrons, and other sources to kill cancer cells
and shrink tumors. RT can be given alone
or with other treatments. It might be used as
supportive care or palliative care to help ease
pain or discomfort caused by cancer, or to
control bleeding caused by a tumor. RT may
be a treatment for all tumors, regardless of
location.

Depending on the circumstances, arterially
directed therapy may be used as bridging
treatment before a liver transplant, as definitive
treatment, or for palliation. Definitive treatment
is defined as the best treatment after all
choices have been considered. The type of
arterially directed therapy recommended will
depend on the size, number, and location
of tumors as well as your previous medical
history and the expertise of your treating
physicians.

Most types of radiation include short treatment
sessions that are given once daily over a few

radiation option(s) are best for you and what

EBRT
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s) or areas of the body.

Standard of care is the bestknown way to treat particular
disease based on past clinical
trials. There may be more than
one treatment regimen that is
considered standard of care. Ask

Common types of EBRT that may be used to
treat your cancer include the following:





Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses
computer software and CT images to aim
beams that match the shape of the tumor.

For a list of some systemic therapies, see

Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape
of the tumor. This limits the amount of
radiation to normal tissue.

Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. It is used in arterially
directed therapy.

Guide 4.

Chemotherapy

Targeted therapy

Stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) uses high-energy
radiation beams to kill or ablate the tumor.

Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop or inhibit
the action of molecules that help cancer cells
grow and/or survive.

Systemic therapy
Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might
be used alone or with other therapies. Goals
of systemic therapy should be discussed
before starting treatment. Your wishes about

Targeted therapies may be used to treat

another gene fuse or join. This activates the
NTRK gene in a way that causes uncontrolled
cell growth. Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) and
entrectinib (Rozlytrek) might be used to target
cancer that is NTRK gene fusion-positive.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions

A biosimilar or substitute might be used in
place of bevacizumab. A biosimilar is an
almost identical version of a drug made by
another company. It is used in the exact same
way and at the same dose as the actual drug.
Biosimilars include Vegzelma, Mvasi, Zirabev,
and Alymsys.

You might be asked to stop taking
or avoid certain herbal supplements
when on a systemic therapy. Some
supplements can affect the ability of a
drug to do its job. This is called a drug
interaction.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment
that tries to reactivate the immune system
against tumor cells. The immune system
has many on and off switches. Tumors
take advantage of "off switches." Two
leading off switches are PD-1 and CTLA-4.
Immunotherapy can be given alone or with
other types of treatment.

It is critical to speak with your care
team about any supplements you may
be taking. Some examples include:

Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy. Therefore, it is very
important to tell your care team about any
medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter
(OTC) drugs, herbals, or supplements you
are taking.
Bring a list with you to every visit.

Treating liver cancer » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

Informed consent

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.








Phase I trials study the dose, safety, and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Liver Cancer, 2023

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Treating liver cancer » Supportive care

Side effects

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
Rarely. It depends on the study, your health
insurance, and the state in which you live.
In general, procedures, drugs, or tests that
are considered standard of care will be billed
to you or your insurance, whereas those
considered research are covered by the trial
sponsor. Your treatment team and the research
team can help determine if you are responsible
for any costs.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

Supportive care
Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Supportive care might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you are
feeling and about any side effects so they can
be managed. Best supportive care, supportive
care, and palliative care are often used
interchangeably.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. When treatment
leads to remission (or no evidence of disease),
you will need follow-up or survivorship care for
late effects. During survivorship care you will
still have a care team, but it will look different.
Seek out peer support groups, whether online
or in person.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.
Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment.

body. You may need a new or second stent
during or after cancer treatment if the tumor
grows. A biliary bypass is a surgery to re-route
the flow of bile from the common bile duct into
the small intestine. The result is that the bile
flow avoids (bypasses) the blocked part of the
duct.

Blocked bile duct
A tumor in the liver may grow large enough
to block your bile duct. A bile duct is a small
tube that drains digestive fluid (bile) from the
liver. The common bile duct carries bile from
the liver through the pancreas and into the
first part of the small intestine (duodenum).
A blocked duct causes bile to build up in the
liver. As a result, you may have pain, itching,
discomfort, and/or yellowing of the skin and
eyes. This is called jaundice. This blockage
can cause an infection of the bile duct called
cholangitis.

Difficulty eating
Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or its treatment might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating
is important during treatment. It includes eating
a balanced diet, eating the right amount of
food, and drinking enough fluids. A registered
dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food
can help. Speak to your care team if you have
trouble eating or maintaining weight.

A blocked bile duct may be treated by placing
a biliary stent or doing a biliary bypass. A
biliary stent is a tiny tube that is placed in the
bile duct to unblock it or keep it open. Before
the stent can be placed, bile may need to be
drained through an opening in the side of the

Distress

Keep a pain diary

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicine that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Include in your pain diary:

3 The time and dose of all medicines
3 When pain starts and ends or lessens
3 Where you feel pain
3 A description of your pain. Is it

throbbing, sharp, tingling, shooting, or
burning? Is it constant, or does it come

team. If you take the time to build a
relationship with your care team, it will help
you feel supported when considering options
and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects






Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, check out the websites listed in this
book.

Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life and length of life

Questions to ask

How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Possible questions to ask are listed on the
following pages. Feel free to use these
questions or come up with your own. Be clear
about your goals for treatment and find out
what to expect from treatment.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your care
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Liver Cancer, 2023

Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
