About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Small Cell Lung Cancer, Version 3.2024 — June 11, 2024.

What is lung cancer?



The lungs are the main organs of the
respiratory system. They deliver oxygen to
the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the
blood. The transfer of these gases in and out
of the body is called respiration.

Cancer cells grow out of control. They can
grow through the airway and into the lung
tissue. They can grow through the lung
wall and invade other body parts.
Cancer cells can break away from a
tumor and spread. They can enter the
bloodstream or a fluid called lymph and
spread to other places.

This out-of-control cell growth can harm the
body. Cancer cells crowd out and overwhelm
normal cells. Without enough normal cells,
cancer cells can cause organs to stop working.

Lung cancers form from cells that line the
airways of the lungs. The lungs' airways are
called the bronchus, bronchioli, and alveoli.

Scientists have learned a great deal about
cancer. As a result, today’s treatments work

Cancer cells make many new cancer
cells. They also do not die when they
should. This overgrowth of cancer cells
becomes a mass of tissue called a tumor.

better than treatments in the past. Also, many
people with cancer have more than one
treatment option.

Smoking cigarettes is the main cause of
SCLC. Almost everyone with SCLC smokes
or has smoked. Many people with SCLC have
regularly smoked more than a pack a day.

The two most common types of lung cancer are:




Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
further divided into:
•

Adenocarcinoma

•

Squamous cell carcinoma

•

Adenosquamous carcinoma

•

Large cell carcinoma

•

Sarcomatoid carcinoma

Exposure to second-hand smoke also
increases the risk of lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke exhaled by another
person and the smoke from combustible
tobacco products.
Although rare in Western countries, there
are occasions where people with no smoking
history develop this disease.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), further
divided into:
•
•

There are other unknown causes of SCLC.
Researchers are still learning why some
people who smoke never get lung cancer and
others who have never smoked do. A person’s
chances of getting SCLC are higher in the
following situations:

Small cell carcinoma
Combined (small and non-small) cell
lung carcinoma

The names of the cancers refer to their
appearance under a microscope. When
viewed with a microscope, SCLCs appear
small and blue.



Over 70 years of age



Prior radiation therapy to the chest



Sometimes lung tumors contain both small cell
and non-small cell lung cancer cells. These
are called combined (small and non-small) cell
lung carcinomas and are usually treated like
small cell lung cancer.

If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If you do
smoke, quit. New lung tumors are less likely to
develop after quitting smoking.

SCLC is much less common than NSCLC. It is
the focus of this book.

Nicotine addiction is one of the hardest
addictions to stop. The stress of having cancer
may make it even harder to quit. There is
help. Ask your health care providers about
counseling and medicines to help you quit.

NCCN has a two-part book series on NSCLC,
found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

What are the symptoms of
SCLC?

Some symptoms caused by SCLC are listed in

Guide 1.

SCLC is often found when it’s causing
symptoms or routine blood tests are abnormal.

SCLC can cause many types of symptoms.
The symptoms depend on where the lung
tumor has grown to or spread. SCLC can
prevent the lungs from getting the air they
need. Some people also have symptoms from
paraneoplastic syndromes, which are caused
by an abnormal body response to lung cancer.

Less often, it’s found in x-rays or CT scans
before symptoms start. Unlike other lung
cancers, it’s difficult to detect SCLC early
because it grows more quickly.

Airways of the lungs
Air moves through your body in a series of airways. It travels down your throat and
through the windpipe (trachea). The windpipe splits into 2 airways called bronchi.
Inside the lung, each bronchus branches off into the parts of the lung, called lobes.
The right lung has 3 lobes, and the left lung has 2 lobes. The bronchi divide into
smaller airways called the bronchioli. At the end of the bronchioli are sacs called
alveoli. Oxygen is transferred from air into the blood in the alveoli.

1 Lung cancer basics » What are the symptoms of SCLC?

Your primary care provider may be the first to
suspect that you have lung cancer. You will
need to see specialists to determine if you
have cancer. Your assessment team may
include the following board-certified experts:


Thoracic radiologist



Interventional radiologist



Pulmonologist



Thoracic surgeon



Medical oncologist



Radiation oncologist

To confirm that you have cancer, you’ll need
testing of your body tissue or fluid. Small
samples will be removed from your body
during a procedure called a biopsy.

Key points

There are many types of biopsies for lung
cancer. Some involve a needle while others
require cutting through body tissue. Most
biopsies are low-risk procedures and do not
cause any long lasting harm.



Your health care providers will decide what
biopsy is right for you and how they will test
the removed tissue.





Getting a biopsy does not pose a risk for the
cancer spreading.



What's the treatment for
SCLC?



The best treatment for SCLC depends on
the stage of the tumor, your health, and what
medicines your body responds to. Further
chapters describe treatment in detail.

Cancer cells don’t follow the rules of cell
growth. They make many new cancer
cells, invade nearby tissue, and spread to
other body parts.
The lungs help the body get the air it
needs to live.
Lung cancer often starts in the cells that
line the airways.
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) grows fast
and it has commonly spread outside the
lung by the time it’s found.
Smoking cigarettes is the main cause
of SCLC, but there are other unknown
causes.
Ask your health care provider for help
to quit smoking. Quitting may improve
treatment results and reduce side effects
of treatment.
SCLC is most often found when it’s
causing symptoms. Its symptoms depend
on where the cancer is growing in the
body.

A cancer stage is a rating of the
extent of cancer in the body. There

Cancer care involves a team
effort among the various health
care providers and the patient. It
is essential to be knowledgeable
about the cancer in order to make
educated decisions regarding the
care and treatment to be given.
With so much on the Internet,
much of which may be outdated,
publications, such as this book,
are essential to patients receiving
accurate and timely information so
that they further understand their
disease and treatments."

are two staging systems for smallcell lung cancer. A combined
system is better for treatment
planning. This chapter describes
these systems.

What is cancer staging?
At diagnosis, the degree of lung cancer
growth and its spread differ between people.
Cancer doctors needed a way to measure and
compare different cancer tumors.
A staging system is a standard way of
grouping lung cancers by their growth and
spread. Health care providers use cancer
staging to:

Lung cancer staging is based on the growth
and spread of cancer cells. Lung cancer cells
may:

2 Lung cancer staging » What is the VA staging system? » What is the TNM staging system?

What is the TNM staging
system?

There are 2 staging systems for small cell lung
cancer (SCLC).


VA (Veterans Administration) system



TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) system

The TNM stages of SCLC range from stage
0 to stage 4. The more serious the cancer
growth and spread, the higher the stage.
Stage 0 cancers are only in the airways and
are very rare.

What is the VA staging
system?

Stage 1

The VA Lung Study Group created the first
staging system for SCLC. It has been used in
studies on treatment. The system divides lung
cancer into 2 stages:


Limited stage



Extensive stage

Stage 1 cancers consist of one small lung
tumor and have not spread to other body parts.
Stage 1A tumors are 3 centimeters (cm, a little
over 1 inch, or the size of a grape) or smaller.
Stage 1B tumors are larger but don’t exceed 4
cm (roughly an inch and a half, or the size of a
walnut).

Stage 2

Limited-stage cancer is found on one side of
the chest and can be treated with radiation
therapy. The cancer is contained in an area
that would fit within one radiation field.

Stage 2A cancers are like stage 1 cancers
except larger (up to 5 cm, just about 2 inches,
the size of a lime). Stage 2B cancers are
larger (up to 7 cm, about 2.75 inches, the size
of a peach), have started to invade other body
parts, or have multiple tumors in one lobe.
Other 2B cancers consist of one lung tumor
that is no larger than 5 cm and has spread to
lymph nodes inside the lung.

With modern radiation treatment techniques,
the definition of limited-stage disease has been
expanded to include some cases that are on
both sides of the chest as long as they can be
safely treated with radiation.
Most people with SCLC have extensive stage.
Extensive-stage cancer can’t be treated within
one radiation field with the intent to cure the
cancer. It has spread too much.

Stage 3
Stage 3 is a mixed group of locally advanced
cancers. They are further grouped as stages
3A, 3B, or 3C. Many of these cancers include:

For example, it may have spread to the other
side of the chest, to the fluid around the lungs
or heart, or outside the chest.

A lung tumor that has markedly invaded
other tissue
Lung tumors in multiple lobes of the lung

2 Lung cancer staging » How does NCCN stage SCLC? » Key points



Key points

Cancer spread to lymph nodes between
the lungs, in the other lung, or near the
collarbone



Stage 4
The cancer has spread far from the main
tumor. Stage 4A cancer has spread far within
the chest or to only one place outside the
chest. Stage 4B cancer has spread to at least
two places outside the chest.





How does NCCN stage
SCLC?



Most research studies on lung cancer
treatment have used the VA system. The
benefit of the TNM system is that it better
identifies when local therapy—surgery or
radiation—can be safely used. NCCN lung
cancer experts use a combined staging
approach to account for these factors.




Limited stage includes cancers that are
stages 1 to 3 and can be treated with
radiation and chemotherapy.
Extensive stage includes any cancers,
including stage 4, that can’t be treated
with high radiation doses intended to
cure.

Until the TNM system is more widely used
in research studies, the best approach is a
combined staging system. Cancer staging in
the following chapters refers to this combined
system.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Small Cell Lung Cancer, 2024

13

A cancer staging system is a standard
way of grouping cancers by their growth
and spread. Staging the cancer is needed
before treatment.
The VA (Veterans Administration) staging
system groups cancers into either limited
stage or extensive stage. It has been
used the most in research studies on
treatment of lung cancer.
The TNM (tumor, node, metastasis)
system groups cancers into stage 0, 1,
2, 3, or 4. This system allows for more
precise treatment planning.
NCCN experts of small cell lung cancer
(SCLC) use a combined staging
approach. Limited-stage cancers include
stages 1 to 3, which can be treated
with radiation therapy. Extensive-stage
cancers, such as stage 4, can’t be treated
with high radiation doses intended to
cure.

health care providers need to know about
them.

order several tests to plan your
treatment. Some tests assess your
general health. Other tests assess
the cancer. This chapter explains
the tests in detail.

Physical exam
After taking your health history, your health
care provider will perform a physical exam.
An exam is done to find signs of disease and
decide which treatments may be options.
During this exam, expect the following to be
checked:

Health history and exams
Your cancer care providers need to have all
your health information. One of the first steps
is obtaining a complete report of your health
called a medical history. Read Guide 2 on
page 16 for a full list of tests that are used to
plan treatment.

Medical history
Your health care providers will ask about any
health problems and treatments you’ve had.
When you meet with your cancer health care
providers, be ready to talk about:


Illnesses



Injuries



Health conditions



Symptoms



Medications

Your body temperature



Your blood pressure



Your pulse and breathing rate



Your weight



How your lungs, heart, and gut sound





How your eyes, skin, nose, ears, and
mouth look
Level of pain when you are touched

Performance status
Your health care providers will assess how well
you can do day-to-day activities—like working,
walking, or taking a shower. Your ability to do
these activities is called a performance status.

Bring a list of old and new medications and
any over-the-counter medicines, herbals, or
supplements you take.

The more activities you can do, the better your
performance status. Your health care providers
will use your performance status to assess if
you can undergo certain treatments.

Performance status is often measured on a
scale that ranges from 0 to 5. Lower scores
mean better performance status.

“

Blood tests
Blood tests measure blood cells, proteins, and
chemicals in the bloodstream. Your health care
providers will use these tests to assess your
general health and if the cancer may have
spread. They will plan other tests and cancer
treatment based on test results.

Ask as many questions as possible
and bring a family member with
you to appointments."

A blood draw removes a sample of blood for
testing. It is done with a needle inserted into a
vein. The following tests are needed:










Pulmonary function tests

A complete blood count (CBC) measures
parts of the blood, including counts of
white blood cells, red blood cells, and
platelets.

To receive some treatments, your lungs have
to work fairly well. Pulmonary function tests
show how well lungs work.


Electrolytes are minerals in the blood.
They include sodium, calcium, and
potassium. Organs, such as your bones,
need electrolytes to work well.



Liver function tests measure chemicals
made or processed by the liver.
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is waste made
by your body after you eat. Too much
BUN in blood could be a sign of kidney
damage.
Creatinine is waste made by muscles. Too
much creatinine in blood could be a sign
of kidney damage.

Spirometry involves blowing into a tube to
measure how much air you breathe and
how fast you breathe.
A gas diffusion test involves breathing in
a harmless gas and measuring how much
you breathe out. It tells how much oxygen
travels from your lungs into your blood.

into the scanning machine. At least part of your
body will be in the machine.

Imaging makes pictures of the insides of your
body. It can show cancer in deep tissue, lymph
nodes, or distant body parts outside of the
lung. Imaging is helpful for cancer staging and
treatment planning.

A radiologist is a health care provider who’s an
expert in reading images. They’ll convey the
test results to your care team.

CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis

An injection of a contrast agent is sometimes
used to make the pictures clearer. Contrast
should not be used if you may be allergic to it.
During imaging, you’ll lie on a table that slides

Imaging
Imaging is used to make painless pictures of the insides of your body. You will lie on a
table that will move into the tunnel of the machine. You will need to lie still during the
scan. You may be asked to hold your breath. The scan is quick. The pictures will be
viewed on a computer by a doctor who will look for signs of cancer.

different angles using x-rays. Contrast will be
used. A computer combines the pictures to
make a 3D image.

Brain imaging

We want your
feedback!

MRI can detect small tumors in the brain. It
uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make
pictures. Contrast will be used. If MRI can’t be
done, you may get a CT with contrast of your
head.

Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.

PET/CT from skull base to knees

Take our survey to let us know
what we got right and what we
could do better.

PET scans use a special camera that detects
an injected radioactive sugar. Cancer cells
quickly use the sugar. Combining PET with CT
may detect small cancers that can’t be found
by CT alone.

NCCN.org/patients/feedback

Your health care provider may order PET/
CT to clarify or check CT results. The scan
will extend from the base of your skull to your
knees. If PET/CT can’t be done, you may get a
bone scan.

Bone imaging
If initial imaging suggests a limited-stage
cancer, you may undergo bone imaging.
X-rays or MRI may be used. If this imaging
doesn’t detect cancer, you may need a bone
biopsy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Small Cell Lung Cancer, 2024

3 Tests for lung cancer » Biopsies

Biopsies

Lymph node biopsy
The space between your lungs is called the
mediastinum. This space has many diseasefighting clumps of tissue called lymph nodes.
Lung cancer tends to spread from inside the
lung to these nodes.

If imaging suggests that you may have SCLC,
your health care provider will order more tests
for further staging. Your health care providers
need to know the correct cancer stage for
treatment planning.

If stage 1 or 2A cancer may be treated with
surgery, a biopsy of mediastinal nodes
is needed. The biopsy is used to confirm
that there is no cancer in these lymph
nodes. These nodes may be biopsied
by mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy,
endobronchial or esophageal ultrasoundguided biopsy, or VATS.

Pleural fluid biopsy
The lungs are covered by two layers of tissue
called pleura. There is fluid between the two
layers. Some people with lung cancer have
an excess of this fluid, which is called pleural
effusion.
If you have pleural effusion, a biopsy
is needed. A needle biopsy, called a
thoracentesis, may be used to remove
some of the fluid for testing. If results are
unclear, a thoracoscopy may be done next. A
thoracoscopy involves making small openings
called ports into your chest. Small tools are
inserted through the ports to remove tissue.
Thoracoscopy is also called video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

Bone marrow biopsy
Most bones have a soft center called marrow.
Your blood tests may suggest that the cancer
has spread to your bone marrow. In this case,
tests of bone marrow are needed.
There are two methods of removing bone
marrow, which may be done at the same time.




A bone marrow biopsy removes a core of
bone and soft bone marrow.
A bone marrow aspiration removes liquid
bone marrow.

Staging biopsies for limited-stage cancer
If the cancer may be limited stage, a biopsy may be needed. The biopsy will confirm
that the cancer has not spread outside the lung. The image on the top shows a biopsy
of bone and bone marrow. The image on the bottom shows a procedure called an
endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy. Tissue can be removed with the scoping tool
that is guided down the throat.

Cancer cell tests

Ask for a copy of the pathology reports. Your
health care providers will review the results
with you. Take notes and ask questions. Your
health care providers will use the reports to
plan your treatment.

Body tissue that is removed during biopsy
or surgery will be sent to a lab for testing. A
pathologist will examine and test the samples.
Pathologists are health care providers who
are experts in tissue and cells and diagnosing
cancer.

Pathology review
Pathologists study tissue with a microscope to
classify the disease. This is called histologic
typing. The pathologist will write the results in
a report. The pathology report will state if the
cancer started in the lung or elsewhere. If the
cancer started in the lung, the report will also
list the type of lung cancer.
Pathologists study tissue for cancer staging.
Before treatment, you may have tissue
samples removed other than the lung tumor.
An example is lymph nodes. Lymph nodes
are also removed during surgical treatment.
The pathologist will study the tissue for cancer
cells. Health care providers use pathology
results to stage the cancer.
Pathologists study tissue to assess treatment
results. If you have surgery for treatment, the
pathologist will study the edge of the removed
tissue for cancer cells. Health care providers
use the pathology results to plan the next
steps of treatment.
All pathology reports will be sent to your
cancer health care providers. Before
treatment, you may have tissue samples

CT and MRI scans are first used to look
for cancer spread. PET/CT may help
detect cancer not found by CT alone. If
cancer isn’t detected in bone by initial
imaging, you may get x-rays or MRI of
bones.
If imaging doesn’t detect cancer outside
the lungs, you may get biopsies of pleural
fluid, bone marrow, or lymph nodes
between the lungs.
For limited-stage cancer, your lungs will
be tested to assess if surgery or radiation
therapy are options.

chapter are right for you.



Advances in treatment
The classic treatment for small cell lung cancer
(SCLC) is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is
a type of whole-body (systemic) therapy. It
travels in the bloodstream to cancer cells. It
works by stopping cancer cells from making
more cancer cells.



Systemic therapy
Systemic therapy for lung cancer
includes chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. Most often,
chemotherapy is a liquid that is
slowly injected into a vein, called
an infusion, but sometimes it is a
pill. Immunotherapy is only given
by infusion. Systemic therapy is
given in cycles of treatment days
followed by rest days. Cycles give
your body a chance to recover
after receiving treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Small Cell Lung Cancer, 2024

Limited stage includes cancers that are
stage 1 to 3 and can be treated with
radiation and chemotherapy with a goal of
curing the disease.
Extensive stage includes any cancers,
including stage 4, that can’t be treated
with high radiation doses, but can
be treated with chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. Radiation in this stage
can't cure the cancer.

4 Initial treatment » Advances in treatment

“

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays
to treat lung cancer. It damages cancer cells.
The cancer cells either die or stop making
new cancer cells. Radiation therapy is a local
treatment. Modern techniques shape the
radiation dose to the tumor to spare healthy
tissue.

Your medical team is your greatest
asset and friend(s), especially the
nurses. They are all highly skilled
and sincerely dedicated to help you
however they can."

Radiation therapy has a role in all stages
of lung cancer. It is mainly used to attempt
to cure limited-stage cancer, and to reduce
certain symptoms caused by extensive-stage
cancer. Surgery is another local treatment
used to cure some limited-stage cancers.

New treatments
Treatment of extensive-stage cancer has
improved in recent years. One advance is the
addition of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is
a systemic therapy like chemotherapy. It uses
the body’s defense against disease, called the
immune system, to kill cancer cells.

Radiation therapy
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
is the most common method used
for treatment. A large machine makes
radiation beams that are shaped to the
form of the tumor. The highest radiation
dose is aimed at the cancer. A much
lower dose is given to nearby tissue.
You will not feel anything during the
treatment session. Treatment does not
make you radioactive.

and etoposide. Immunotherapy has been
recently found to be useful after the initial
chemoradiation treatment has been delivered.

The goal of initial treatment for limited-stage
cancer is to cure the cancer. Chemotherapy
is often used with local treatment. Options for
initial treatment of limited-stage cancer are
listed in Guide 3.

Chemoradiation
Most limited-stage cancers are treated with
both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This
combined treatment is called chemoradiation.

Most people receive 4 cycles of chemotherapy.
There are typically 21 to 28 days in a cycle.
Limited-stage cancer is treated with either
cisplatin and etoposide or carboplatin

Concurrent chemoradiation is the use of
both treatments at the same time. Radiation
therapy should be started during the first or

chemoradiation is the use of one treatment
followed by the other. There are advantages
and disadvantages and you will have a
conversation about the risks and benefits of
each approach.

Lower performance scores represent a better
ability to do self-care. Chemoradiation may not
be an option when scores are high.

Surgery
Some people with limited stage 1 or 2A may
be able to have surgery. There must be no
cancer in the biopsy samples of the lymph
nodes between the lungs. The lung tumor
is often removed during a surgery called a
lobectomy. If cancer is only in one lobe of the

Performance status is your ability to do dayto-day activities. Diseases like cancer can limit
what you can do. Health care providers use
performance status to decide which treatments
may be safe for you.

Lobectomy
Lobectomy is a type of surgery that removes an entire lobe of the lung. The surgery
can be done with one of two methods. The classic method is thoracotomy. This
surgery removes tissue through a large opening in the chest.
Thoracoscopy is a newer method. A small camera and surgical tools are inserted
through small openings. Thoracoscopy can be done with or without help from a robot.
Thoracoscopy is also called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

lungs, a lobectomy removes an entire lobe of
the lung.

Please allow yourself to accept
hard days, difficult moments, or
disappointments. Speaking with
a behavioral health specialist can
help you prepare for the emotional
changes that you may face."

During surgery, lymph nodes will also be
removed to test them for cancer. A lymph
node sampling removes some nodes in and
between the lungs.
A lymph node dissection removes as many
nodes as possible from the lung and between
the lungs.
Some hard-to-detect cancer cells are almost
always left behind even after surgery. So you
will receive chemotherapy after surgery to treat
any remaining cancer cells. Treatment for this
purpose is called adjuvant therapy.
Radiation therapy to the chest may also be
received at the same time or back-to-back. It
may improve results if cancer is in mediastinal
lymph nodes.

SABR
Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR)
may be an option for people who don’t have
surgery. SABR is also called stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT).
SABR delivers a high radiation dose to a
precise area. Afterward, you will receive
systemic therapy to treat any remaining cancer
cells. Treatment for this purpose is called
adjuvant therapy.

inhibitors enable immune cells called T cells to
attack cancer cells.
After chemoimmunotherapy, you may stay on
the checkpoint inhibitor if treatment results
show the tumor is stable/not getting worse,
not growing, and has not spread. This is
called maintenance. The goal of maintenance
treatment is to prolong good treatment results.

The goals of treatment for extensive-stage
cancer are to control symptoms and to prolong
life. Systemic therapy is the main treatment.
You will likely receive four 21-day cycles of
chemoimmunotherapy, but some people
receive up to six cycles. This is often followed
by immunotherapy alone.



Options for initial systemic therapy of
extensive-stage cancer are listed in Guide 4.

Chemoimmunotherapy
The preferred treatment for extensive-stage
cancer is chemoimmunotherapy. Platinumdoublet chemotherapy is given with an
immunotherapy medicine called an immune

used with CT. If the cancer worsens, radiation
therapy of the brain will be started.

Autoimmune diseases include Crohn’s
disease, ulcerative colitis, and lupus. When
immunotherapy is not an option, you may
receive only chemotherapy.

What are the techniques of EBRT?
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the
most common radiaiton treatment method for
SCLC. It may be delivered by one of several
techniques:

Radiation therapy



In addition to systemic therapy, you may
get radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can
reduce (palliate) symptoms caused by lung
cancer, such as:






Swelling caused by the cancer blocking a
vein called the superior vena cava


Bone pain due to the cancer damaging
bone
Back pain from the cancer pressing on
the spinal cord

Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)
delivers IMRT in an arc shape around the
tumor.
Three-dimensional conformal radiation
therapy (3D-CRT) delivers an x-ray beam
that matches the shape of the target but
may not be as focused as IMRT.

Cancer treatment with IMRT, VMAT, and
3D-CRT is typically delivered daily Monday
through Friday and finishes in about 6 weeks.
Radiation therapy for symptoms is finished
in 10 or fewer sessions. Newer techniques
for small tumors are also finished in a shorter
amount of time:

Trouble breathing due to the cancer
blocking airways
Headaches from lung cancer in the brain

Treatment of the brain usually involves
radiation to the entire brain, which is called
whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT).



Some people can receive a high radiation dose
just to the affected area of the brain.


When lung cancer has spread to the brain,
radiation therapy is sometimes received before
it causes symptoms.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treats
small tumors with very precise, high-dose
x-ray beams.
When SRS is used to treat tumors not in
the brain or spine, it is called stereotactic
ablative radiotherapy (SABR).

SRS is finished in one or a few sessions.
SABR is given two to three times per week.
Treatment is finished in about 1½ weeks.

During systemic therapy, your health care
provider will assess the status of the cancer.
After every 2 cycles, you will get either MRI
or CT scans of the brain. Contrast should be

Treatment response



A treatment response is how well someone
improves with treatment and how much the
cancer shrinks. Many SCLCs respond strongly
to initial treatment. The timing of assessing the
treatment response differs between treatment
types and the cancer stage.

Additional radiation therapy
After treatment response is assessed, you may
receive radiation therapy. Prophylactic cranial
irradiation (PCI) is an option for limited- and
extensive-stage cancer.

For limited-stage cancer, the treatment
response should be assessed:

There are 4 possible treatment responses:








Complete remission is the most effective
result. There are no signs of cancer.
Partial remission means that the tumors
have shrunk, and blood results are
returning to normal.

A complete or partial remission of cancer
was achieved.
There are no signs or symptoms of lung
cancer in the brain.
You do not have problems with things like
your memory.
Your health doesn’t largely limit your dayto-day activities.

For some limited-stage cancers, PCI can
prevent lung cancer tumors in the brain and
prolong life. For extensive-stage cancer, PCI
can prevent or delay lung cancer from forming
tumors in the brain.

Stable disease is less than a partial
remission. The cancer is not getting
worse.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Progressive disease is the cancer getting
worse. Treatment options for progressive
disease are the same as for relapse listed
in Chapter 5.

4 Initial treatment » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
in order to compare how they respond to a
specific treatment.

Therapy may also be available as part of a
clinical trial. A clinical trial is a type of medical
research study and a vital way to assess new
treatment methods.
After being developed and tested in a
laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may be
approved by the FDA.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is
also provided in an informed consent form.
This agreement confirms that you’ve been fully
told about your part in the trial. Read the form
carefully and ask questions before signing it.
Take time to discuss with family, friends, or
others whom you trust. Keep in mind that you
can leave and seek treatment outside of the
clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your health care provider
about whether a clinical trial may make sense
for you.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.








Start the conversation

Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.

Don’t wait for your health care provider to bring
up clinical trials. Start the conversation and
learn about all of your treatment options. Ask
if a clinical trial is available for your situation.
If you find a study that you may be eligible
for, ask your treatment team if you meet the
requirements. If you have already started
standard treatment, you may not be eligible for
certain clinical trials. Try not to be discouraged
if you cannot join. New clinical trials are always
becoming available.

Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Finding a clinical trial

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It’s common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You’ll be informed if a
placebo is part of a clinical trial before you
enroll.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
There’s no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or childcare due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you’ll
continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You’re responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that aren’t covered by
your insurance.

on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Your health care provider will order a CT, a
machine that you lie inside that takes many
x-rays at once. It may detect a relapse. CT of
your chest, abdomen, and, sometimes, pelvis
may be done every 2 to 6 months. If a new
lung nodule is detected, more testing will be
needed to confirm if it is cancer.
An MRI (another machine you lie inside that
takes pictures using magnets) may show small
brain tumors that aren’t causing symptoms.
Contrast, a liquid injected into your vein that
shows blood vessels better, should be used.

Healthy living

If MRI can’t be done, you may get a CT with
contrast of your head. Brain MRI or CT of the
head should be done every 3 to 4 months
during the first year after treatment. During
the second year, this imaging should be done
every 6 months.

Another part of follow-up care is to prevent
diseases. Such care can include getting
immunization shots for the flu, herpes,
shingles, and other diseases. Dental cleaning
and regular exams can prevent disease, too.
Other common goals for healthy living include:

you received for your initial treatment. So if
chemotherapy was your initial treatment, you
can have that chemotherapy again to treat a
SCLC relapse.



Other options are chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)
and nivolumab (Opdivo) are immune
checkpoint inhibitors.
If treatment may do more harm than good,
supportive care is an option. Supportive care
aims to improve quality of life. It’s also called
palliative care. Supportive care may include
radiation therapy for the relief of symptoms.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Small Cell Lung Cancer, 2024

Your cancer care providers will monitor for
a return of lung cancer. Regular testing for
cancer relapse is called surveillance.
Some side effects of treatment are longterm or may appear years later.
Tell your care team about any new or
worse symptoms. There are ways to
prevent or treat most side effects.
If you have a high risk for certain cancers,
you may enroll in a screening program.
Treatment for a relapse includes
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and
clinical trials. If treatment may do more
harm than good, supportive care to
improve your quality of life is an option.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer should not be
ignored, there is time to have another care
provider review your test results and suggest a
treatment plan. This is called getting a second
opinion, and it’s a normal part of cancer care.
Even doctors get second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your team.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:




What you want and how that might differ
from what others want

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Your religious and spiritual beliefs

Support groups



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.
