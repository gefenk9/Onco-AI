About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, Version
1.2024 — December 7, 2023.

While most side effects of CAR

The first 4 therapies listed bind to a protein
called CD19. They are used to treat B-cell
leukemias and lymphomas. The last 2 products
listed target B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA).
They are used to treat multiple myeloma, a
cancer of plasma cells.

T-cell therapy can be managed
with expert care and improve over
time, some side effects may be
severe or life-threatening.

Serious side effects
A common, serious side effect of CAR T is
cytokine release syndrome (CRS). In CRS,
inflammation-causing proteins appear in the
bloodstream, causing the immune system to
go into overdrive.

What is CAR T-cell therapy?
CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy.
Immunotherapy uses the immune system to
fight cancer. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
T-cell therapy works by changing your own
immune cells in a way that allows them to find
and kill cancer cells.

The other main side effect of CAR T is a range
of problems affecting the brain and nervous
system. Together this group of symptoms is
called neurotoxicity. Immune effector cellassociated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)
is a way to describe some but not all of these
effects.

CAR T is currently used to treat certain
blood cancers that did not respond to other
treatment, or that have come back after
treatment. This includes some forms of
lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma.

Another possible side effect is Immune
Effector Cell-Associated Hemophagocytic
Lymphohistiocytosis-Like Syndrome (IEC-HS).
Until recently, this syndrome was thought to be
part of CRS. Now it is considered a separate
condition. In IEC-HS, immune messengers
called cytokines are over-produced, leading
to organ damage. It tends to occur in people
who have already had treatment for CRS.
Signs and symptoms include high ferritin (iron)
levels, low blood cell counts, blood clotting
problems, high liver enzyme levels, and organ
failure.

CAR T products
At this time there are 6 CAR T-cell therapies
approved by the U.S. Food & Drug
Administration (FDA) for cancer treatment:


Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah)



Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta)

The FDA requires that makers of drugs or
cell therapy products with very serious risks
develop a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategy (REMS). The purpose is to ensure
that the benefits of a drug outweigh its

to a lab. There they are modified by adding
a gene to produce a receptor called chimeric

Heart check

“search and destroy” approach. CAR T cells
are one type of immune effector cell (IEC).

CAR T-cell therapy can cause changes
in heartbeat and other problems. Before
receiving CAR T, your doctor will want to
check your heart. This will provide a baseline
(starting) picture of its structure and function.
A heart ultrasound (echocardiogram) is often
ordered. This noninvasive test is performed
using a handheld wand placed on your chest.
It does not use radiation. If you have a history
of heart problems, your doctor will consult with
a heart expert (cardiologist).

Before and during infusion
Central venous access
CAR T products are given intravenously.
This means they are put directly into the
bloodstream through a vein. A type of catheter
called a central venous catheter is often
used when long-term (weeks or months) vein
access is needed. A thin tube is inserted into
your vein, usually below the collarbone or in
the upper arm. The tube is guided into a large
vein above the right side of the heart. When
needed, this catheter will be accessed to draw
blood, give fluids or medicines, or administer
CAR T-cell therapy.

Neurologic (neuro) exam
CAR T-cell therapy can cause brain and
nervous system problems. Expect to have a
neurologic (“neuro”) exam before receiving
your cells. Neurologic means having to do
with the nervous system. This check provides
a point of comparison for testing done after
infusion.

Echocardiogram
CAR T can cause heart problems.
It is important for your doctor to
know how your heart looks and
works before you receive CAR T
cells. An echocardiogram ("echo")
is often ordered. It is a painless
ultrasound of the heart.

Preventing seizures

The extent of the exam will vary between
providers. At a minimum, the exam will check
your level of awareness and ability to interact
with your surroundings. The Immune Effector
Cell-Associated Encephalopathy (ICE)
Assessment Tool is often used. This screening
test measures your ability to carry out simple
tasks, such as writing and counting. Other
tests and tools may be used to check your:


Motor (movement) and sensory skills



Balance and coordination



Reflexes



Nerve function

Some CAR T therapies are more likely to
affect the brain than others. On the day of
infusion, or anytime after, your doctor may
start you on a medication to prevent seizures.
A drug called levetiracetam is often given.
It is an anticonvulsant. Anticonvulsants
reduce abnormal overactivity in the brain.
Levetiracetam is usually taken as a pill every
12 hours for up to 30 days.

Your doctor may also order magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain. This
can be helpful to compare with brain images
taken if neurotoxicity develops after infusion.

Tumor lysis syndrome
Cancer cells break apart when they die.
The contents of the dead cells enter the
bloodstream. They disrupt the chemical
balance of the blood. This is called tumor lysis
syndrome (TLS). It is a serious potential side
effect of cancer treatment. It can lead to organ
damage and be life-threatening. TLS most
often occurs after treatment of large tumors
or fast-growing cancers. If this applies to your
cancer, your doctor will take steps to prevent
TLS. You will be monitored closely.

Growth factors

Low numbers of B cells
CAR T-cell therapy is most often used to treat
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In the process
of killing cancer cells, normal B cells are also
destroyed. Absence of B cells is called B-cell
aplasia. It is a common side effect of CAR T.
Depending on the type of CAR T received, it
may last a long time. Having too few B cells
can mean that the CAR T cells continue to
fight the cancer. But it also means that you
have fewer immune cells to protect you from
infection.

Ferritin (a protein that stores iron for the
body to use)

After leaving the hospital, you will continue to
be closely monitored for side effects. Expect to
be watched closely for at least 4 weeks after
infusion, and possibly up to 6 months. This will
depend on the CAR T product you received.
Your care team will instruct you not to drive or
do anything else potentially dangerous for at
least 8 weeks after infusion.

Preventing infections
Medications to prevent certain infections is
recommended for at least 3 to 6 months after
CAR T. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia
is a fungal infection of the lungs. It can be
prevented by taking an oral antibiotic. The
varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox

Growth factors are medications that drive bone
marrow to make more blood cells. They are
given by injection or intravenously. Colonystimulating growth factors such as filgrastim
can also help your body make more white
blood cells.

You will have ongoing blood testing while in the
hospital. Testing will look for any deficiencies
or problems. Blood tests you are likely to have
include:
Complete blood count (CBC)

Blood and platelet transfusions

Blood transfusions can raise the levels of red
blood cells or platelets. In a transfusion, cells
donated by healthy volunteers are put into your
bloodstream through a vein.

If hospital (inpatient) care is not needed, close
monitoring by a center with CAR T experience
may be an option. At the first sign of CRS or
neurologic toxicity, hospitalization is needed.

Some people will have frequent infusions
of a particular therapy called intravenous
immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG). The antibodies
used for the IVIG infusions come from different
people. These donated antibodies help
strengthen your immune system and fight
infection. IVIG is typically only given if you are
getting serious or repeated infections.

severe.

What is CRS?
Cytokines are proteins. They carry out different
immune-related jobs in the body. Some types
cause inflammation. Other types help to
reduce it.

Serious CRS problems

In the days after a CAR T infusion, immune
cells affected by the treatment may release
many inflammation-causing cytokines into
the blood. This causes your immune system
to go into overdrive. A number of signs and
symptoms are possible as a result. They
include:

Low blood pressure



Fever



Low blood pressure



Low tissue oxygen level

Muscle and joint aches

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Immunotherapy Side Effects: CAR T-Cell Therapy, 2024

CRS is mild for most people, but serious and
possibly deadly problems are possible. These
are described next.

Blood pressure is the strength of blood
pushing against the sides of blood vessels.
CRS can cause blood pressure to drop. Low
blood pressure (hypotension) is dangerous.
It reduces blood flow to the heart, brain, and
other vital organs. In severe cases, low blood
pressure can be life-threatening. Severely low
blood pressure is treated with vasopressors.
These medicines raise blood pressure by
contracting (tightening) blood vessels.

Lack of oxygen to tissues
Hypoxia is a dangerous condition. It happens
when there is not enough oxygen reaching the
cells and tissues of the body. The brain, liver,
and other organs can be damaged in minutes
if they do not get enough oxygen.

12

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) » How severe is it?

Capillary leak syndrome

Oxygen therapy is used to make sure that your
tissues and organs are getting enough oxygen.
Oxygen may be given through noninvasive
nose tubes or a mask that covers your nose
and mouth. The method used to give oxygen
will depend on how low the level is.

This syndrome is a condition in which fluid and
proteins leak out of the bloodstream. They leak
out through tiny blood vessels (capillaries). It
can lead to dangerously low blood pressure,
organ failure, and shock. Shock is a lifethreatening problem. It occurs when there is a
sudden drop in blood flow in the body.

In severe cases, intubation may be needed.
Intubation refers to putting a tube through
the mouth and into the airway. The tube is
connected to a respirator that moves air in and
out of your lungs. This is called mechanical
ventilation.

How severe is it?
Doctors use a grading system to assign CRS a
grade from 1 (mildest) to 4 (most severe). The
grade helps guide treatment decisions.

Effects on the heart
CRS can cause changes in the way the
heart beats. It may beat faster, slower, or at
abnormal intervals. Atrial fibrillation (“A-fib”)
refers to a fast and irregular heartbeat. In
ventricular tachycardia (“V-tach”) the heart
beats quickly but regularly. Changes in
heartbeat like these can be dangerous. Extra
medications and other treatments may be
needed.









CRS can also cause your heart to not work
as well. This is often temporary. While
uncommon, the heart can also suddenly stop
working after CAR T. This is called cardiac
arrest. It causes you to stop breathing and
pass out. It can be life threatening, but this is
very rare.

Poor kidney function
The kidneys filter waste from the blood. CRS
can cause the kidneys to suddenly stop
filtering blood. This is called acute kidney injury
(AKI). It is not common. If it occurs, the effects
are usually reversible (not permanent).

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) » Treatment

Treatment
Tocilizumab (Actemra)
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine released
during CRS. This leads to very high levels of
it in the blood. Tocilizumab is a prescription
medicine that blocks interaction between IL-6
and its receptors. Intravenous tocilizumab is
essential for treating moderate to severe CRS
(grades 2, 3, and 4).

It is also used to treat milder (grade 1) CRS
in certain cases. It may be given for mild CRS
lasting longer than 3 days (or less, depending
on the specific CAR T therapy). It may also be
given to treat mild CRS in the elderly, those
with nervous system symptoms, and/or other
health problems.

NCCN.org/patients/response

Steroids
Corticosteroids (steroids for short) are drugs
that reduce the activity of the immune system.
They are not the same as steroids used to
build muscle mass (anabolic steroids).
Intravenous steroids are used together with
tocilizumab to treat more severe CRS, and
sometimes milder CRS. They are also used
to treat more severe neurologic side effects.
Dexamethasone and methylprednisolone are
commonly used steroids.

Anakinra (Kineret)
For severe CRS that does not improve with
tocilizumab and high-dose steroids, treatment
with anakinra (Kineret) may be considered. It is
given as an injection under the skin. Anakinra
blocks the activity of interleukin-1, a cytokine
that causes inflammation.

In more severe cases, seizures, brain
swelling, and coma can occur. These may
be life-threatening. These and other possible
symptoms are described below.

The brain, the spinal cord, and nerves make
up the nervous system. This complex system
controls everything the body does. Movement,
sensation, and breathing are all guided by
the nervous system. It is the hub of all things
mental including thought, memory, and
learning.

Nervous system side effects, if they occur,
typically start 4 to 10 days after treatment.
They tend to last about 2 weeks but can last as
long as 4 to 8 weeks.

Doctors call nervous system side effects,
including those caused by immunotherapy,
"neurotoxicity." Immune effector cellassociated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)
is a term used to describe some but not all of
these effects. Immune effector cell (IEC) is
another term for a CAR T cell.

Delirium
Delirium is a sudden change in brain function.
It causes confusion, disorientation, and
changes in behavior or emotions. It can also
cause agitation and hallucinations (seeing
things that aren’t there). Delirium comes on
quickly, often in a matter of hours to days.

Nerve problems
Your autonomic nervous system is always
working behind the scenes. It regulates your
basic body functions. This includes your heart
rate, digestion, breathing rate, and body
temperature. ICANS can cause this system

to not work as well. This causes symptoms
such as dizziness upon standing up, sweating
too much or too little, and bowel and bladder
problems.

The uncommon but serious nervous system
side effects of CAR T-cell therapy are
described next.

Language problems

Seizures

Aphasia is the loss of ability to understand or
express speech. It is caused by injury to the
brain. Aphasia is a language disorder–it does
not affect intelligence. People with aphasia
are still able to formulate thoughts in the same
way. They are just unable to express them as
they did before. This can be very frustrating.
Aphasia typically only lasts a few hours or
days.

Abnormal electrical signals in the brain
can cause sudden and uncontrolled body
movements. Shaking in particular is common.
These are called seizures. Other symptoms
include behavior changes, loss of awareness,
and loss of muscle control.
Status epilepticus is the medical term for
having one long (5 minutes or more) seizure,
or several shorter seizures in a row. This is a
medical emergency that can occur in severe
ICANS. Hospital treatment typically includes
use of several different types of drugs.

Monitoring for seizures
You may have
electroencephalography (EEG) to
monitor for seizures during ICANS.
An EEG is a recording of electrical
activity in the brain.

Nervous system side effects » Anti-BCMA CAR T side effects

Anti-BCMA CAR T side
effects

Brain swelling
Swelling due to trapped fluid is the body’s
response to many types of injury and illness.
Swelling of the brain is a life-threatening
reaction to CAR T. When the brain swells, it
increases the pressure inside the skull.

The CAR T products listed below target B-cell
maturation antigen (BCMA). They are used to
treat multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma
cells.

Medicines are used to draw fluid out of
the skull and injured brain. This is called
osmotic therapy or hyperosmolar therapy.
In severe cases of brain swelling, a
lumbar puncture (described on the next
page) or ventriculostomy may be needed.
Ventriculostomy is a procedure that involves
inserting a plastic tube into the skull. Excess
fluid drains through the tube in order to lower
the pressure.

Anti-BCMA products can cause nervous
system side effects that are not considered
part of ICANS. Compared to ICANS, these
effects start late. Symptoms can start between
10 and 110 days after infusion.

MNTs
Movement and neurocognitive treatmentemergent adverse events (MNTs) cause
symptoms that are similar to those caused by
Parkinson’s disease. Symptoms include:


Slowness of movement (bradykinesia)

Weak voice (hypophonia)



Personality changes

Impaired memory



Trouble balancing (postural instability)

For mild symptoms, your doctor may prescribe
an oral steroid. If you have severe or persistent
symptoms and a high level of CAR T cells in
your blood, chemotherapy may be given to
reduce the number of CAR T cells.

“IV drip”) to keep you hydrated. Your care
team will also take steps to prevent food or
liquid from going into your airway instead of
your food pipe (esophagus). Food or fluids
in the airway is called aspiration. It can lead
to infection (often pneumonia) and inflamed
lungs.

Muscle weakness or paralysis (if motor
nerves are affected)

For mild symptoms, your doctor will consider
treatment with steroids.

Monitoring for seizures

Acute inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy (AIDP) is a rare and severe
peripheral nerve problem. It causes weakness
that often starts in the feet and works its way
up the body, eventually affecting all 4 limbs. If
your symptoms suggest AIDP, your doctor will
consider intravenous immunoglobulin therapy
(IVIG).

You may be monitored for seizures. An
electroencephalogram (EEG) is used. An EEG
is a recording of electrical activity in the brain.
It tracks and records brain wave patterns. The
patterns are relayed by small metal sensors
placed on your scalp.

Brain imaging
You may have magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) of your brain to look for swelling or
damage. If MRI is not possible, you may have
computed tomography (CT) instead.

Lumbar puncture
A lumbar puncture may be needed for more
severe ICANS. The fluid that flows in and
around the brain and spinal cord is called
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Lumbar puncture
is a simple bedside procedure to remove a
sample of spinal fluid for testing. It can also
be used to measure and relieve pressure from
brain swelling.

Lumbar puncture
A lumbar puncture may
be needed if ICANS
becomes severe. It
involves removing spinal
fluid for testing.

How severe is it?

Treatment

Doctors use a point system to assign ICANS
a grade from 1 to 4. A score of 4 is the most
severe (life threatening). The grade helps
guide treatment decisions.

For mild ICANS, supportive care is often all
that is needed. Moderate or severe ICANS
is treated with steroids given through a
vein. Steroids are medicines that reduce
immune system activity. They relieve
inflammation in the body. Dexamethasone and
methylprednisolone are widely used steroids.

One key factor in the overall grade is
the Immune Effector Cell-Associated
Encephalopathy (ICE) score. The ICE
Assessment Tool is an ICANS screening test.
It provides a snapshot of your mental state. It
measures your ability to carry out simple tasks,
such as writing and counting. A score of 0
(critical emergency) to 10 (mild) is possible.

For severe ICANS that is not improving with
high-dose steroids, treatment with anakinra
may be added.
Those with both ICANS (any grade) and
cytokine release syndrome will also be given
tocilizumab. See page 14 for more information
on tocilizumab.

In addition to ICE score, the following
information helps determine the overall
severity of ICANS:


How alert/responsive you are



Whether you are having seizures





Whether you have severe muscle
weakness
Whether there is brain swelling

The ICANS grading system was developed
by the American Society of Blood and Marrow
Transplantation, now the American Society
for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy
(ASTCT).

share with us.

The nervous system side effects of CAR
T-cell therapy are called neurotoxicities.
They include immune effector cell
associated neurotoxicity syndrome
(ICANS) and some other symptoms.

Take our survey,
and help make the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients
better for everyone!

Signs and symptoms








Common symptoms include headache,
delirium, dizziness, trouble sleeping,
shaking, and anxiety.

NCCN.org/patients/comments

Language and nerve problems are also
possible.
Very serious nervous system side effects
include seizures, brain swelling, and
coma. These are usually reversible.
Anti-BCMA products can cause
nervous system side effects that are not
considered part of ICANS and typically
start later.

Treatment






Supportive care may be all that is needed
for mild nervous system side effects.
Intravenous steroids are used to treat
moderate to severe ICANS.
Anakinra may be used to treat severe
ICANS that does not improve with other
treatment.

Questions to ask your
doctor

CAR T-cell therapy is a recent
innovation in cancer treatment.
This chapter includes resources

It is normal to have lots of questions about
immunotherapy with CAR T-cell therapy.
Possible questions to ask your doctor are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own.

for learning more about this type
of immunotherapy and its effects.

Following the questions is a listing of websites
that provide information for patients about CAR
T-cell therapy and its effects.

Immunotherapy Wallet Card
Ask your doctor for an immunotherapy wallet card. This card states
that you have received CAR T-cell therapy. It also lists potential side
effects and contact numbers for your cancer care team. Carry it with
you at all times. If a card is not available, ask for a printable list of
your treatment regimen.

Resources » Questions to ask your doctor

Questions to ask about CAR T side effects
1. Which CAR T product will I be receiving?
2. Will I stay in the hospital afterward or can I be monitored from home?
3. Are there any long-term or permanent side effects?
4. When do they start? How long do they usually last?
5. How are they treated?
6. I didn’t experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Is that bad?
7. How soon can I resume my normal activities after receiving CAR T-cell therapy?
8. After I leave the hospital, which symptoms should I report right away? How do I report
them?
9. Can I report symptoms or communicate with my treatment team online?
10. Can you give me an immunotherapy wallet card?
