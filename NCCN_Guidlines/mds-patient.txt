About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Version 3.2024 –
July 25, 2024.

Is MDS considered cancer?

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
are a group of rare bone marrow

MDS is a type of cancer. Cancer occurs when
cells don’t function as intended and begin
growing out of control.

enough healthy blood cells, which
can cause low blood cell counts.

In healthy bone marrow, undeveloped cells
called stem cells (which look immature in the
bone marrow and are called “blasts”) develop
into the blood cells necessary for healthy
living.

This chapter explains MDS.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group
of rare bone marrow disorders.


In normal healthy bone marrow, blasts make
up about 1 percent (1%) to 2 percent (2%)
of all blood cells and act as seeds for the
growth of all normal types of cells. After they
fully develop in the bone marrow, new blood
cells leave the bone marrow and enter the
peripheral blood to perform their assigned jobs:

myelo- means “bone marrow”

Your bone marrow is the soft material inside
your bones where blood cells are made.


dysplastic means “abnormal
development”



Put together, myelodysplastic syndromes
are diseases where the bone marrow fails to
produce normal blood cells correctly.




Red blood cells: Transport oxygen
throughout the body
White blood cells: Fight infection
Platelets: Form blood clots in response to
injury

However, in MDS, stem cells in the bone
marrow develop genetic errors that affect
their ability to grow. Cells that are produced
by these damaged stem cells do not grow
normally.
They remain relatively immature when looking
under the microscope and often fail to develop
into adult cells. These “dysplastic” (abnormal)
cells take up space and nutrients in the bone
marrow. As a result, they outgrow the healthy

cells and make it harder for normal cells to
develop.



MDS may get worse over time. In some cases,
it may develop into a faster-growing cancer
called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This
occurs when more and more abnormal cells
build up and fill up the bone marrow space like
weeds in a garden.





A person is considered to have AML if they
have a blast percentage of 20 percent (20%),
but experts have been considering lowering
this number to 10 percent (10%).



About 1 out of 3 people with MDS, who have
other risk factors, may develop AML. For more
information, read the NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Acute Myeloid Leukemia, available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

You may be wondering how severe MDS
can be. The answer to this question is that it
depends entirely on the person. Some people
won’t have symptoms or need treatment
for years, while others will need aggressive
treatment for their symptoms right away.
On the other hand, many patients fall between
these two extremes and may need treatment
occasionally for symptoms that come and go.
Finally, as you’ll see throughout this book,
there is also a risk of MDS transforming
into a serious form of leukemia – AML. It’s
a fast-growing form of leukemia and can be
challenging to treat.

Risk factors for MDS
Risk factors don’t necessarily cause cancer.
But having risk factors can increase the
chances of getting cancer. Risk factors for
MDS include:

In Chapter 2, we’ll discuss the categories
used for levels of MDS risk. You can calculate
your level of risk with your care team or use a

Leukopenia

Bleeding that will not stop
is considered a medical
emergency. If you have bleeding
that will not stop, go to the
emergency room or call 911.

Leukopenia is a drop in white blood cells. A
shortage of white blood cells means there are
fewer disease-fighting cells (leukocytes) in
your blood.
Symptoms of leukopenia include:



Fever
Swelling and redness (inflammation) in
and around the mouth

Infections that don’t go away

the number of platelets drops so low that
blood won’t clot, and you can start bleeding

If you have a low platelet count, you may
experience:

Neutropenia
Neutropenia (a type of leukopenia) refers to
a decrease in neutrophils, the most common
type of white blood cell. A lack of neutrophils
can lead to frequent or severe infections.

While not everyone can be cured, anyone
with MDS can receive treatment to reduce
symptoms and prolong life. Some people
don’t require treatment for years, while others
need treatment, such as chemotherapy or
immunotherapy, right away.

Thrombocytopenia
Platelets help control bleeding and heal
wounds by forming blood clots. When you
have a shortage of healthy platelets, that’s
called thrombocytopenia. In rare cases,

In MDS, the bone marrow makes
abnormal blood cells and doesn’t make
enough healthy, mature blood cells for the
body.

NCCN.org/patients/response

When you have low count of a type of
blood cell, it's called cytopenia.
Anemia is a low red blood cell count and,
when unexplained, is usually the first sign
of MDS.
MDS is divided into types based on the
features of the bone marrow and blood
cells, and genetic abnormalities.
MDS can sometimes be cured with a
stem cell transplant in certain people.
Everyone with MDS can be treated to
slow the disease and reduce symptoms.

Family history

Testing is needed to diagnose and
treat myelodysplastic syndromes

Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your health care provider will ask
about the health history of family members
who are blood relatives. This information is
called a family history.

(MDS). This chapter presents an
overview of required tests and
those you might receive.

Before you visit with your health care provider,
you may want to ask your biological family
members about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes and what age
they were diagnosed.

Your provider needs to run tests to properly
diagnose and treat myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS). Some of those tests involve taking
some of your blood from a vein or your bone
marrow; others might involve answering a few
questions about your health.

Documentation of transfusion
Bring any information you may have on your
previous transfusions. This will be helpful for
your health care provider in developing your
treatment plan.

More tests may involve checking your body for
signs of disease. Those tests are detailed in
this chapter.

Medical history

Be ready to tell your doctor about your
medical history, including any family history
of cancer.

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you’ve had in your life.
Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened.




Bring a list of any medicines you take,
including over-the-counter medicines,
herbs, or supplements.

Blood tests

and anemia gets worse, symptoms also get
worse.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and how
well organs are working. They require a blood
sample, which is removed through a needle
placed into your vein.

If you have symptoms of anemia, your health
care provider will perform a series of tests to
identify the type of anemia and how severe it
is. For a full list of tests for all cytopenias, see

Guide 2.

The blood sample will then be sent to a lab for
testing. At the lab, a pathologist (an expert in
lab medicine) will examine the blood sample
with a microscope and perform other tests
outlined below.

Differential
A differential counts the number of each type of
WBC. There are 5 types of WBCs: neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and
basophils.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets in your blood.
A CBC looks for many illnesses, including
anemia, infections, and leukemia.

A differential also checks if the WBC counts
are in balance with each other. Your health
care provider may be able to determine the
cause of an abnormal WBC count from this
test.

Anemia symptoms and testing
Symptoms depend on your specific type of
anemia. Minor symptoms can be so mild that
they go unnoticed. As the body loses more iron

2 Testing for MDS » Blood tests

Types of anemia
Anemia associated with
bone marrow disease

Iron deficiency anemia

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common
type of anemia. It is caused by a lack of iron
in your body. Your bone marrow needs iron
to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is needed
to transport oxygen throughout the body
from your lungs. Without enough iron, your
body can’t produce enough hemoglobin for
red blood cells.

Anemia associated with bone marrow
disease affects the blood produced in your
bone marrow. This anemia includes a variety
of diseases, such as leukemia, MDS, and
myelofibrosis.
Aplastic anemia

In aplastic anemia, normal blood cell
production slows or stops. This occurs
because bone marrow stem cells are
damaged. The number of stem cells also
goes down because they cannot replicate
themselves or are being destroyed by a part
of the immune system.

Sickle cell anemia

Sickle cell anemia is an inherited and serious
condition. It is caused by a defective form
of hemoglobin that forces red blood cells to
take on an abnormal crescent moon (sickle)
shape. The irregular blood cells die too soon,
resulting in an ongoing shortage of red blood
cells.

Hemolytic anemia

Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood
cells are destroyed faster than bone marrow
can replace them. Hemolytic anemia can be
acquired in two ways: you can inherit it or
develop it later in life.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myelodysplastic Syndromes, 2024

Vitamin deficiency anemia

Vitamins (specifically folate, vitamin B12,
and vitamin C) are essential to make healthy
red blood cells. Vitamin deficiency anemia
can occur if you do not eat enough foods
that have folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin C.
It can also occur if your body has trouble
absorbing or processing these vitamins.

14

2 Testing for MDS » Blood tests

Reticulocyte count

out the cause of anemia. People with anemia
from MDS typically have an EPO level that is
higher than normal.

Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells
that are produced in your bone marrow and
released into the peripheral blood (bone
marrow blood). A reticulocyte count can help
your health care provider learn if your bone
marrow is able to produce red blood cells in
response to the development of anemia.

Iron, ferritin, folate, and vitamin
B12
Iron is considered essential because it is
needed to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin
is the protein in red blood cells that carries
oxygen. Ferritin is a protein in your blood that
contains iron.

This test may also help your health care
provider find out the cause of anemia. The
body’s normal response to anemia is for the
bone marrow to make more reticulocytes. A
low reticulocyte count is a sign that the bone
marrow isn’t working to produce more red
blood cells.

A ferritin test will help your provider understand
how much iron is in your body. If the blood
ferritin test is lower than normal, it indicates
an iron deficiency. As a result, you could be
anemic. If the ferritin test is higher than normal,
it could indicate you are storing too much iron.

Blood smear
In a blood smear test, a drop of blood is
placed on a slide so it can be viewed with a
microscope. A pathologist will look at cell size,
shape, type, and maturity. This test is also
used to count the different types of blood cells,
which helps to determine if blood cells are
abnormal in shape or size (dysplasia).

Folate and vitamin B12 are nutrients in the
body that are needed to make red blood cells.
A shortage of folate or B12 can cause anemia.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone
Your thyroid makes hormones to control
how fast your body uses energy. Your health
care provider will test the amount of thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) in your blood. A
high level of TSH in your blood is a sign that
your thyroid is not making enough hormones. If
your thyroid does not make enough hormones,
it can lead to anemia.

A blood smear test may also be used to check
for blast cells in the bloodstream. Blast cells
are normally found in the bone marrow, but in
some cases of MDS, blast cells may be found
in the bloodstream.

Serum erythropoietin

Copper level

Erythropoietin (EPO) helps to stimulate bone
marrow to make more red blood cells. The
body makes EPO when it detects a low level of
oxygen in red blood cells.

Copper is a mineral that helps with many
processes in the body. A low level of copper
can cause the number of red blood cells and
white blood cells to be low. It can also cause
blood cells to have an abnormal size or shape.

By measuring the amount of EPO in the blood,
your health care provider may be able to figure

2 Testing for MDS » Flow cytometry

Flow cytometry

While not a standard test for MDS,testing for
copper level may be done in certain cases
to rule out other causes of the abnormal
appearance or number of blood cells.

Flow cytometry involves adding a lightsensitive dye to cells. The cells are passed
through a beam of light in a machine.
The machine measures the number, size,
shape, and proteins found on the surface of
thousands of cells.

HIV testing
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can
cause low blood cell counts. It can also cause
blood cells to have an abnormal size or shape.
In certain cases, tests may be done to rule out
HIV as the cause of these symptoms.

In some cases of MDS, this test may be used
to identify the specific type of cells present.

HLA typing
A human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a protein
found on the surface of most cells. It plays
an important role in your body’s immune
response. HLA typing is a test that detects a
person’s HLA type.
Blood tests are the main method used to
determine the best course of treatment.

HLAs are unique to each person. They mark
your body’s cells. Your body detects these
markers to tell which cells are yours. All
your cells have the same set of HLAs. Each
person’s set of HLAs is called the HLA type or
tissue type.
This test is required before a donor blood stem
cell transplant, so it’s performed early on. Your
proteins will be compared to the donor’s white
blood cells to see how many proteins are the
same to find the best match. This can take
some time.
If it’s not the best match possible, your body
will reject the donor cells, or the donor cells will
react against your body. Blood samples from
you and your blood relatives will be tested first.

2 Testing for MDS » Bone marrow tests

Bone marrow tests

For the biopsy, a needle will be used to
remove a core sample of bone with marrow.
The samples will be sent to a lab for testing.
You may feel bone pain in your hip for a few
days. Your skin may bruise.

Bone marrow is tested to diagnose and
classify the type of MDS. This test may also
be repeated to tell if the MDS is responding to
treatment or is transforming into acute myeloid
leukemia (AML).

The samples are usually taken from the back
of the hip bone (pelvis). Ask your provider
about the type of bone marrow test you might
have, where the sample will be taken, and if
you will be given a medicine to help you relax.

Two types of bone marrow tests are often done
at the same time:


Aspiration



Biopsy

A bone marrow aspiration takes some of the
liquid out of the spongy tissue of the marrow.
A biopsy takes a piece of the marrow. For
aspiration, a hollow needle will be pushed
through your skin and into the bone. Liquid
bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe.

Removing bone marrow
samples
Samples of your bone marrow
may need to be removed and
tested for diagnosis or treatment
planning. A bone marrow
aspiration removes a small
amount of liquid bone marrow. A
bone marrow biopsy removes a
small piece of bone with marrow.
These procedures are often done
on the back of the hip one after
the other.

Myelodysplastic Syndromes, 2024

2 Testing for MDS » Genetic tests

Genetic tests

Each chromosome contains thousands of
genes. Genes tell cells what to do and what to
become.

If you are suspected of having MDS, you may
receive tests to look for evidence of a cancer
predisposition syndrome that is inherited in
your family line. Some patients who develop
MDS have been born with a mutation that is
present in every cell in their body (“a germline
mutation”).

The following are some genetic tests that may
be done.

Cytogenetic testing
Cytogenetic testing is the study of
chromosomes. Samples of tissue, blood, or
bone marrow are tested to look for changes or
defects in chromosomes.

People who have germline mutations can be at
risk for different types of cancer, not just MDS,
and might have specific physical findings such
as early hair graying or specific skin or bone
findings.

There are many types of chromosome
defects. Part of a chromosome, or a whole
chromosome, may be missing. Or there may
be an extra copy of a chromosome.

Your doctor will ask you about your personal
and family history of cancer as well as whether
you yourself have had more than one type of
cancer. If you have more than two immediate
relatives with cancer or have a diagnosis
of two or more cancers, this increases
the chance that you might have a cancer
predisposition syndrome. Germline genetic
testing can be done on samples from any
tissue of your body (blood, skin, hair, spit).

Health care providers use symbols and
shortened terms to describe the different
types of chromosome changes. A missing
chromosome or missing part of a chromosome
is noted by a minus sign (-) or the word “del”
for deletion. An extra copy of a chromosome is
noted by a plus sign (+).

Specific testing to evaluate the diagnosis of
MDS requires samples obtained from bone
marrow aspirations or biopsies.

Examples of chromosome defects in MDS
include:


Inside our cells are DNA molecules. These
molecules are tightly packaged into what is
called a chromosome.



Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Most human cells contain
23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46
chromosomes.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myelodysplastic Syndromes, 2024



del(5q) and 5q- both mean that the “q” or
longer part of chromosome 5 is missing
-7 and del(7) both mean that a copy of
chromosome 7 is missing
+7 means that there is an extra copy of
chromosome 7

Half of people with MDS have abnormal
chromosomes. The most common
abnormalities in MDS are found on
chromosomes 5, 7, 8, and 20.

chromosome changes helps health care
providers assess the likely outcome
(prognosis) for your MDS. This information can
also help guide treatment options.

with a better or worse prognosis or can help
predict response to different treatments. Health
care providers may test for these common
mutations to help plan treatment.

What are the types of
MDS?

FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a test that identifies the genetic material in a
person’s cells. FISH testing can be done on
samples of blood or bone marrow. This test
detects specific gene or chromosome changes
that are common and known to affect patients
with MDS.

MDS is broken up into types based on bone
marrow and blood cell features as well as
certain genetic abnormalities.
The World Health Organization (WHO)
separates MDS into groups based on genetic
mutations (changes in your DNA) you may
have or how the cells within the bone marrow
look under a microscope. This includes these
specific factors:

Karyotype
A karyotype is a genetic test that produces
an image of a person’s chromosomes. The
test is used to look for abnormal numbers or
structures of chromosomes.



Molecular testing



Molecular testing is used to find small changes
in genes. It is more sensitive than either
karyotype or FISH. Molecular testing is done
on a sample of blood or bone marrow removed
from your body.

bone marrow. This change is called 5q,
which means that part of chromosome 5 is

“Low blasts” means that less than 5 percent

2 Testing for MDS » What are the types of MDS?

The 5q deletion affects the production of
red blood cells. As a result, people with this
mutation tend to have anemia. 5q deletion
accounts for 15 percent of MDS cases and
tends to be more common in older people
assigned female at birth than those assigned
male. People with this type of MDS can live a
long life and rarely develop AML.

Most people have two copies of every gene
in their chromosomes, with some exceptions
—one from each parent. When TP53 is
inactivated in both copies, this is considered a
“biallelic” inactivation.
The blast cell count tends to be higher for
MDS-biTP53, meaning 20 percent or less of
cells in the bone marrow and the peripheral
blood are blast cells.

MDS with low blasts and SF3B1 mutation
(MDS-SF3B1)
Someone with MDS with low blasts and
SF3B1 mutation has a mutation in the SF3B1
gene. Typically, they carry no other existing
mutations. This type was originally called MDS
with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) or refractory
anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS).

About 1 in 10 people with MDS have TP53
inactivation. Of these, 2 in 3 have biallelic
TP53 inactivation. Prognosis (outcome) is
worse than in the other genetic types of MDS.
MDS with biallelic TP53 inactivation can
quickly turn into AML.

MDS-SF3B1 is described as red blood
cells containing rings of iron deposits (ring
sideroblasts). These ring sideroblasts are
leftovers of improper cell development.

MDS types grouped by what the
cells look like
MDS with low blasts (MDS-LB)
Someone with MDS with low blasts means that
less than 5 percent of cells in the bone marrow
are blast cells (immature blood cells) and less
than 2 percent of cells in the peripheral blood
(blood in the bone) are blasts. This is the most
common type of MDS.

This type most often affects older people or
people of late middle age. There is a low risk
of developing AML.
“Low blasts” means that less than 5 percent
of cells in the bone marrow are blast cells
(immature blood cells) and less than 2 percent
of cells in the peripheral blood (blood in the
bone) are blast cells.

This type was originally called MDS with single
lineage dysplasia, or MDS with multilineage
dysplasia, depending on the symptoms. Some
providers may still use these terms but they’re
considered optional today.

MDS with biallelic TP53 inactivation (MDSbiTP53)
Someone with MDS with biallelic TP53
inactivation has a mutation in both copies
of the TP53 gene, which is responsible for
controlling the process of cell death. For most
cancers like MDS, TP53 is necessary for
getting rid of abnormal cells.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myelodysplastic Syndromes, 2024

Some people with MDS with low blasts
have 1 or more cytopenias (one or more
blood cell types are lower than they should
be) and abnormal cells in the bone marrow
(dysplasias).

21

2 Testing for MDS » What are the types of MDS?

Blood and bone marrow are always involved.
At least 2 types of blood counts are low
and have an abnormal appearance under a
microscope (dysplasia). This type of MDS
includes childhood MDS, though it is very rare.

This type was originally called MDS with
excess blasts 1 and 2 (MDS-EB1 + MDSEB2).
MDS with fibrosis (MDS-f)
Someone with MDS with fibrosis (MDS-f) has
5 to 19 percent of blasts in the bone marrow,
and 2 to 19 percent of blasts in the peripheral
blood. This is considered a subtype of MDS
with increased blasts. There also is fibrosis
(scarring) in the bone marrow, typically called
myelofibrosis.

MDS, hypoplastic (MDS-h)
Someone with hypoplastic MDS has less
than approximately 25 percent bone marrow
cellularity, depending on their age. This means
that there are fewer blood cells in the bone
marrow. This is caused by unhealthy T-cells
attacking healthy stem cells, lowering the pool
of cells in the bone marrow as a result.

Myelofibrosis can cause symptoms such as:

Hypoplastic MDS accounts for 10 to 15
percent of all MDS diagnoses. They tend to
not respond well to chemotherapy treatments,
but they can be more likely to respond to
treatments used for aplastic anemia.
The rate of progression of MDS-h into AML is
low.
MDS with increased blasts (MDS-IB1 +
MDS-IB2)
A person with MDS with increased blasts has
more immature blood cells than normal in the
bone marrow.

Fatigue



Shortness of breath



Bleeding and bruising



Abdominal pain



Itchy skin



Unexplained fever



Unexplained weight loss

People with this subtype of MDS tend to have
multiple cytopenias and survival rates aren’t
favorable.

This type of MDS is broken up into two types
based on the number of increased blasts
(MDS-IB1 and MDS-IB2). Those with MDSIB1 have 5 to 9 percent of blasts in the bone
marrow and 2 to 4 percent in the peripheral
blood. Those with MDS-IB2 have 10 to 19
percent of blasts in the bone marrow and 5 to
19 percent in the peripheral blood.

For more information on myelofibrosis,
read the NCCN Guidelines for Patients:
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

It is one of the types of MDS most likely to turn
into AML, with the risk being higher for MDSIB2 than for MDS-IB1.

Scoring and risk groups

Some factors are linked with better outcomes
or a lower chance that MDS will turn into AML.
Other factors help to predict the response to
treatment.

MDS severity is rated through a scoring
system. The score is used to determine the
likely outcome (prognosis) of MDS and to help
develop a treatment plan. A rating, called a risk
score, is used to classify MDS into risk groups.

Based on these prognostic factors, a scoring
system is used to rate and classify the severity
of MDS. This score can be calculated by your
care team.

This section describes the key factors and
scoring systems used to determine MDS
severity.

There are also calculators online that can use
data from your recent test results, but discuss
these with your care team before you take
them seriously.

Prognostic factors
Prognosis is a prediction of the pattern and
outcome of a disease. MDS treatment planning
includes an assessment of the outcome for
MDS. A key aspect of the outcome of MDS is
the chance that it will turn into AML.

If your numbers add up to a lower score, you
have a lower risk of MDS becoming AML.
However, if your score is higher, you have a
higher risk of MDS becoming AML.

Certain factors related to your blood counts,
bone marrow assessment, and karyotype/
molecular profile affect the outcome of MDS.
These are called prognostic factors.

There are three main prognostic scoring
systems for MDS:


These factors will be used to help decide if
cancer treatment is needed right away and
how intensive treatment needs to be.

Very high risk

The MDS Foundation has an IPSS-M
calculator available on its website, available
at: https://www.mds-foundation.org/additionaltools. Discuss the results with your care team.

These 5 risk groups are divided into two basic
risk categories: lower-risk MDS and higher-risk
MDS.

The “lower-risk” MDS group includes
anyone with a very low, low, or
moderate-low risk of disease.

The “lower-risk” MDS group includes
anyone with a very low, low, or
intermediate risk of disease.

“Higher-risk” MDS includes those with
a moderate-high, high, or very high risk
of disease.

“Higher-risk” MDS includes those with
an intermediate, high, or very high risk
of disease.

These scoring systems and risk groups do not
predict how MDS will respond to treatment.
They only help predict how MDS may behave
over time without treatment.

WPSS
The WPSS is not used as often as the IPSS-R.
WPSS differs from the other systems because
it includes the MDS subtype as a prognostic
factor. As for low blood cell counts, the WPSS
gives a score based on the presence or
absence of severe anemia.

Second opinions
It’s normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While MDS should not be ignored,
there is usually time to have another care
provider review your test results and suggest a
treatment plan.

IPSS-M
The IPSS-M is a scoring system that takes
into account blood counts, blast percentage,
IPSS-R risk categories, genetics, and
molecular sequencing results and provides
time estimates for survival and AML
transformation.

A medical history, physical exam, and
blood tests can reveal signs of cancer.
A variety of blood tests are done to
assess the extent and cause of low blood
cell counts.
Bone marrow tests are used to assess the
prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS). A bone marrow biopsy removes
a piece of bone and marrow to test for
cancer cells.
A bone marrow aspiration removes liquid
marrow.
Genetic tests check for abnormal
changes (mutations) in the genes and
chromosomes of MDS cells. It is common
for MDS cells to have genetic mutations.
A risk score is a rating of the severity of
MDS. It describes how slow or fast MDS
will likely progress without treatment.

Chemotherapy

There is more than one treatment
for myelodysplastic syndromes

Chemotherapy (chemo) is a type of drug
therapy used to treat cancer. It works by killing
fast-growing cells in the body. Chemotherapy
is used to destroy cancer cells, but it can also
affect healthy, fast-growing cells like hair.

the types of treatment and what to
expect. Not everyone will receive
the same treatment. Work with

your care team to determine the
best treatment option for your
type of MDS.

Chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are
injected into a vein with a needle, or a pill that
is swallowed. In most cases, chemotherapy is
given in cycles of treatment days followed by
days of rest. This allows the body to recover
before the next cycle.

There are several treatment possibilities for
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS):


Chemotherapy



Immunotherapy



Erythroid maturation agents



Immunomodulators





Cycles vary in length depending on which
chemotherapy is used. You will have tests
to see how well the treatment is working.
You might spend time in the hospital during
treatment.

Azacitidine (Vidaza)



Decitabine (Dacogen)



Oral decitabine and cedazuridine (Inqovi)

These drugs are a type of chemotherapy
called hypomethylating agents. They work by
blocking DNA that helps abnormal cells grow.
This helps to “turn on” genes that promote the
growth of normal, healthy cells in the bone
marrow.

27

3 Treating MDS » Immunosuppressive
Immunosuppressive therapy
therapy » IDH inhibitors » Erythroid maturation agents

Immunosuppressive
therapy

IDH inhibitors
Ivosidenib

Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is a type of
drug therapy that lowers the body's immune
response to allow bone marrow stem cells to
grow and make new blood cells.

Ivosidenib (Tibsovo) is a drug for people with
MDS with IDH1 mutations. The drug is a pill
that, when taken, works by inhibiting the IDH1
mutation. Some people with MDS who take
this drug are able to be weaned off infusion
therapy, which is a type of therapy that uses
a needle placed into a vein, after 6 months of
taking this pill.

Three IST drugs are used to treat MDS,
usually hypocellular MDS with associated
clinical features:


Antithymocyte globulin (Atgam)



Cyclosporin A



Eltrombopag (Promacta)

Erythroid maturation agents
Eltrombopag

Antithymocyte globulin

Eltrombopag (Promacta) is a drug used to
treat adults with low blood platelet counts due
to chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)
when other medicines have not worked. The
drug increases the growth and development
of platelets in the bone marrow. It is used
for people with low platelet levels who also
have either aplastic anemia, chronic immune
thrombocytopenia, or chronic hepatitis
C-associated thrombocytopenia.

Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is a drug used
to treat MDS or reduce rejection after a bone
marrow transplant. ATG works by decreasing
your body's natural defense (immune system).
This allows bone marrow to rebuild its supply
of bone marrow stem cells, thus causing blood
counts to go up.

Cyclosporin A
Cyclosporin A is a drug typically used in
combination with ATG to treat acquired aplastic
anemia, which is a condition where the
immune system attacks the bone marrow. It is
also used to prevent rejection after an organ
transplant and to reduce immune response
after a bone marrow transplant.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myelodysplastic Syndromes, 2024

Imetelstat
Imetelstat (Rytelo) is a drug for patients with
low-risk MDS who rely on transfusions to treat
their anemia. Imetelstat works by targeting
the genetic material of cancerous cells. By
targeting this genetic material, the cells can’t
create new cells or survive on their own, so
they die.

28

3 Treating MDS » Immunomodulators » Hematopoietic cell transplant

Hematopoietic cell
transplant

Luspatercept-aamt
Luspatercept-aamt (Reblozyl) is a drug used
to treat anemia in people with lower-risk
MDS. It works by helping immature red blood
cells develop and become mature, functional
red blood cells. As a result, this increases
hemoglobin levels in the bloodstream, which
improves anemia in people with lower-risk
MDS and anemia.

Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), also
called bone marrow transplant or stem cell
transplant, is a type of treatment that uses
chemotherapy to destroy cells in the bone
marrow and then replaces them with new,
healthy blood-forming cells (“hematopoietic”
means “blood-forming.”) The healthy blood
stem cells will grow, form new bone marrow
and blood cells, and attack remaining cancer
cells.

Immunomodulators
Lenalidomide

For the treatment of MDS, blood stem cells
from a donor are used for the transplant. This
is called an allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT). Before
the transplant, special testing must be done to
make sure the donor is a good match for you.
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is used
to find a person’s tissue type, called an HLA
type.

Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is a drug used to
increase hemoglobin levels. Hemoglobin is the
protein in red blood cells that carry oxygen.
Lenalidomide is used to treat MDS with cells
that are missing part of chromosome 5.
Chromosome 5 controls the amount of red
blood cells that a person might have, which
in turn controls how much hemoglobin a
person has. When this chromosome is
partially missing, it’s referred to as “del(5q).”
Lenalidomide might reduce the amount of
transfusions that people with MDS with del(5q)
need to get.

Treatment steps for allogeneic HCT are
described next.

Conditioning treatment
Before the transplant, you will receive high
doses of strong (high-intensity) chemotherapy.
Reduced-intensity regimens may also be
available. This chemotherapy is referred to as
conditioning treatment since it prepares, or
conditions, your body to receive the donated
blood stem cells.
Chemotherapy destroys normal cells and
cancer cells in your bone marrow. It also
greatly weakens your immune system so that
your body doesn’t kill the transplanted blood
stem cells.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myelodysplastic Syndromes, 2024

29

3 Treating MDS » Clinical trials

Radiation therapy may also be given as part of
conditioning treatment.





Hematopoietic stem cell
transfusion



After the conditioning treatment, the blood
stem cells will be put into your body as a
transfusion. A transfusion is a slow injection of
blood products into a large vein. This process
can take several hours to complete.

Phase IV trials track a drug’s
effectiveness over time after it has been
approved for use.

If you decide to join a clinical trial, you will
need to review and sign a paper called an
informed consent form. This form describes
the study in detail, including the risks and
benefits. Even after you sign a consent form,
you can stop taking part in a clinical trial at any
time.

Until then you will have little or no immune
defense. This will put you at high risk for
infection and bleeding. It may take a few
weeks or months for blood cells to fully recover
and for your immune system to return to
normal.

Ask your treatment team if there is an open
clinical trial that you can join. There may be
clinical trials where you get treatment or at
nearby treatment centers. Discuss the risks
and benefits of joining a clinical trial with your
care team. Together, decide if a clinical trial is
right for you.

Clinical trials
Clinical trials study how safe and helpful tests
and treatments are for people. Clinical trials
find out how to prevent, diagnose, and treat a
disease like cancer. Because of clinical trials,
providers find safe and helpful ways to improve
your care and treatment of cancer.
Clinical trials have 4 phases.
Phase I trials aim to find the safest and
best dose of a new drug. Another aim is to
find the best way to give the drug with the
fewest side effects.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myelodysplastic Syndromes, 2024

Phase III trials compare a new drug to a
standard treatment.

To join a clinical trial, you must meet the
conditions of the study. Patients in a clinical
trial often are alike in terms of their cancer and
general health. This helps to ensure that any
change is from the treatment and not because
of differences between patients.

The transplanted blood stem cells will then
travel to your bone marrow and grow. They will
make new, healthy blood cells. This is called
engraftment. It usually takes about 2 to 4
weeks.

Phase II trials assess if a drug works for a
specific type of cancer.

and dose, length of treatment, and the person.
Some side effects may be harmful to your
health. Others may just be unpleasant.

Supportive care is the cornerstone of all MDS
treatments. Supportive care aims to improve
your quality of life by reducing symptoms from
low blood counts. It includes care for health
issues caused by cancer or cancer treatment.

Ask your treatment team for a complete list of
side effects of your treatments. Also, tell your
treatment team about any new or worsening
symptoms. There may be ways to help you
feel better and to prevent some side effects
before they happen or get worse.

It is sometimes referred to as “palliative care,”
but don’t let that term scare you or limit your
thinking. Supportive care is for everyone.

Psychosocial support

Supportive care options for MDS are described
next and listed in Guide 4.

Distress is normal, common, and expected.
Common symptoms include sadness, fear,
and helplessness. Distress ranges from mild
to extreme levels. Everyone with cancer has
some level of distress at some point in time.
Some people are more likely to be distressed
than others.

General health monitoring
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues. Such health issues are called
side effects. Side effects depend on many
factors. These factors include the drug type

caused by having too few platelets.
Transfusions are needed more frequently
as platelets only survive for a few days.

Antibiotics for bacterial infections
Recurrent infections are one of the most
common issues with MDS, after anemia. A low
level of white blood cells increases your risk
of infection. You should speak to your health
care provider if there are any signs of infection,
such as fever, pneumonia (cough, shortness
of breath), or urinary tract infection (burning
when urinating). You will likely be treated with
antibiotics if you have bacterial infections.

For more information, read the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Distress During
Cancer Care, available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the Patient Guides for
Cancer app.

Cytokines
Cytokines exist naturally in your body as part
of your immune system. They can also be
made in a laboratory to be used as cancer
treatment. Cytokines trigger an immune
response to attack cancer cells.

Quality-of-life assessment
A quality-of-life assessment is used to identify
concerns early on such as pain or other
problems that may be physical, psychosocial,
and spiritual. There are several questionnaires
available to your care team to evaluate quality
of life, some even specific to MDS.

Cytokines used to treat MDS include epoetin
alfa and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
(G-CSF). Epoetin alfa/darbepoetin alfa are
used to treat a lower-than-normal number of
red blood cells. G-CSF is a type of drug called
a growth factor. It increases the number of
blood cells in the blood. It can be used with
chemotherapy, or before and after a stem cell
transplant.

Transfusions
Low red blood cell counts caused by
anemia may cause severe fatigue and other
symptoms. People with MDS experiencing
symptoms of anemia may benefit from a
transfusion of red blood cells or platelets.




Aminocaproic acid

Red blood cells – Transfusions of red
blood cells may be needed to treat
symptoms of anemia, such as shortness
of breath or fatigue.

If your bleeding is not helped with a transfusion
or a growth factor (such as darbepoetin alfa),
then another option might be treatment with a
drug called an antifibrinolytic agent, such as
aminocaproic acid (Amicar).

Platelets – Transfusions of platelets
may prevent or treat bleeding problems

Treatment team
Treating cancer takes a team approach. Some members of your care team will be with you
throughout cancer treatment, others will only be there for certain parts of it. Get to know
your care team and help them get to know you.
Depending on your diagnosis, your team might include the following specialists. Ask who will
coordinate your care:
•

Your primary care provider handles medical care not related to cancer. This person can
help you express your feelings about treatments to your cancer care team.

•

A pathologist interprets the cells, tissues, and organs removed during a biopsy or
surgery.

•

A diagnostic radiologist reads the results of x-rays and other imaging tests.

•

An interventional radiologist performs needle biopsies, ablations, and arterially directed
therapies, and places ports for treatment.

•

A surgical oncologist performs operations to remove cancer.

•

A medical oncologist treats cancer in adults using systemic therapy. Often, this person
will lead the overall treatment team and keep track of tests and exams done by other
specialists.

•

A radiation oncologist prescribes and plans radiation therapy to treat cancer.

•

An anesthesiologist gives anesthesia, a medicine so you do not feel pain during surgery
or procedures.

•

A palliative care specialist is an expert in the treatment of symptoms caused by cancer
to improve a patient’s quality of life and ease suffering.

•

Advanced practice providers are registered nurse practitioners and physician assistants
who monitor your health and provide care.

•

Oncology nurses provide hands-on care, like giving systemic therapy, managing your
care, answering questions, and helping you cope with side effects.

•

Nutritionists can guide you on what foods or diets are most suitable for your particular
condition.

•

Psychologists and psychiatrists are mental health experts who can help manage issues
such as depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions that can affect how you
feel.

Iron chelation
While transfusions help relieve symptoms
of MDS or anemia, too many transfusions
(20 or more), may cause iron to build up that
can cause organ damage (iron overload). An
overload of iron requires a special treatment to
remove the excess iron.

This is called iron chelation. In iron chelation,
drugs called chelating agents (deferoxamine
as an injection under the skin or deferasirox
as a pill) are used to bind with the iron so the
body can get rid of it.

Chemotherapy is used to destroy cancer
cells, but it can also affect normal cells.
Immunotherapy supports the body's
natural defenses to fight myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS).
The goal of a hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT) is to cure cancer by
replacing unhealthy blood stem cells with
healthy ones that will attack cancer cells.
Supportive care is the cornerstone of all
MDS treatments. Supportive care aims
to improve your quality of life by reducing
symptoms.
Distress is normal, common, and

Low-risk MDS with anemia

There is more than one treatment

syndrome (MDS). This chapter
presents all of the treatment

If you are experiencing symptoms of anemia
and are found to have MDS with del(5q),
treatment will be based on the level of
erythropoietin (EPO) in the blood. EPO is a
hormone produced mainly by the kidneys. It
plays a key role in the production of red blood
cells.

options recommended by NCCN
MDS experts at this time.

Lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
is slow-growing and may not progress to acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) for a long time. The
goals in treating lower-risk MDS are to improve
blood cell counts, reduce the need for blood
transfusions, and improve quality of life.

Serum EPO 500 mU/mL or less
MDS with low blasts, del(5q), and a serum
EPO of 500 mU/mL or less is treated with
lenalidomide (preferred treatment) or an
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, such as
epoetin alfa (Procrit) or darbepoetin alfa
(Aranesp).

Lower-risk MDS includes the following risk
groups:


IPSS-R very low, low, and intermediate



WPSS very low, low, and intermediate



IPSS-M very low, low, and moderate low

Lenalidomide is a chemotherapy drug used
to increase hemoglobin levels. Epoetin
alfa/darbepoetin alfa is a synthetic form
of erythropoietin used to treat anemia by
increasing red blood cell production.

If you have one of these risk groups of
MDS without symptoms, you may not need
treatment right away. Instead, you will have
regular check-ups and your blood counts
will be checked. This is referred to as active
monitoring or “watching and waiting.”

If neither of the treatments described above
work for you, NCCN MDS experts recommend
finding a clinical trial or your care team will
prescribe you a chemotherapy such as
azacitidine (Vidaza). Other options include
chemotherapies like decitabine (Dacogen, as
an infusion) or decitabine and cedazuridine
(Inqovi, as an oral treatment), or an
immunotherapy, imetelstat (Rytelo), depending
on your health and age.

However, if you have low-risk MDS with
anemia and are having some symptoms, you
may need treatment. Let’s look at some of
these treatment options below.
For more information about how any of these
treatments work in your body, see Chapter 3:
Treating MDS.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myelodysplastic Syndromes, 2024

Low doses of azacitidine or decitabine have
been shown to show some improvement for
people with low-risk MDS. Oral decitabine
and cedazuridine (Inqovi) can be used as

a replacement for intravenous decitabine in
patients at lower risk for MDS.

If you have a SF3B1 mutation and there are
low blasts, you may receive luspatercept-aamt
(Reblozyl), which is an erythroid maturation
agent. Or you may receive imetelstat (Rytelo),
which is an immunotherapy. If there is no
response on the imetelstat, you’ll be started on
lenalidomide, which is an immunomodulator.

If you have an IDH1 mutation and none of
these treatments are working, then you may
be prescribed the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib
(Tibsovo). If you do not have an IDH1
mutation, consider entering a clinical trial. Or
depending on your health, you might be a
candidate for a bone marrow transplant.
Serum EPO more than 500 mU/mL
MDS with low blasts, del(5q), and a serum
EPO of 500 mU/mL or more is treated with
lenalidomide, which is an immunomodulator.

If there’s no response on luspatercept-aamt,
the next treatment depends on the serum
EPO. See below for more information. For
more information on treatment for MDS with
SF3B1, see Guide 5 on the next page.

If the treatment described above doesn’t work
for you, NCCN MDS experts recommend
finding a clinical trial or your care team will
prescribe you azacitidine (Vidaza), which is a
chemotherapy.

Serum EPO 500 mU/mL or less
MDS with SF3B1 and serum EPO of 500 mU/
mL or less is treated with imetelstat (Rytelo),
which is an immunotherapy.
Other recommended treatments include
an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, such
as epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa, with or
without a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF). Epoetin alfa/darbepoetin alfa is a
synthetic form of EPO used to treat anemia by
increasing red blood cell production. G-CSF
drives the bone marrow to make additional
neutrophils or granulocytes and decrease the
risk for infection. This drug can be used with
chemotherapy, or before or after stem cell
transplant.

Other options include chemotherapies like
decitabine (Dacogen, as an infusion) or

Serum EPO more than 500 mU/mL
MDS with serum EPO more than 500 mU/
mL is treated based on the probability of
responding to immunosuppressive therapy
(IST). IST is used to treat people 60 years of
age or under who have 5 percent (5%) or less
marrow blasts.

Low-risk MDS without
anemia
If you have thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or
increased marrow blasts you will be treated by
hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine
(Vidaza), decitabine (Dacogen), decitabinecedazuridine (Inqovi), IST in certain cases
(with or without eltrombopag), or clinical trial.
IST is used to treat people aged 60 years or
under who have 5 percent (5%) or less marrow
blasts.

If there is a good chance for a response to the
IST, treatment will also include antithymocyte
globulin (ATG) with or without cyclosporin A
and/or eltrombopag (Promacta).
ATG is a drug used to treat MDS or reduce
rejection after a bone marrow transplant.
ATG works by decreasing your body’s natural
defense (immune system). This allows bone
marrow to rebuild its supply of bone marrow
stem cells, causing blood counts to go up.

If there is no response or your disease
worsens, your health care provider will
consider other recommended medicines, a
clinical trial, or a bone marrow transplant. If
you have an IDH1 mutation, you might receive
ivosidenib.

Cyclosporin A is used to prevent organ
rejection after transplant. Eltrombopag is used
to treat low platelet counts in the bloodstream.

For more information, see Guide 6.

MDS/MPN, not otherwise specified (NOS)

CMML

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group
of diseases where the bone marrow does not
make enough healthy mature blood cells (red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)
is a disease in which too many monocytes, a
type of white blood cell, develop in the bone
marrow. Some of the cells do not develop into
mature white blood cells.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a
group of diseases where the body makes too
many of one or more types of blood cells.

The monocytes and immature blood cells
(called blasts) overwhelm the other cells in
the bone marrow so there are not enough red
blood cells and platelets.

MDS can overlap with MPN. These are called
myeloid disorders.

The World Health Organization (WHO)
categorizes CMML into 2 subtypes based on
the number of blasts in the blood and bone
marrow:

Myeloid disorders have dysplastic (abnormal
cells) and proliferative (increased numbers
of cells) features. These disorders are not
considered to be MDS or MPN, because they
have some features of both syndromes.



NCCN considers myeloid disorders to be
a subtype of MDS in its clinical guidelines,
but if you need to know more about MPN
specifically, read the NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Myeloproliferative Neoplasms,

Treatment

MDS/MPN and neutrophilia
MDS/MPN and neutrophilia is a rare disorder
where too many blood stem cells in the bone
marrow develop into granulocytes (a type of
white blood cell). Neutrophilia is defined as
having too many granulocytes in the blood.

Treatment options are based on the subtype
of MDS/MPN disorder. Options range from
observation to hypomethylating agents
(HMAs), such as azacitidine and decitabine,
to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(allogenic HCT, also referred to as bone
marrow transplant or stem cell transplant).

Some of the granulocytes do not mature.
Immature blood cells are called blasts.
Gradually the blasts and granulocytes
overwhelm healthy red blood cells and
platelets in the bone marrow.

For information on specific subtypes and their
treatment options, see Guide 8.

MDS/MPN, not otherwise specified
MDS/MPN, not otherwise specified (NOS),
is a rare disorder where too many stem
cells in the bone marrow develop into blood
cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or
platelets). Some of the blood cells do not
mature. Immature blood cells are called blasts.
Gradually the blasts and abnormal cells crowd
out the healthy blood cells in the bone marrow.

MDS/MPN with SF3B1 mutation
and thrombocytosis
MDS/MPN with SF3B1 mutation and
thrombocytosis is a disorder with a high level
of one or more types of blood cells in the blood
and bone marrow. In this subtype, at least
15 percent (15%) of immature blood cells in
the bone marrow are ring sideroblasts with a
high platelet count (greater than or equal to
450,000).

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:




What you want and how that might differ
from what others want

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Your religious and spiritual beliefs

Support groups



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.






Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life and length of life
How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Questions to ask

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your
