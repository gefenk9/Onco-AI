About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Colorectal Cancer Screening, Version 1.2024 –

early, when a cure is more likely.

Colorectal cancer refers to cancers that form
in the colon or rectum. These organs make up
the large intestine, also called the large bowel.

Most people are at average risk and have
several types of screening tests to choose
from.

In the colon, the food you eat becomes feces
(stool). Stool is held in the rectum until it
leaves the body during a bowel movement.

In the United States, American Indians/Alaska
Natives and Black individuals are more likely to
develop, and to die from, colorectal cancer.

The bowel wall is made of layers of tissue.
Cancer starts in the innermost layer that
comes in contact with stool.

The large bowel
The start of the colon is a
pouch called the cecum.
The rest of the colon
has 4 main sections: the
ascending, transverse,
descending, and sigmoid
colon. The rectum is the
last part of the large bowel.
Stool is held there until it
leaves the body through
the anus.

1 About colorectal cancer screening » Polyps and lesions

Polyps and lesions

While most polyps don’t become cancer, your
cancer risk is increased if you’ve had any of
the types described next.

Polyps are non-cancerous growths on the
inner lining of the large bowel. Some types are
more likely to form cancer than others.

Adenomas

There are different shapes and sizes of polyps,
including some that are very flat and subtle.
Pedunculated polyps have a stalk and stick out
from the colon wall. Sessile polyps are flatter
and don’t have a stalk.

Adenomas are the most common type
of polyp. They are pre-cancerous. This
means that while it may take many years,
an adenoma can become invasive cancer.
Cancer that forms in an adenoma is called an
adenocarcinoma. It is the most common type
of colorectal cancer.

Removing polyps can prevent cancer before
it starts. Most can be removed during a
colonoscopy. Non-invasive screening tests can
detect polyps, but cannot remove them.

Growth patterns refer to how a polyp looks
when viewed under a microscope. Adenomas
have 3 types of growth patterns: tubular (most
common), villous, and tubulovillous.

Polyps can also be tested to make sure that
cancer hasn’t started to develop.

Polyps are growths on the
lining of the bowel wall.
Pedunculated polyps look

1 About colorectal cancer screening » Polyps and lesions

Some adenomas are more likely to become
cancer than others. These “advanced”
adenomas have at least 1 of the following
features:


Are 1 centimeter (1 cm) or larger in size



Have high-grade dysplasia



Have a villous or tubulovillous cell pattern

Screening vs. diagnosis
Cancer screening is for people with no
signs or symptoms of colorectal cancer.
If you have signs or symptoms, the aim
of testing is to find the problem and
make a diagnosis. Contact your health
care provider if you have these signs or
symptoms:

Adenomas are also called adenomatous
polyps, traditional polyps, and conventional
polyps.

Serrated polyps

Bloody stools

Serrated polyps can also form pre-cancerous
cells. These polyps have a saw-tooth pattern
when viewed under a microscope.
Sessile serrated polyps (also called sessile
serrated lesions) are flatter polyps without a
stalk.

Change in bowel
habits

Traditional serrated adenomas are rare polyps
that have a villous growth pattern.
Hyperplastic polyps are also part of the
serrated family of polyps. While most don’t
become cancer, experts are unsure whether
hyperplastic polyps larger than 1 centimeter
increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Because
they might, more frequent screening is often
recommended for large hyperplastic polyps.

Other ways to lower your
risk
Screening is the best way to prevent colorectal
cancer. Other steps you can take to lower your
risk are described next.

Other ways to lower your risk of colorectal cancer
Eat a healthy diet rich in plant-based foods. Limit red meat
and processed foods. Get your nutrients from real foods; don’t
rely on supplements alone.

Drink little to no alcohol.

Move more, rest less.

Maintain a healthy weight. Tracking your weight, diet, calories,
and activity levels may help you meet your goals.

Stop using tobacco. Ask your care team about options to help
you quit. Counseling and medication are often options.
Get your vitamin D from foods like salmon, tuna, mackerel,
and egg yolks. Your skin can also make vitamin D when
exposed to the sun, but remember to wear sunscreen when
outside for a long time.

2 Screening in those at average risk » Colonoscopy

Colonoscopy

Endoscopic procedures are the only screening
method that can remove polyps.

In the United States, colonoscopy is the most
common colorectal cancer screening test,
regardless of risk level.

Bowel cleanout
Colonoscopy requires that your bowel be
cleared of stool. This bowel prep consists of a
liquid diet and strong laxatives. Follow the prep
instructions carefully. If your bowel isn’t clear
enough, you may have to reschedule or repeat
the test.

This procedure allows a health care provider,
usually a gastroenterologist, to examine
the entire large bowel and to remove any
abnormal growths.
Along with flexible sigmoidoscopy (described
next), colonoscopy is considered a(n):

What to expect
You will likely wear a hospital gown. The test
will be performed while you lie on your side. If
you opted to be asleep for the procedure, you
will be given an intravenous sedative.

Colonoscopy
Colonoscopy is a procedure that
allows your doctor to see and
remove any abnormal tissue from
the colon. A thin device is
inserted through the anus, up the
rectum, and into the colon. The
device has a light, a camera, and a
cutting tool.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Colorectal Cancer Screening, 2024

13

2 Screening in those at average risk » Colonoscopy

Results and next screen

Your provider will insert a long thin device with
a light and a camera into your anus and gently
guide it through the entire large bowel. They
will view your colon on a monitor and look for
abnormal growths.

If no polyps are found, you can wait 10 years
until your next screen, and you can use any
screening method. You can also wait 10
years if the only polyp(s) found are small and
hyperplastic.

If any polyps or lesions are found, they will
remove them during the procedure using a
cutting tool. This is called polypectomy. Most
polyps can be removed this way. Surgery is
rarely needed.

If any of the following polyps are found,
you should stick with colonoscopy for your
next screen. And, the timing of your next
colonoscopy depends on the number, size,
and other features of the removed polyps.

The number of polyps, and their size and
location, will be noted in a colonoscopy report.
The removed polyps will be sent to an expert
called a pathologist to examine. This doctor
will look for cancer cells in the polyp using
a microscope. If any are found, a cancer
diagnosis will be made.

Adenoma (any size)



Sessile serrated polyp (any size)



Hyperplastic polyp 1 cm or larger

On the next pages, information on rescreening
after having polyps removed is provided.

The diagnosis will be included in a pathology
report, along with other details of the tissue
tests. The next steps of care will be based
on the details of your colonoscopy and the
pathologic findings.
A colonoscopy takes less than an hour.
Afterward, you may stay for another hour for
any drugs that were used to wear off. You
will need someone to drive you home. The
next day, you will likely feel normal. Contact
your doctor if you have severe pain, vomiting,
bloody stool, or weakness.

Small polyp(s) removed

Large polyp(s) removed

When one or two small adenomas are found
and removed, time until rescreening is similar
to average risk. Serrated polyps are more
likely to return after being removed, so the
interval is shorter. See the chart below for
more details.

Polyps 1 cm or larger can be hard to remove.
They may also have other features that
increase the risk of cancer.
After removal of a large pedunculated
polyp that showed no signs of cancer,
colonoscopy is recommended in 3 years.

A very large number of polyps may be due to
a hereditary cancer syndrome. Your provider
is likely to refer you for genetic testing if you've
had many polyps removed.

Sessile polyps tend to grow back after
treatment. For sessile polyps and lesions
without high-risk features, colonoscopy is

Guides for Cancer app.

For sessile polyps with high-risk features,
or that weren’t removed in one piece,
colonoscopy is recommended in 6 months. If
results are normal, your next colonoscopy will
take place in 1 year, then again 3 years later if
results are normal.

These resources address mismatch repair
(MMR) testing. All colorectal cancers should be
tested for this biomarker (feature).

Who is most affected?
In the United States, American
Indians/Alaska Natives and Black
individuals are more likely to develop
colorectal cancer and to die from it
than any other racial or ethnic group.
These individuals also often face
barriers to colorectal cancer
screening.

This visual screening method is an exam of the
rectum and the last part of the colon. To see
these areas, your provider will gently insert a
device with a tiny camera through your anus
and into the large bowel.
If no polyps are found, screening is
recommended again in 5 to 10 years using any
method. This also applies if the only polyps
found are hyperplastic and smaller than 1 cm.

CT colonography

If any polyps are found, colonoscopy is
recommended. If only 1 to 2 tiny polyps are
found, waiting 3 years and rescreening with CT
colonography is also an option.

Computed tomography (CT) colonography,
also called virtual colonoscopy, is another
screening option for people at average risk.
This test uses a CT scanner and a small
amount of radiation to get a close look at the
large bowel. It also shows nearby organs in the
abdomen.
CT colonography is non-invasive and doesn’t
require sedation. A disadvantage is that bowel
cleaning is needed, just like for a colonoscopy.
If no polyps or lesions are found, screening
is recommended again in 5 years using any
method. Speak with your provider about the
benefits and risks of each method.

Stool-based screening

If the results of guaiac FOBT or FIT are
positive, colonoscopy is recommended
within 9 months. If the results are negative,
screening (with any method) is recommended
again in 1 year.

Stool-based tests can detect signs of
colorectal cancer in a stool sample. These
signs include blood and DNA released by
abnormal cells.

Multi-targeted stool DNA test

Stool-based tests are only FDA-approved for
those at average risk of colorectal cancer.

This method looks for both blood and
DNA in your stool that could be caused
by a precancerous polyp or colon cancer.
Cologuard is a currently available multitargeted stool DNA test.

This method involves collecting a sample of
your stool at home and sending it to a lab for
testing.
Stool tests are easier than colonoscopy, but
they aren’t as good at finding polyps that could
become cancer. And, if stool test results are
abnormal, a colonoscopy is recommended 6 to
10 months afterward.

If the results are positive, colonoscopy is
recommended within 9 months.
If the stool DNA results are negative, screening
(using any method) is recommended again in
3 years.

Fecal occult blood tests

Blood-based screening

Fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) look for
occult (hidden) blood in stool. The most
common type uses guaiac, a substance used
to coat the stool sample cards. If there is
blood in the sample, the guaiac will cause it to
change color rapidly.

FDA-approved blood tests for colorectal
cancer screening are available. At this time,
they are only for people at average risk who
can't or won't use other screening methods.

Guaiac FOBT requires that you collect 3 stool
samples in a row. It also requires that you
follow a special diet.

After screening with a blood-based test, it
is unknown how long to wait until your next
screening. Talk to your health care provider
about the timing of your next screen.

The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is another
type of FOBT. A sample of stool is placed in
a collection tube or on a card for testing. FIT
uses an antibody that binds to a blood protein
called hemoglobin to detect blood.
Unlike guaiac FOBT, the FIT doesn’t require
changing your diet. And many brands only
require 1 stool sample per year.

Know your family history

People at average risk start screening
at age 45 and have several screening
methods to choose from. Discuss the pros
and cons of each option with your health
care provider.

A family history is one of the most
important risk factors for colorectal
cancer. Be prepared to tell your health
care provider the following information:

The time until the next screening varies
based on the prior screening method.
If you have normal colonoscopy results,
screening isn't needed for another 10 years.
After screening with a stool-based test,
rescreening ranges from 1 to 3 years.
If you opt for a noninvasive screening
method and the test is positive, a
colonoscopy is needed to complete the
screening process.
You are at increased risk of colorectal
cancer if you you’ve had an adenoma
or a sessile serrated polyp. After these
polyps are removed, the timing of your next
screening will be based on the number and
features of the removed polyps.

People with primary sclerosing cholangitis
should start screening when they are
diagnosed with PSC, regardless of when their
IBD symptoms started.

screening method for everyone
at increased risk of colorectal
cancer.

Screening methods
Colonoscopy should always be used to screen
for colorectal cancer in people with IBD. Your
doctor will gently guide a thin device through
your anus and into your colon while you are
sedated.

Inflammatory bowel disease
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group
of health problems that cause long-term
swelling and damage in the digestive tract. The
damage can lead to the growth of abnormal
cells, which can become cancer over time.

Dysplasia can be hard to see with a typical
colonoscopy, so it is paired with newer
methods in order to see better. These include:


Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s colitis are types
of IBD. These conditions often start before
30 years of age, or much later in life. Having
either increases your risk of colorectal cancer.



Chromoendoscopy

Chromoendoscopy involves applying a stain to
the inner lining of the bowel. The stain makes
it easier to see abnormal areas and perform
targeted biopsies.

Your risk is further increased if colorectal
cancer runs in your family, or if you have
primary sclerosing cholangitis, a health
condition that causes damage and narrowing
of the bile ducts.

Your provider will biopsy (remove samples
from) any areas that look abnormal. They will
also take random samples from every section
of the large bowel.

Dysplasia is hard to see because it often
occurs in a flat and normal-looking section of
the colon wall. It’s ideal to do screening when
IBD is inactive.

Resectable polyps or lesions
Polyps and lesions that can be safely removed
are called resectable. If any are found, they will
be removed endoscopically (if possible). The
timing of your next colonoscopy depends on
the features of the removed polyps.

Start of cancer screening
In people with IBD affecting the colon, most
should start screening for colorectal cancer
8 years after their IBD symptoms started.
Starting earlier than 8 years is recommended if
you have a family history of colorectal cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Colorectal Cancer Screening, 2024

High-definition white light endoscopy
(HDWLE)

For lower risk polyps that are completely
removed, colonoscopy is recommended in 1 to
3 years.
22

3 Screening in those at increased risk » Cystic fibrosis

Colon stricture

For higher risk polyps that are completely
removed, rescreening is recommended in 1
year, but may be needed as soon as 3 months
afterward.

Over time, IBD can cause scar tissue to form in
the lining of the bowel. This causes the bowel
to narrow in certain areas, called strictures.

If a polyp wasn’t fully removed, you may be
referred to an endoscopist trained in advanced
resection techniques, or to a surgeon who
specializes in IBD.

Colon strictures can have underlying cancer,
especially in people with long-term IBD. If
surveillance screening detects a stricture, you
should be seen by an expert in IBD.

Invisible dysplasia

The next step of care may be surgery to
remove all or part of your colon. This is called
colectomy. If surgery isn’t planned, rescreening
in 1 year is recommended.

Testing may find dysplasia (abnormal tissue) in
samples that looked normal during endoscopy.
This is called invisible dysplasia. It can’t be
seen with an endoscope.

Cystic fibrosis

If dysplasia is confirmed, chromoendoscopy
is the next step (if not already performed).
Your provider may perform this, or refer
you to an endoscopist with expertise in
chromoendoscopy. Your provider may also
refer you to a surgeon who specializes in IBD
to discuss surveillance versus surgery.

People with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk
of colorectal cancer. It often develops earlier in
people with this condition compared to those at
average risk. If you’ve had an organ transplant
for managing cystic fibrosis, the risk is even
higher.

No dysplasia found

In those who have had an organ transplant,
colonoscopy is recommended starting at age
30, or within 2 years of the transplant. If you
haven’t had an organ transplant, screening
starts at age 40.

If no dysplasia is found, colonoscopy is
recommended in 1 year for those at high risk.
High-risk features include primary sclerosing
cholangitis, active inflammation, and a family
history of colorectal cancer diagnosis before
age 50.

A more thorough bowel cleanout process is
needed before colonoscopy for those with
cystic fibrosis. Your care team will instruct you
on the bowel prep.

For all others without active inflammation, the
next colonoscopy should take place in 2 to 5
years.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Colorectal Cancer Screening, 2024

If the colonoscopy results are normal, the next
will take place in 5 years. If the colonoscopy
finds pre-cancerous polyps, the next is
recommended 3 years.

Family history of colorectal
cancer

In most families with a history of colorectal
cancer, the cause isn’t clear. It may be caused
by shared genes, shared experiences, or
both. In rare cases, the cause is a hereditary
colorectal syndrome. More information on
these syndromes is provided below. The
following recommendations don’t apply to
families with these syndromes.

Your provider will ask about the health history
of your biological (related by blood) family
members. If you have a first-degree relative
with a history of colorectal cancer, you are at
increased risk of developing it too.

3 Screening in those at increased risk » Family history of colorectal cancer

First-degree relatives with
advanced high-risk polyps

Compared to average-risk screening,
screening based on family history often
starts earlier and is more frequent. The time
between screenings might be lengthened if 2
screenings in a row are normal. Other factors
that may alter screening include your age
and the number and age of affected family
members.

If 1 or more of your first-degree relatives has
had an advanced, high-risk polyp, screening
colonoscopy is recommended at age 40, or at
the age the relative was diagnosed, whichever
comes first.
Screening should be repeated every 5 to 10
years, as long as the results continue to be
normal. Or, you and your provider may decide
on a different screening schedule based on
your age, your preferences, and the details of
your family history.

Share your screening results with your family.
Tell them if any polyps or any cancers are
found. When they know your history, they
can make informed decisions. Screening
recommendations for family members may be
included in your colonoscopy report. Some
providers will give you a letter for you to share
with your first-degree relatives.

Second- or third-degree relatives
with CRC

First-degree relative(s) with CRC

If you have any second- or third-degree (but
no first-degree) relatives who have been
diagnosed with colorectal cancer, screening
should start at age 45, like those at average
risk.

If you have any first-degree relatives
diagnosed with colorectal cancer at any age,
colonoscopy is recommended beginning
at age 40, or 10 years before the earliest
diagnosis in your family. For example, if your
first-degree relative was diagnosed at age 44,
you should start screening at age 34.

While your risk of colorectal cancer might
be higher than someone at average risk,
studies haven’t found enough data to support
screening before age 45.

Repeating colonoscopy every 5 years is
recommended if results are normal. Or, you
and your provider may decide on a different
screening schedule based on your age,
preferences, and the details of your family
history.

Repeating colonoscopy is recommended every
10 years, as long as results continue to be
normal.

Hereditary cancer syndromes
Hereditary cancer syndromes are rare
syndromes caused by changes in certain
genes that are most often passed down from a
birth parent to a child. A genetic cause is more
likely if you have many relatives with colorectal
cancer, and if their cancer was diagnosed
before age 45.

“

People born with Lynch syndrome are at high
risk of developing several types of cancer such
as colon, endometrial, and ovarian cancers.
Lynch syndrome is caused by inherited
mutations of the mismatch repair (MMR)
genes.

My genetic testing, which identified
me with an MSH2 mutation (Lynch
syndrome), helped me make
decisions about future treatment
and understand my future risk for
other cancers. This allowed me an
opportunity to be proactive in my
own health care."

Polyposis syndromes are a group of cancer
syndromes that cause colorectal polyps. The
most common is familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP). FAP causes hundreds to thousands of
polyps to form in the colon and rectum.
If an inherited syndrome is suspected, your
doctor will refer you to a genetic counselor.
This expert can speak with you and your
family about testing for syndromes related
to colorectal cancer. To be tested, you must
provide a sample of blood or saliva. The
sample is sent to a lab to look for gene
mutations that cause these syndromes.
It is important to meet with a genetic counselor
before having any genetic testing.

Take steps to get screened

Some cancer treatments increase your risk of
developing another cancer years later. If you
had treatment with any of the following as a
child, adolescent, or young adult, you are at
higher risk of colorectal cancer:

You can take steps to get screened and
reduce your risk of colorectal cancer:
•

Start the conversation early. Before
age 45, discuss your risk of colorectal
cancer with your health care provider.

•

Know your family history of colorectal
cancer, which may require earlier
screening.

•

Learn about your options for colorectal
cancer screening.

•

Start screening on time and stay on
schedule for follow-up screening.

•

Be active, make healthy food choices,
and quit using tobacco.

chemotherapy
radiation therapy (especially to the
abdomen, pelvis, or spine)
total body irradiation (regardless of dose,
with or without chemotherapy)

For those with a history of chemotherapy only,
colonoscopy is recommended starting at age
35, or 10 years after chemotherapy (whichever
happens last). This means that if you had
chemotherapy at age 28, screening starts at
age 38. Screening should always start by age
45, and should be repeated every 5 years.
For those who had radiation therapy
as described above, colonoscopy is
recommended starting at age 30, or 5 years
after treatment (whichever occurs last).
Screening should always start by age 45, and
should be repeated every 5 years.

to have a baseline (starting) look at your GI
tract that can be compared to future GI exams.

If you’ve had 10 or more polyps (of any
type) anywhere in your GI tract, they could
be caused by your prior cancer treatment.
This is more likely if comprehensive genetic
testing didn’t find any gene changes linked
with colorectal cancer or hereditary polyp
syndromes.
In this case, your provider may suggest
an upper endoscopy (in addition to the
colonoscopy surveillance). This will allow them

People with cystic fibrosis are at
increased risk of colorectal cancer.
If you’ve had an organ transplant,
colonoscopy is recommended starting at
age 30, or within 2 years of the transplant.
Otherwise, screening starts at age 40.

Let us know what
you think!

People with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) affecting the colon have
an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
Screening should start 8 years after IBD
symptoms begin, or earlier if you have
a family history or primary sclerosing
cholangitis. The time until the next
screening ranges from 3 months to 3
years based on cancer risk.

If you have a family history of colorectal
cancer or pre-cancerous polyps,
screening often starts at or before age 40.
You may be rescreened in as soon as 5
years, even if no polyps are found.
Treatment with chemotherapy or radiation
therapy as a child or young adult
increases your risk of colorectal cancer
later in life. Screening should start earlier
than recommended for people at average
risk.

cancer is being diagnosed more
often in people under the age of 45.
These cancers can be mistaken for
hemorrhoids or other non-cancerous
conditions. If you see blood in your

Colorectal cancer has always been
thought of as an 'old person’s
disease.' Now, studies have shown
that a person born on or after 1990
is 2 to 4 times more likely to develop
colorectal cancer compared to
a person born in 1950. Because
of this, it is very important to get
screened at 45 years old."
