About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Distress Management, Version 1.2024 — October 27, 2023.

How can I get help?

What is distress?

If your cancer care team isn’t asking about
distress, let them know how you feel. Once
your team knows your situation, they can help.

Distress includes common feelings like
sadness, worry, and anger but is much
broader. It is defined as an unpleasant
experience of a mental, physical, social, or
spiritual nature. Distress can affect the way
you think, feel, or act.

This book explains how your team can
refer you to resources and what resources
may be available to you. It includes expert
recommendations for managing distress.

Distress among people
with cancer varies greatly.
What causes distress for

Distress also affects people
in different ways. There are

cancer centers. They emphasize several
standards of care for distress, including:








Distress should be routinely assessed
with a screening tool. Screening tools
are quick and simple. The screening tool
developed by NCCN, called the NCCN
Distress Thermometer and Problem List,
is explained in Chapter 2.





Screening tools should measure the
level and nature of your distress. This
information helps your care team know
if you need help and if so, what kind of
help you need. Distress can be caused by
many things, such as cancer symptoms,
work concerns, and grief.

Being distressed can make it harder to
cope with cancer.
You should expect to receive distress
screening and help at cancer care visits.

“

Qualified care providers should work
together to provide help for distress.
Types of trained providers are described
in Chapter 2, and types of help that may
be available to you are described in
Chapter 3.

I talk with people every day who
are in a place of despair. When
they call us, they’ve usually just
experienced a one-two punch.
First, they’ve been told they have
cancer. Second, after receiving
encouraging news that there is
medication that can potentially
save their lives, they are
devastated to discover the outof-pocket cost of the medication
is beyond their financial means,
because insurance won’t pay the
full amount."

NCCN experts recently added a new standard
of care. This new standard is a welcoming
and fair system for managing cancer-related
distress. Some people with cancer have
experienced prejudice and discrimination
because of their age, gender, mental health,
or other factors. Such experiences may cause
major distress and should not occur at cancer
centers.
Read this book to learn more about distress.
You may learn about help specific to your
needs. In Chapter 4, there is a list of
suggested questions to ask your care team.
You’re more likely to get the care you want by
asking questions and making decisions with
your team.

Screening for distress » When to get screened

When to get screened

Screening for distress is a key
part of cancer care. This chapter

Screening is a quick assessment of your
level of distress and what is causing distress.
Ideally, you would be screened at every
health visit because distress can occur at any
time. If that’s not possible, screening should
occur routinely and when you are likely to be
distressed. See Guide 1 for a list of times
when distress is more likely.

describes the screening process
and who can help you. Distress
screening, when paired with
getting help, improves lives.

Guide 1
Times when distress is more likely to start or worsen

During diagnosis

• A new symptom occurs, prompting testing
• Being tested for a health problem
• Finding out the diagnosis, such as cancer
• Getting a diagnosis of and living with advanced cancer
• Learning that a risk of cancer runs in your family

Before and
during treatment

• Waiting for treatment to start
• Symptoms get worse
• Having a health problem that is caused by cancer treatment
• Starting another type of treatment
• Learning that treatment didn’t work
• Being admitted to or discharged from a hospital

End of treatment

• Switching from active treatment to only survivorship care
• Getting cancer tests and other health care
• Learning that the cancer returned or worsened
• Starting end-of-life care
• Loss and grieving of family member, friend, or pet

Screening for distress » NCCN Distress Thermometer and Problem List

NCCN Distress
Thermometer and Problem
List

During testing
You may become distressed when getting
tests. An example is being distressed when
getting tests for a lump or other symptom. After
getting tested, you may need to wait for the
results, which can be hard.

The NCCN Distress Thermometer and
Problem List is a well-known screening tool
among cancer care providers. It has been
shown in many studies to work well.

The first response to learning of a cancer
diagnosis is often shock. You may also be
worried, fearful, or sad. Further testing may be
needed to learn more about the cancer that
was found.

The Distress Thermometer measures distress
on a 0 to 10 scale. Higher scores mean greater
distress.

When cancer appears cured or well-controlled,
people get tests on a regular basis. Going
to check-up visits and waiting again for test
results can be stressful. Distress is also
common if the cancer returns or worsens.

The Problem List includes problems from
different areas of life. It can be changed to fit
the hardships of a particular group of people.
The Problem List will help your care team learn
what is causing your distress and ask better
follow-up questions. You will be referred to
helpful resources.

During treatment
Waiting for treatment to start can trigger
distress. Cancer treatment may cause
distressing health problems (that is,
complications and side effects). Distress is
also common after learning that treatment
didn’t work.

If you aren’t screened for distress at
appointments, you can show your team your
responses to the NCCN Distress Thermometer
and Problem List that are on the next page.

During transitions in care
Distress can occur during transitions in care.
Such transitions include being discharged from
the hospital or finishing treatment. Shifting
from frequent treatment visits to less frequent
follow-up visits is a big change.

What to expect after
screening

Referral to experts
There are providers who have completed
special training for treating distress. Your
cancer care team may refer you to one
or more of these experts based on your
screening results. In this section, some of
the experts in distress are described. Their
qualifications and the issues they treat are
explained.

Distress screening is usually fast. A member of
your cancer care team will discuss the results
with you. Your results will be used to get you
the help you need.
Some types of distress may be managed by
your cancer care team. Your team has a wide
range of knowledge and skills. For some types
of distress, they may refer you to people with a
different set of knowledge and skills. After you
complete screening of distress, a member of
your team may:


Assess your distress further



Treat ongoing physical symptoms



Manage mild distress symptoms



Refer you to experts in distress

Chaplains
You may mark on a screening tool that you
have spiritual or religious concerns. Many
cancer centers have a chaplain on staff. If
not, your cancer care team will likely know of
one in the community. Many people who are
distressed are interested in meeting with a
chaplain.
Many chaplains are certified and have
finished a specific course of training to provide
chaplaincy services. They are certified as
either board-certified chaplains or associate
certified chaplains.

“

Chaplains help people of any faith or no faith.
They provide care for issues like:


It’s hard to deal with all of the
things that happen at once, and
not to just collapse and worry
and stress."

Social workers

Early distress screening leads to timely
management of distress. Better management
of distress in turn improves self-care and
health outcomes.

Social workers help people cope with life
challenges. They have earned either a
bachelor’s or master’s degree in social work.
Some go on to earn a doctoral degree.
Social workers can choose a specific area of
practice. Oncology social workers provide a
range of services to the cancer community.
Clinical social workers are mental health
professionals and must obtain a state license
to practice.
Social workers provide help for practical and
psychosocial problems, such as:


Housing, food, and transportation



Insurance and bills













Assistance with self-care and dependent
care
Coping with a cancer diagnosis and

Treatment decisions and advance
directives
Grief, loss, and adjusting to changes in
one’s health and body
Anxiety, trauma, depression, and thoughts
of suicide
Family, social, and cultural issues

Psychologists

Psychiatrists

Psychologists are experts in how people
think, feel, and behave. Most have a doctoral
degree. Some pursue more training in a postdoctoral fellowship, obtain board certification,
or both.

Psychiatrists are licensed medical doctors who
specialize in mental health. They are experts in
how the body and mind affect each other. They
are able to assess both physical and mental
health.

Psychologists who provide clinical services
include clinical psychologists, counseling
psychologists, health psychologists,
neuropsychologists, and school psychologists.

Most psychiatrists become board-certified in
psychiatry. They can obtain more training and
become certified in a particular area. These
areas include child and adolescent psychiatry,
geriatric psychiatry, addiction psychiatry,
and consultation-liaison psychiatry. Some
consultation-liaison psychiatrists specialize in
working with patients with cancer.

A state license is required to provide clinical
services. In some states, psychologists can
prescribe medications for mental health after
obtaining the proper education, training, and
state certification.

Psychiatrists are trained to treat mental,
emotional, and addictive disorders. Some of
the common disorders treated by psychiatrists
include depression, general anxiety, bipolar,
panic, psychotic, eating, and substance use
disorders. Psychiatrists may be particularly
helpful for mental disorders that:

Depending on their training, psychologists
provide treatment for the following:











Health issues, such as pain, weight,
sleep, sex, and taking medications as
prescribed
Cognitive problems, such as dementia
and chemo brain
Mood and anxiety problems, such as
depression, panic, and worry
Substance use, such as drugs, alcohol,
and smoking

Nurses
There are many types of nurses who care for
people with cancer. A registered nurse (RN) is
the most common type. Nurses need a state
license to practice.





Another type of nurse is an advanced practice
registered nurse (APRN). An APRN is an RN
who has earned at least a master’s degree in
nursing. APRNs can prescribe medication.





Nurses can also obtain certification in specialty
areas. Examples of certification include
oncology and psychiatry. Oncology nurses
provide a high quality of care to people with
cancer. Psychiatric nurses are mental health
experts.
Nurses are on the front line of cancer care.
They are often the first to detect that a person
is distressed. They may be the one to screen
you for distress. Across the many types of
nursing, nurses provide help for a wide range
of problems related to distress, such as:


Screening for distress is quick and should
be done routinely.
The NCCN Distress Thermometer and

Treatment for distress » Cancer care team

There is a wide range of help
for distress. This chapter is an
overview of the common types of
help for people with cancer.

Cancer education
Having cancer is very stressful. One
stressor is the need to learn about cancer.
Your care team can answer questions and
direct you to trusted educational resources.
Learning from trusted educational
resources can be very helpful and reduce
stress.

Cancer care team
The cancer care team often manages mild
distress. Mild distress is also called expected
distress. It includes worry about the future
and concerns about treatment. Your team can
manage mild distress by:




Explaining that distress is normal and
what to expect
Providing education on cancer and its
treatment



Discussing advance care planning



Prescribing medication for symptoms






There may be a learning center at your
cancer center. The learning center may
have printed materials or have access to
online resources. Health educators can
help you find trusted information.
Your cancer center may have a patient
navigator program. Patient navigators
educate. They can explain your plan of
care. They can tell you what to expect at
appointments and from treatment. They can
give you educational materials.

Preventing gaps in care between health
care providers
Teaching new or better ways to cope
Sharing information about resources at
your cancer center and in your community

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Distress During Cancer Care, 2024

NCCN has a growing library of NCCN
Guidelines for Patients®. These resources
are a good starting point from which to
learn the best options for cancer care.
Your cancer care team can provide more
information to help you make treatment
decisions. The entire library of NCCN
Guidelines for Patients can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Treatment for distress » Chaplaincy care » Social work and counseling services

Chaplaincy care

Social work and counseling
services

Many people with cancer find spirituality
or religion helpful. People use spiritual or
religious resources to cope with cancer.
Receiving spiritual support may improve
quality of life and satisfaction with care.

Social workers provide services for practical
or psychosocial problems. Patient navigators
and case managers may be of help, too.
Practical problems commonly relate to illness,
food, money, work, school, language, and
caregiving. Psychosocial problems include
mental and social effects of cancer.

A chaplain can help whether you have strong
beliefs, different beliefs, conflicted beliefs,
or no beliefs. Chaplains provide a range of
services, including:





People with practical and psychosocial
problems are often helped by social work and
counseling services. Otherwise, some of these
problems may be addressed by mental health
services, which are described in the next
section. Social workers address practical and
psychosocial problems by:

Spiritual or existential support to foster
peace and comfort
Counseling in line with your faith or beliefs
Guidance to discover spirituality or
purpose



Prayer



Connecting patients to resources



Guided meditation



Advocating on behalf of patients



Spiritual or religious rituals



Treatment for distress » Mental health services

Mental health services
There are many types of mental health
providers. The work of these providers
overlaps, but their expertise varies. You should
be referred to a provider who is a good fit
for your needs. Examples of mental health
providers include:


Clinical social workers



Psychologists



Advanced practice clinicians



Psychiatric nurses



Addiction medicine specialists



Psychiatrists

Counseling and
psychotherapy
Some people think of psychotherapy and
counseling as the same thing. Both help
people feel better, solve problems, and
achieve life goals. Both are sometimes
called “talk therapy.”
Many providers think of these as two
distinct treatments. Counseling is often
thought of as short-term help for outward
behaviors. In contrast, psychotherapy
is in-depth, sometimes long-term, help
that addresses the inner person. The
differences between the two treatments
have lessened over time.

Evaluation
The first step of care is often an evaluation
to assess the problem. Evaluations differ
between people based on the type of distress.
You may be evaluated for:


Changes in behavior



Pain, fatigue, or lack of sleep



Sexual health



Current and past mental health



Treatment history



Medical causes



Alcohol and drug use



Cognitive problems





NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Distress During Cancer Care, 2024

Counseling often focuses on a specific
issue. Examples include adjusting to
illness, grief, and stress management. The
methods used in counseling vary based on
the issue.
Psychotherapy can help with a broad
range of mental health needs. Cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on
changing thoughts and actions that
contribute to poor mental health. It can help
with depression, anxiety, pain, and fatigue
among people with cancer.
Supportive psychotherapy uses a flexible
approach to meet people’s changing needs.
It is widely used to help people with cancer.
Subtypes of this psychotherapy include
supportive-expressive, cognitive-existential,
and meaning-centered psychotherapy.

19

Treatment for distress » Mental health services

Treatment
There are many types of mental health
treatment. Based on the evaluation, your
provider will make a treatment plan tailored
to you. Mental health treatment works well
to reduce distress and improve quality of life
among people with cancer.

Psychiatric medications
Psychiatric (or psychotropic) medications
are drugs that improve mental health.
Psychiatric medications are grouped by
how they are commonly used.

Types of mental health treatment include:


Watchful waiting on level of distress



Education on mental health issues





Cognitive rehabilitation to improve brain
functioning



Behavioral management



Suicide prevention



Psychiatric medication









Antidepressants are commonly used to
treat depression. Depression is often
experienced as feeling down or irritable
most of the day for weeks. Antidepressants
are also used to treat anxiety and certain
physical problems like pain.

Psychotherapy or counseling; also called
“talk therapy”

Anxiolytics may be used with psychotherapy
to treat anxiety. Key features of anxiety
include severe fear or worry, panic attacks,
and strong behavioral impulses.

Medications for drug detoxification and to
prevent relapse

Mood stabilizers treat bipolar-related
disorders. The key feature of bipolar
disorders is an episode of elevated mood
called mania.

Electroconvulsive therapy
Hospital care, residential treatment, and
specialized programs

Antipsychotics treat psychotic disorders.
Features of psychotic disorders include
perceiving unreal sensations, fixed false
beliefs, and disorganized thinking.

Exercise
Integrative (or complementary) therapy
like yoga or meditation

Antipsychotics treat other health
conditions, too. They may be used to
treat anxiety if other medications did not
work. Antipsychotics are also used to
treat delirium—a short-term disturbance in
mental abilities. Delirium occurs in people
with advanced cancer. It can also be
triggered by some types of medicines.
