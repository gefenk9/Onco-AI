About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Survivorship, Version 1.2024 — March 29, 2024.

People with cancer are living
longer than they did in the past.

NCCN Guidelines for
Patients

They are surviving, and their
needs have changed. Survivorship

Many books in the library of NCCN
Guidelines for Patients cover aspects of
survivorship care.

care includes recovering from
cancer and promoting health.

•

Most NCCN Guidelines for Patients
focus on a type of cancer. They
often describe unique details about
surveillance and supportive care for
that cancer type.

•

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients for
Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer
address the survivorship needs of
people ages 15 through 39 years.

•

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients
for Palliative Care address patient,
family, and caregiver needs for
comprehensive care during cancer
treatment as well as at the end of life.

•

This book is part of a two-part book
series on survivorship. Read the
other survivorship book to learn
about common cancer-related late
and long-term effects.

Who is a cancer survivor?
Cancer survivors are people living with cancer
and those free of cancer. Survivorship starts
at the time of cancer diagnosis and continues
through life.
Some people do not like or identify with the
term survivor. It is not meant to be a label.
Its purpose is to identify the community of
people with a history of cancer. Having a
common term is useful for improving the care
of survivors.

What is survivorship care?
Survivorship care improves health, wellness,
and quality of life. Its focus is on the wide and
lasting impact of cancer and its treatment. It
addresses physical and mental health, health
behaviors, professional and personal identity,
and finances, just to name a few.

1 About survivorship » Why is healthy living important?

Your providers may create and review a
survivorship plan with you. You will be given a
schedule of follow-up visits. Possible cancerrelated late effects may be included in the
plan. Your providers may refer you to other
specialists and community resources.

Standards of survivorship care include:








Routine testing for the return of a
cancer (surveillance) and new cancers
(screening)
Routine testing for late and long-term
effects of cancer and treatment

Why is healthy living
important?

Prevention of harmful effects of cancer
and treatment
Management of cancer-related challenges
including referral to specialists



Coordinated care between providers

Planning for ongoing survivorship care

You can improve your health and quality of
life with healthy living. Depending on the
type of cancer, healthy living lowers the risk
of recurrence and death. NCCN experts
encourage all survivors to adopt a healthy
lifestyle.

To plan survivorship care, your cancer or
primary care provider will assess your needs.
Ongoing care requires that you see one or
both providers at least once a year. They will
review your cancer care, health history, current
abilities, and medications.

This book can help you set and achieve goals
for healthy living. It is written for survivors with
an onset of cancer in adulthood. It explains
expert recommendations that are based on

"Move every day, eat healthy
foods, and reduce your
stress. Watch funny movies
and hug loved ones often.
Spend time in nature. Never
lose hope!"

Move for better health

Move more! Physical activity is
safe and improves the health

Cancer and its treatment may limit the physical
activity of cancer survivors. Physical activity
is any movement you make that burns more
calories than when you’re at rest. It includes
many types of activities. With the right support,
many cancer survivors can increase their
physical activity.

of most cancer survivors. This
chapter will help you to be more
active.

Physical activity improves health and wellbeing. It may even help stop some cancers
from returning and extend life, but more
research is needed. The known benefits of
physical activity among survivors are listed in

Guide 2.

Guide 2
Benefits of physical activity among cancer survivors
Improved cardiovascular
fitness

Cardiovascular fitness is how well your body takes in and
transports oxygen to tissue.

Greater muscle strength

Muscle strength is how well you can move or lift objects.

Better balance

Balance is how well you can control your body’s position.

Healthier body composition

Body composition is the amount of fat, muscle, bone, and
water in your body.

Less fatigue

Fatigue is being tired despite getting enough sleep.

Better emotional well-being

Emotional well-being is a balance between positive and
negative feelings and being happy and satisfied with life.

Improved quality of life

Quality of life is your belief that you have a good life.

Lower risk of cardiovascular
events

Cardiovascular events are medical conditions that can damage
the heart.

Activity goals

Before starting any new physical activity, talk
to your cancer or primary care provider. They
can provide guidance and may refer you to a
specialist. Some people also receive support
from a provider trained in exercise, such as:

Your plan for physical activity should be based
on your abilities and goals. It can be tailored
to how often and how intensely you want to
be active. You can also help select the type of
physical activity. Work with your provider to set
short- and long-term goals. General goals for
physical activity for cancer survivors are listed
in Guide 3.

Move more and be inactive less
A person can be physically active but still have
long periods of inactivity. Inactivity is resting
while sitting, reclining, or lying down. Lots of
inactivity is linked to poor outcomes. It raises
the risk of new cancers and death among
cancer survivors. It is linked to depressed
mood and lower quality of life.

Exercise providers can receive training to work
with cancer survivors. The American College
of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and American
Physical Therapy Association (APTA) offer
specialty training. Search for an ACSM- or
APTA-certified provider near you.

Your general goals are to move more and not
to be inactive for long periods.

To help you plan routine physical activity, your
provider may perform an assessment. The
assessment may include:


Readiness to be physically active



Prior and current physical activity



Barriers to physical activity



Physical health and treatment



Mental health and treatment

Strengthen and stretch muscles
Strengthening and stretching muscles is just
as important as exercise. Having stronger
muscles may help you to do self-care
activities, prevent falling, and have higher bone
density. Stretching increases flexibility, which is
an important part of physical fitness.
All major muscle groups should be
strengthened and stretched.

You may have barriers to getting enough
physical activity. You may not have time. You
may not have space in your home. You may
not know what physical activities are good
and safe for you. Your care team can help you
overcome these challenges.

Recommended routine
Strengthen your muscles with resistance
training 2 to 3 times a week. Resistance
training may include using weights, elastic
bands, or your own body weight to work your
muscles.

General goals of
physical activity
A general goal is to do physical activity at
a moderate or vigorous intensity during the
week.

Contact a trained provider if you’re new to
resistance training. You’ll be given exercises to
do. It is common to do 2 to 3 sets of exercises
and 10 to 15 repetitions of each exercise
per set. Rest 2 to 3 minutes between sets.
Resistance may be increased if the exercises
become too easy.

3 At least 150 minutes of moderate-

intensity activity is recommended with
an ultimate goal of 300 minutes. That’s
at least 2½ to 5 hours a week.

3 If you choose vigorous-intensity activity,
75 minutes a week is recommended.

Do stretching exercises on at least 2 of the
days when you’re not exercising the major
muscles.

3 You could also do a mix of moderateand vigorous-intensity activity spread
out over the course of the week.

Core exercises and balance training are
recommended for everyone, especially older
survivors and if you’re at risk for falling.

3 All exercise should start with a

light-intensity aerobic warm-up and
stretching.

Increase your heart rate
Any physical activity is better than none. To
further improve your fitness, do activities that
increase your heart rate. Among the 3 groups
of physical activity, moderate and vigorous
activity get the heart pumping.






Light activity is movement that doesn’t
cause any change in breathing
Moderate activity is movement during
which you can talk but can’t sing
Vigorous activity is movement that makes
it hard to talk because you’re breathing
hard

Examples of physical activity are listed in

Cancer-related challenges

Ostomy
An ostomy is a surgically created change in
the way stool or urine leaves the body. A stoma
is a hole created in the wall of the abdomen
through which stool or urine passes out. You
can be active while having a stoma.

Cancer and its treatment can make physical
activity challenging. Don’t get discouraged.
Talk to your care provider about ways to be
active. If you have one of the health issues
in this section, NCCN experts recommend
working with a trained professional when
starting an exercise program.




Lymphedema
Lymphedema is a buildup of bodily fluid called
lymph. It should not stop you from being
physically active. Progressive weight training
under supervision and physical activity are safe.












Work with a lymphedema specialist
and trained exercise professional when
resistance training involves limbs with or
at risk for lymphedema.



Full use of your limbs and range-ofmotion exercises can maintain strength
and flexibility. Exercise your arms and
shoulders when possible.



Increase your strength with resistance
training in small steps. Compression
garments may be needed during
resistance training.

Slowly increase strength with resistance
training that is overseen by a trained
provider.
Perform core exercises that have been
revised to reduce pressure on the
abdomen.
Don’t strain your belly (like you would in a
Valsalva maneuver) since you are at risk
for hernias.
Use an ostomy protector during contact
sports or when there’s risk for injury to the
ostomy.
Stay hydrated during physical activity,
especially if you have an ileostomy.

Prosthesis or limb amputation
If you wear a prosthesis or have had a limb
amputated, consider the following:

Get checked regularly for the start
or worsening of lymphedema. Stop
exercising and see a lymphedema
specialist if lymphedema worsens.






NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Survivorship Care for Healthy Living, 2024

Empty the ostomy bag before exercising.

14

Consult with a trained provider, such as
a physical therapist, to make a plan that
works for you.
Be sure to use your prosthesis properly!
Use your cane, brace, or walker as
needed to ensure you don’t fall.

2 Physical activity » Tips for achieving goals

Tips for achieving goals

Peripheral neuropathy
Peripheral neuropathy is a type of nerve
damage. It can be caused by cancer or its
treatment. Symptoms include numbness, pain,
tingling, weakness, and dizziness.












Physical activity is a life-long pursuit. It takes
effort and support to reach and maintain goals.
There are many strategies you can use to
achieve success.

Get your stability, balance, and gait
checked before starting exercise.



Do balance training with a trained
professional if it would be helpful.



Use a stationary bike, do water exercises,
or do yoga if walking is unsafe. Wear
water shoes or protective footwear to
prevent skin breakdown.



Tell your care provider if you have any
discomfort when using hand-held weights.



Use weights with a soft covering or
padded gloves if helpful.



If you’re concerned about dropping
weights, consider using weight machines
or resistance bands.





Don’t do exercises that place stress
on weak bones. Work with a trained
professional for weight-bearing exercises
to improve bone density.
Reduce your risk of falling.
Contact your cancer care team if bone
pain starts.
Ask your care team if taking vitamin D
would help you.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Survivorship Care for Healthy Living, 2024

Schedule movement breaks regularly and
stand or move while talking on the phone,
for example.
Find support from an exercise buddy or
class. Work with an exercise specialist.
Use a fitness device or phone app to track
your activity.

Oftentimes we do not want to be
outside or go to the gym. A big help
was online exercise videos. You
can walk a mile and do a cardio
exercise, just in a few minutes
from your home. These were
instrumental in allowing me to get
my exercise from the comforts of
my home—at my own pace."

Bone loss and cancer in the bone can make
bones weak. Physical activity can be safe if
you take these steps:

Work with your care providers to make a
plan for physical activity that is best for
you.
A plan for physical activity should include
goals to move more and be less inactive.
Do physical activity that increases your

What are calories?
Dietary calories (calories for short) are a
measurement of how much energy food
provides. You will gain weight if you consume
more calories than your body needs. You will
lose weight if you consume fewer calories than
your body needs.

A Nutrition Facts label is a label with numbers
on packaged food, like cereal or potato chips.
This label lists the calories and nutrients
per serving. Read the Nutrition Facts label
when choosing food. Take note of how many
servings are in a package.

Nutrition Facts label
These boxes appear on many packaged foods in the United States. Information contained in
these boxes includes serving size information, calories, nutrients present, and percentage of
daily values. Values that are 20% or more are considered high.

What are nutrients?
Nutrients are substances in food that your
body uses to live. Your body can’t make some
of these, so you’ll need to get them by eating
food. There are 5 main essential nutrients
that are listed on Nutrition Facts labels and
described in Guide 5.

The “% daily value” on the Nutrition Facts label
tells if a nutrient is high or low per serving. A
daily value of 5% or less is low. A daily value of
20% or more is high.

Guide 5
Nutrients

Your body needs fats for many
reasons, including to grow cells,
provide energy, and keep warm.

There are 4 types of fats:
• Monounsaturated fat
• Polyunsaturated fat
• Saturated fat
• Trans fat
Unsaturated fats are good for your health.

Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are the main
source of energy for your body.

There are 3 main types:
• Fiber
• Starches
• Sugar
Fiber and unrefined starches are good for
your health.

Proteins

Your body needs proteins to
build and repair body tissue,
fight infection, and provide
energy.

There are 9 essential proteins that you
can only get from food. Foods with
proteins that are low in bad fats and salt
(sodium) are good for your health.

Your body needs vitamins and
minerals to boost the immune
system, support normal growth,
and help cells and organs work.

Some examples of commonly needed
vitamins and minerals include:
• Calcium
• Potassium

Foods to eat

Fruit
There are thousands of types of fruit. Fruit can
be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried. Fruit can
also be squeezed or blended to make juice.
Squeezed fruit juice lacks fiber, but a drink of
100% squeezed fruit juice counts as fruit.

NCCN experts recommend eating the foods
described below. This will help you live a
healthier life.

Eat plant-based foods

Whole grains
Grains are seeds from grasses. They include
wheat, rye, rice, oats, cornmeal, and barley.
Food made from whole grains has all the
parts of the seeds. Refined grains have had
some parts of the seeds removed. Food made
from whole grains is recommended to ensure
healthy living as it provides fiber, vitamins,
minerals, and other nutrients.

In general, a healthy diet is rich in plant
sources. Most of your plant-based foods
should be vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole
grains. Other plant-based foods are soy, nuts,
seeds, or oils.
Vegetables
Vegetables include dark green vegetables,
starchy vegetables, red and orange
vegetables, legumes (beans and peas), and
other types. Vegetables can be fresh, canned,
frozen, or dried. They can be squeezed or
blended to make juice. Squeezed vegetable
juice lacks fiber, but a drink of 100% squeezed
vegetable juice counts as a vegetable.

Soy
Soy foods are made from soybeans, which are
also called edamame. Other examples of soybased foods are tofu and tempeh. According to
recent research, eating up to 3 servings of soy
a day may be beneficial for cancer survivors.

Eat a diet of mostly
nutrient-rich, plant-based
foods.

Foods to limit

Eat nutrient-rich foods
Avoid empty-calorie foods that have many
calories and few nutrients. Instead, eat foods
that are rich in nutrients compared to their
calories. Nutrient-rich foods will help you get
the nutrients you need. No single food has
every nutrient, so learn which combinations of
foods have the nutrients you need.

Red meat
Eat limited amounts of red meat. Beef, pork,
and lamb are red meats. NCCN experts
recommend eating no more than 18 ounces of
cooked red meat a week. This is about 1.125
pounds or the size of an average paperback
book.

Healthy fats
Recommended sources of fat include plant
sources, such as olive or canola oil, avocados,
seeds and nuts, and cold-water fish. Coldwater fish include mackerel, salmon, herring,
tuna, and sardines. These listed fats should be
chosen over saturated fats and eaten in small
amounts when trying to lose weight.

Processed foods
Processed food is food that has been changed
from its natural state. There are classes of
processed foods.


Healthy carbohydrates
Recommended sources of carbohydrates
include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and
legumes (beans).



Healthy proteins
Recommended sources of protein are poultry,
fish, legumes, low-fat dairy foods, eggs, and
nuts.

Processed foods have added fats, sugar,
or salt.
Ultra-processed foods typically have at
least 5 ingredients and have artificial
colors, flavors, and preservatives.

Limit eating processed and ultra-processed
foods, especially those high in fats and sugar.
Highly processed foods are linked to a greater
risk of cancer. These foods include chips,
cookies, candy bars, desserts, processed
baked goods, sugary cereals, and fried foods.

Vitamins and minerals
Recommended sources of vitamins and
minerals include low-fat or non-fat yogurt,
leafy greens (spinach, kale), whole grains, and
cashews.

Cancer survivors should limit eating processed
meats. Ham, hot dogs, deli cuts, bacon,
and sausage are processed meats. Eating
processed meats is linked with a greater
chance of colorectal and stomach cancers.

Sugar
Limit eating refined sugar. Refined sugar is
sugar that is extracted from foods. When
reading labels, look for refined sugars called
high-fructose corn syrup, cane sugar, cane

juice, rice syrup, molasses, caramel, and
glucose, maltose, or dextrose.

NCCN experts advise that most cancer
survivors do not take supplements. Right
now, there is no clear proof that they improve
cancer prevention and control, or stop
recurrence. If you do take supplements, they
do not replace the need for a healthy diet.

NCCN experts recommend eating less than 6
teaspoons of sugar a day on a 2,000-calorie
diet. A teaspoon is about the size of the tip of
your finger (joint to tip).
Refined sugar is in many foods and drinks, so
take notice when consuming:


Soft drinks and sports drinks



Some breakfast cereals



Sweets and baked goods



Canned goods



Preserves, jams, and nut butters



Low-fat foods



Ketchup, salad dressing, and pasta sauce

Some supplements can interfere with other
medicines including chemotherapy. Let your
health care team know if you are taking or
want to take supplements.

What are supplements?
Supplements provide more nutrients than what
is in the food you eat. They are taken by mouth
in the form of a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid.
Supplements are not medicines. They are not
intended to cure, treat, or prevent disease.
There are several common types of
supplements.

Alcohol
Cancer survivors should limit or not drink
alcohol at all. Low levels of alcohol are related
to a lower risk of cancer. Survivors of liver,
esophageal, kidney, and head and neck
cancers should not drink alcohol due to a
higher chance of death.

also have poor metabolic health.
This chapter explains strategies
to control your weight and
metabolism.

Together, your care providers will track your
body mass index (BMI) and metabolic health.
They will also track your body composition.
Body composition is often divided into fat and
fat-free mass.

Many cancer survivors experience weight
changes. Some survivors lose weight. Other
survivors gain weight. Unintentional weight
changes may worsen a survivor’s health and
quality of life. This may impact the cancer
coming back. To improve outcomes, there are
3 goals for cancer survivors.


Achieve a healthy weight



Maintain healthy weight



Strive for metabolic health

BMI
Body mass index (BMI) is a quick measure of
body fat based on height and weight. It is used
to identify weight status.







A BMI of 30 or more is considered obese

In-depth assessment

A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered
overweight

If your test results are of concern, your
provider will perform an in-depth assessment.
The assessment will be used to make a plan
to improve results. The assessment will cover
many factors.

A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a
healthy weight for most people
A BMI of less than 18.5 is considered
underweight

BMI is a helpful but imperfect measure. It may
be too imprecise for people who are muscular.
Measuring the size of the waistline may be
better.

Metabolic health
Metabolism is the chemical processes in
the body that are needed to live. A healthy
metabolism lowers the chance of heart

There are many strategies for weight
management. They differ based on whether
the goal is to gain, maintain, or lose weight.
See Guide 6 for a list of key strategies.

Strategies to maintain weight

To gain weight, you need to consume more
calories. Eat more often and eat foods high in
calories and nutrients. Also, don’t drink while
eating. Drinking may limit how much you eat.
Get the help you need. Registered dieticians
can provide information, guidance, and
support.

It is important to make maintaining a normal
weight a lifetime goal. Weigh yourself every
day. Otherwise, you may be unaware of losing
or gaining weight.
To maintain weight, be careful not to eat too
many foods that are high in calories. Also, be
careful not to overeat or deprive yourself of
food. Following serving size standards and
using portion-control plates may be helpful.

Strategies to lose weight
Stay focused and weigh yourself every day.
Don’t feel bad if your weight is higher on one
day. Instead, look for trends in weight change.
Slower weight loss is healthier than fast weight
loss.

An immune response is a defensive reaction
by your body to a germ. The immune system

how to prevent getting infections.
It also explains which type of
vaccines to get and when.

Immune responses can be weak during
several types of cancer treatment. The time for
the immune system to recover after treatment
varies between treatments. Read Guide 7
for a list of cancer-related factors that can
weaken the immune system.

Weakened immune
response
Cancer survivors may be at risk for infection.
Many have a poor immune response due to
cancer, other health problems, or treatment.

What is an infection?
An infection is defined by three key features:


A germ (microbe) enters your body

Guide 7
Cancer-related immune suppressors



The germ multiplies inside your body

Blood cancers and cancers that spread to bone



The germ worsens your health

Splenectomy

An example of an infection in people is
chickenpox. Chickenpox is caused by a virus
called the varicella-zoster virus. When the
virus has multiplied, it causes an itchy skin
rash and flu-like symptoms. It may reactivate
later in life as shingles.

How to protect yourself

Avoid getting infected
One strategy is to avoid having contact with
germs. Don’t go to busy indoor places or use
crowded transportation if possible. If you can't
avoid crowds, wearing a mask might help.
Don’t touch animal feces or fluids, which can
transmit disease. Avoid travel to high-risk
areas. If the water is unsafe, drink bottled
water and don't use ice.

Your cancer or primary care provider will
assess your risk of infection and a poor
immune response. Your risk mainly depends
on three things:





Your health history
The type of cancer treatment and time
since treatment ended

If you have contact with germs, washing
yourself is very important. Wash your hands
before and after having close contact with
people and animals. If you can’t wash your
hands, use hand sanitizer with at least 60%
alcohol.

Exposure to germs

Based on the assessment, your provider will
present a plan to prevent infections. Ways to
prevent infections are listed in Guide 8.

Guide 8
Preventing infections among cancer survivors
Animal care

• Wash your hands after handling animal feces
• Avoid animal feces and fluids if you have a weak immune system

Travel

• Get vaccinated before traveling to high-risk areas
• Take medicines that prevent infections before traveling to high-risk areas
• Learn how to prevent infections from germs in water, air, and animals

Gardening

• Wear gloves to avoid cuts
• Wear a mask to avoid cells called spores

Hand hygiene

• Wash your hands often to prevent getting and spreading germs
• If you can’t wash your hands, use hand sanitizer with at least 60%
alcohol

Antimicrobial

• Take prescribed medicine to prevent infections

Vaccines

• Stay up-to-date with getting vaccines

5 Infections » How to protect yourself

“

When gardening, wear gloves to prevent skin
cuts, which increase the risk of infection. Wear
shoes outdoors. Wear facial masks to reduce
infections of cells called spores.

While cancer survivors may
never return to their life exactly
as it was before, part of their
new lives, hopefully, can be the
mutual support of each other
and support of patients currently
battling cancer.”

Get antimicrobial prophylaxis
Antimicrobials are drugs that kill or stunt the
growth of germs. Based on your risk, your
provider may prescribe an antimicrobial to
prevent an infection. Antimicrobials are grouped
by which type of organisms they attack.



Antibiotics treat bacterial infections
(fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin,
ciprofloxacin)
Antifungals treat fungal infections
(fluconazole, posaconazole)
Antivirals treat viral infections

STOP GERMS! WASH YOUR HANDS
Keeping hands clean is one of the most important things
we can do to stop the spread of germs and be healthy.

Hand hygiene
Proper hand hygiene
is one way of
preventing infection.
It can be done with
thorough hand
washing and use of
hand sanitizer.

1

5 Infections » Safe vaccines for survivors

Safe vaccines for survivors

Your provider will assess which vaccines you
need, and which are safe for you. Vaccines for
cancer survivors are listed in Guide 9.

Vaccines are biological agents that prevent
diseases. They contain whole germs, parts of
a germ, or a product of a germ. Many vaccines
safely prevent infections in cancer survivors.
Preventing infections can save lives and
protect against some cancers.

Tell your provider if you are allergic to
vaccines, medications, or food. Such allergies
may impact which vaccines you can receive.
Before vaccination, your immune system
should be as strong as possible. Vaccines may
not work well if your immune system is weak.

Unfortunately, many survivors do not get
vaccinated.

Guide 9
Vaccines for cancer survivors

Non-live vaccines for
all survivors

• Flu vaccine every year (inactivated or recombinant)
• Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis vaccine
• Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) for shingles if you are 50 years
of age or over
• COVID-19 vaccine
• HPV vaccine if not received before and you are 45 years of age or
under
• Pneumococcal vaccine if you are 65 years of age or over
• Hepatitis B vaccine if you are 60 years of age or under

Non-live vaccines for
survivors at high risk
of certain infections

• Pneumococcal vaccine if you are 19 years of age or over
• Hepatitis B vaccine if you are over 60 years of age
• Hepatitis A vaccine
• Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine
• Meningococcal vaccine
• Other vaccines based on travel or risk of exposure

Live vaccines to avoid
or take with caution
if immune system is

• MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)
• Oral typhoid
• Rotavirus
• Yellow fever
• Nasal flu vaccine
• Varicella zoster (single or combined with MMR)

5 Infections » Safe vaccines for survivors

Timing of vaccinations

The number of immune cells (white blood
cells) in your body should be normal or stable.
You must not have any ongoing infection.

The immune system is weak during some
cancer treatments. It may remain weak for a
time after treatment ends. Vaccines are less
safe when your immune system is weakened.
If you need a vaccine, get it when your immune
system is as close to normal as possible.

Your provider will assess if a vaccine is safe for
you based on your health. Safety also depends
on the type of vaccine and the time since your
cancer treatment ended.

Get non-live vaccines:

Types of vaccines



Live vaccines contain an entire germ
that has been weakened (attenuated). They
create a strong immune response to the
real germ. Live vaccines may cause major
health problems in people with weak immune
systems. Do not get live vaccines unless
approved by a vaccine or cancer expert.

or




If you have a weak immune system, people
who have close contact with you should not get
live vaccines. If they do, keep your distance for
2 to 6 weeks depending on the vaccine. Avoid
contact with feces and urine of children for 4
weeks after they get a rotavirus vaccine.







Inactivated vaccines contain a germ that
has been killed.

At least 6 months after a hematopoietic
cell transplant, such as a bone marrow
transplant
At least 6 months after chemotherapy
and the last dose of anti–B-cell antibody
therapy

Get live vaccines:

Subunit vaccines contain a part of a
germ. Subtypes include recombinant,
polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines.
Toxoid vaccines contain a diseasecausing protein from the germ. They
cause a strong immune response if you
are exposed to the real germ.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Survivorship Care for Healthy Living, 2024

At least 3 months after chemotherapy or
radiation therapy when possible

If needed, you may be able to receive some
vaccines during cancer treatment. An example
is an inactivated flu shot. If you had a blood
stem cell transplant, a flu shot should be
delayed until at least 4 months after the
transplant.

Non-live vaccines are safe for cancer
survivors. There are 3 types:


At least 2 weeks before cancer treatment



At least 4 weeks before treatment or



At least 3 months after chemotherapy

Do not get live viral vaccines after a transplant
