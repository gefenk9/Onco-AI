About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Version 7.2024 —
June 26, 2024.

1 Lung cancer basics » What is NSCLC?

If you’re reading this, you or

Lung cancer cells grow out of control. They
don’t die when they should and make many
new cancer cells, which become tumors.

someone you care for might
have non-small cell lung cancer

Lung cancer cells also don’t stay in place.
They can break away from a tumor, spread
outside the lung, and form more tumors.

(NSCLC). It’s the most common
type of lung cancer. In this
chapter, you’ll learn what this type

NSCLC is a type of lung carcinoma

of cancer is and what it means if

Almost all lung cancers are carcinomas (karsin-OH-mas). Lung carcinomas form from cells
that line the airways of the lungs. The airways
inside the lungs are the bronchi, bronchioli,
and alveoli.

it’s early or locally advanced.

What is NSCLC?

NSCLC is the most common lung
carcinoma. Other lung carcinomas are
neuroendocrine tumors. Information on lung
neuroendocrine tumors can be found at

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a type
of lung cancer. Another type of lung cancer
is small cell lung cancer, but it is a different
cancer covered in another book.

Airways of the lungs
The air you breathe moves through a
series of airways. It travels down your
throat and through your windpipe
(trachea). The windpipe splits into
two airways called bronchi. Inside
the lung, each bronchus divides into
smaller airways called the bronchioli.
At the end of the bronchioli are sacs
called alveoli. Oxygen is transferred
from air into the blood in the alveoli.

NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Cancers that have spread to the
lungs are not lung cancers. For
example, stomach cancer that
has spread to the lungs is still
stomach cancer.

There are several types of NSCLC

lung cancer are often written with Roman
numerals—stages I (1), II (2), III (3), and
IV (4). We will be listing stages as 1, 2, 3, and
4 to make the stages easier to read.

Each type of NSCLC forms from a particular
kind of cell. Below are common types of
NSCLC:






At diagnosis, stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3
cancers have grown from the airway into lung
tissue. Some have spread to nearby diseasefighting structures called lymph nodes.

Adenocarcinoma (A-deh-noh-KAR-sihNOH-muh) often forms from cells that line
the alveoli and make mucus. This is the
most common type of NSCLC.
Large cell carcinoma forms from
any of the large cells that are found
throughout the airways.

Stage 1 is early NSCLC. In general, stage 2
and stage 3 are considered locally advanced.

Squamous cell carcinoma (squaymous) forms from cells that line the
bronchi.

Cancer stages and metastasis
Some early and locally advanced cancers
spread to the tissue lining around the lung or
to other organs after diagnosis and then are
called metastatic cancer. Stage 4 cancer is
metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis.

What is early and locally
advanced NSCLC?

Information about metastatic NSCLC is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Early and locally advanced lung cancers have
not spread to the tissue lining around the lung
or to other organs. The difference between
early and locally advanced cancer is mainly
based on the cancer stage.

Cancer stages 1, 2, and 3
A cancer stage describes the extent of lung
cancer in the body. The main stages of

good fit for you. Learn more about clinical trials
in Chapter 3.

There’s no single treatment for NSCLC that’s
best for everyone. The best treatment is the
treatment that’s right for you. The following
chapters explain expert recommendations that
are based on the latest research and current
practices at leading cancer centers.

Advocate for yourself
You are an important member of your cancer
care team. Discuss the recommendations in
this book with your team. Together, you can
make a care plan that’s best for you.

Often, multiple treatments are
used to get the best results

There is a list of suggested questions in
Chapter 9 to ask your team. You’re more likely
to get the care you want by asking questions
and making decisions with your team.

Some people with early or locally advanced
NSCLC have surgery to remove cancer from
the body. Other types of cancer treatment are
used with surgery to improve results. Read
Chapter 5 to learn more about treatment with
surgery.

Key points


If you can’t have surgery, there are other
good options. Some early cancers are treated
with radiation therapy, which is explained in
Chapter 6. Other cancers are treated with
2 types of treatments called chemoradiation.
Chemoradiation is discussed in Chapter 7.



Supportive care addresses the
challenges of cancer



Supportive care has been shown to extend
and enhance life for people with lung cancer.
Tell your care team about your symptoms and
other needs to get the best supportive care for
you. More information on supportive care can
be found throughout this book.

Clinical trials offer hope to all
people with lung cancer
Clinical trials are a type of health research that
tests new ways of fighting cancer. Ask your
care team if there is a clinical trial that is a

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a
cancer of lung cells. Cancers that spread
to the lungs are not lung cancer.
Early and locally advanced NSCLCs are
cancers that have grown from the airways
into lung tissue, and some have spread to
lymph nodes.
Treatment for NSCLC varies based on
what is best for each person. When
possible, surgery is used for primary
treatment.

2 Lung nodules » Lung nodule experts

Many people have small masses

Your care team should consist of members
from different fields of medicine, including the
following board-certified experts:

of tissue in their lungs, called
nodules. A nodule may have been



found in your lung by chance. This
chapter discusses how experts



decide if this nodule is cancer.



Lung nodule experts

A thoracic radiologist is a doctor
who’s an expert in imaging of the chest.
Imaging takes pictures of the inside of the
body.
A thoracic surgeon is a doctor who is
an expert in operations within the chest.

To decide if a nodule is cancer, your team will
do the following:

Most lung nodules are not cancer, but some
are. Nodules can be caused by cancer,
infections, scar tissue, and other health
conditions. When a nodule found by chance
seems to be cancer, it takes a team of experts
to decide the best course of care.






Lung nodule
A lung nodule is a small
mass of tissue in the
lung. Many people have
lung nodules. Most
are not cancer. When
nodules are found
by imaging, you may
receive more scans to
assess if the nodule is
cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024

A pulmonologist is a doctor who’s an
expert in lung diseases.

9

Assess your risk for lung cancer.
Review lung images and request more
imaging if there may be cancer.
Perform a procedure called a biopsy, if
needed.

2 Lung nodules » Risk for lung cancer

Researchers are studying ways to prevent
lung cancer caused by smoking. Treatments
to prevent cancer are called chemopreventive
agents. Ask your care team if there is a clinical
trial on preventing lung cancer that you could
join.

If the nodule is unlikely cancer, your team
may refer you for lung cancer screening.
Lung cancer screening is for people at high
risk for lung cancer. Information on lung
cancer screening is available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Cancer-causing agents
You are more likely to get lung cancer,
especially if you smoke, after exposure to:

Risk for lung cancer

Radon



Asbestos



Anyone can get lung cancer, but some people
are more at risk. A risk factor is anything that
increases your chance of lung cancer. Risk
factors for lung cancer are listed in Guide 1.




Some people with many risk factors never get
lung cancer. Some people with no risk factors
do get lung cancer. Experts are still learning
why one person gets lung cancer and another
does not.

Arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium,
and nickel
Coal smoke, soot, silica, and diesel fumes
Air pollution by fine particulates, ozone,
nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide

Guide 1
Risk factors for lung cancer

Tobacco smoke

Current or past smoking

The biggest risk factor for lung cancer is
smoking tobacco. There are more than 50
compounds in tobacco smoke known to cause
cancer. The risk grows the more times a
person smokes and the longer they smoke.

Exposure to cancer-causing agents
Advanced age
Certain cancers and cancer treatments

Exposure to second-hand smoke increases
the risk of lung cancer. Secondhand smoke
is the smoke exhaled by another person and
the smoke from the burning end of tobacco
products.

Age

Other lung diseases

As you age, you are more likely to get lung
cancer. In recent years, half of the people who
were diagnosed with lung cancer were over
71 years of age. Only 7 out of 100 people with
lung cancer were under the age of 55 years.

Some lung diseases can increase the risk of
lung cancer. There’s a strong link between
lung cancer and these diseases:


Previous cancers and cancer
treatment


The risk for lung cancer increases after having
some types of cancer:






Having one type of lung cancer increases
your risk for other types of lung cancers.



If you had lymphoma, you are more likely
to get lung cancer.

Lung nodules are often found by chance
on medical images for an unrelated health
problem. They may be first detected by a chest
x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or
positron emission tomography (PET) scan.
Lung nodules on imaging are sometimes
called spots or shadows.

If you’ve had another smoking-related
cancer, such as head and neck cancer,
your risk for lung cancer is increased.

Your radiologist will review the images to
decide if the nodule may be cancer. Important
results are the features of the nodule,
abnormal lung tissue, and PET hot spots.

Receiving radiation therapy in the chest
increases the risk of having lung cancer
years after treatment, especially if you
smoke.

Features of the nodule

Treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma with an
alkylating cancer drug increases the risk
of lung cancer, too.

Nodules caused by cancer have specific
features. They aren’t likely to have calcium
and compared to nodules without cancer, often
have these features:

Family history of lung cancer
Your risk for lung cancer is increased if your
birth parent, sibling, or child has had lung
cancer. Your risk is even higher if lung cancer
occurred at a young age or among multiple
relatives.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024

Pulmonary fibrosis is major scarring of
lung tissue that makes it hard to breathe.

Signs of lung cancer

Some cancer treatments also increase the risk
of lung cancer:


Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) makes breathing hard because
the lung tissue is damaged or there’s too
much mucus.

11



Rough edges and odd shapes



Fast growth and large size



High density

2 Lung nodules » Planning follow-up care » Types of follow-up care

Abnormal lung tissue

The first follow-up will be based on the nodule
features seen on the baseline scan. The
next follow-up, if needed, will be based on
comparing your baseline scan to the most
current scan.

Besides nodules, imaging may show other
abnormal findings. It may show tissue
inflammation and tissue scarring.

PET hot spots

Types of follow-up care

Cancerous nodules often appear as hot spots
on PET. Before the scan, a radiotracer will be
injected into one of your veins. Cancer cells
take in more of the tracer than normal cells
and show up as bright (hot) spots on the scan.
Multiple health problems can cause hot spots,
so the cause often needs to be confirmed by
other testing.

The three types of follow-up care for lung
nodules are CT scan, PET/CT scan, and
biopsy.
Why get scans? Scans are less invasive
than a biopsy.

You may get low-dose CT (LDCT) or a
diagnostic CT. LDCT uses much less radiation
than a standard scan. It also does not require
contrast, which is a substance that makes
clearer images. LDCT is preferred by NCCN
experts for cancer screening unless a clearer
image is needed.

Planning follow-up care
After a lung nodule is found, follow-up care
is sometimes scheduled. It is not needed for
most lung nodules. It is scheduled when a
nodule may be cancer and more tests are
needed. Your care team will make a follow-up
care plan specific to you.

Often, one CT scan doesn’t clearly show
whether a nodule is cancer. Instead, CT needs
to be repeated over time.

Nodule features

A PET/CT scan after a CT scan may find
cancer quicker than repeated CT scans. PET/
CT is also useful for showing signs of cancer
spreading in the body. Your whole body will be
scanned, or the scan will extend from above
your neck down to the middle of your thighs.

NCCN recommendations for follow-up care
are based on two important baseline nodule
features:




Nodule density described as either
solid or subsolid
Nodule size measured in millimeters
(mm)

Why get a biopsy? If your team strongly
suspects cancer, a biopsy may save time by
allowing you to start cancer treatment earlier.
A biopsy removes a small amount of tissue or
fluid for cancer testing. More information on
biopsies can be found in Removing samples
for cancer testing.

To understand the size of your nodule,
compare it to the tip of a new crayon. The tip of
a crayon is about 2 mm.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024

2 Lung nodules » Follow-up of solid nodules

Follow-up of solid nodules

Nodules between 6 mm and 8 mm in size will
be checked between 6 to 12 months, and if
you have a high risk for lung cancer, checked
a second time between 18 to 24 months.
Nodules that are bigger than 8 mm may be
checked with CT in 3 months or with PET/CT
now, or they may be biopsied.

Solid nodules are dense and look like thick
clouds on imaging. Follow-up care of these
nodules is partly based on your risk for lung
cancer. Your risk is low if you have minor or
no risk factors. You must not have smoked or
smoked very little.

Follow-up care for solid nodules is listed in

Guide 2.

Solid nodules less than 6 mm in size don’t
need immediate follow-up care. Your team will
decide what follow-up care is needed.

Follow-up of subsolid
nodules

Follow-up care for part-solid and nonsolid nodules found by chance is listed in

Guide 3.

Subsolid nodules are less dense than solid
nodules. They include non-solid nodules and
part-solid nodules.




Many subsolid nodules go away in time without
treatment. Those that remain are not likely to
become a problem.

Non-solid nodules look like a hazy cloud
on imaging. They are also called groundglass opacities or ground-glass nodules.

One subsolid nodule smaller than 6 mm does
not need routine follow-up care. Larger or
multiple nodules will be checked again.

Part-solid nodules have both high and low
areas of density.

remains smaller than 6 mm, repeat CT every year for 5
years. If the solid part is 6 mm or larger, you may get a
PET/CT or a biopsy.

Nodules are
smaller than
6 mm

A CT scan is recommended at 3 to 6 months after the
first scan of the nodule. If there is no increase in nodule
size or density, your doctor may want another CT at
2 and 4 years after the first scan.

Nodules are
6 mm or larger

A CT scan is recommended at 3 to 6 months after the
first scan. The next steps depend on the nodule that is
the most likely to be cancer.

2 Lung nodules » Planning to remove tissue

A single non-solid nodule larger than 6 mm
will be checked at 6 to 12 months after the first
scan. Nodules that are more likely to be cancer
will be checked at 3 to 6 months. If a follow-up
scan shows signs of cancer, you may get a
PET/CT scan or biopsy.

Your team may try to diagnose and
stage the cancer at the same time.

Planning to remove tissue

Your team will decide the best
time for cancer testing.

The plan to remove tissue to test for lung
cancer differs between people. A plan that
is best for you may not be the best plan for
another person.

Lung nodules that can’t be fully removed by
surgery are tested before cancer treatment
starts. Surgery may not be a treatment option
because of your overall health, location of a
lung nodule, or advanced cancer.

Cancer staging is a rating of the extent of
cancer in the body. The body part that likely
has cancer and is farthest from the lung nodule
will be sampled and tested.

Your team should include experts who work
often with people who have cancer. Team
members should include treating providers and
specialists, such as:


Thoracic surgeon



Thoracic radiologist



Interventional radiologist



Pulmonologist

When nodules will be surgically treated, cancer
testing may be done before or on the day of
surgical treatment.
Cancer testing can be delayed for tiny nodules
that are very likely to be early-stage lung
cancer. Cancer testing done in advance of
surgery would increase health risks, time
spent, and costs. More lung tissue may be
removed if the diagnosis is cancer.

When planning, experts think about the size
and location of tumors, your health history, and
their experience. They rely on the results of a
physical exam and imaging.

There are times when it is better to diagnose
before surgical treatment:


Your team will decide the best
method to remove test samples.



Removing tissue for cancer testing is not
always easy. Your team will decide the best
steps to remove tissue. Ways to remove test
samples are explained in the next section.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024

15

You shouldn’t wait until surgery if your
care team strongly suspects a disease
other than lung cancer.
An early diagnosis is also needed
if whole-body drug treatment called
systemic therapy will be received before
surgery or if treatment will include
stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).

2 Lung nodules » Removing samples for cancer testing » Confirming lung cancer

Removing samples for
cancer testing

The removed tissue must be large
enough for testing.
The tissue must be large enough to run
several special lab tests by the pathologist.
Pathologists are health care providers who
are experts in testing cells and tissue and
diagnosing cancer.

Your team will choose a method that removes
tissue that likely has cancer. They will consider
the risk and ease of methods and what method
you prefer.








At some cancer centers, the pathologist
checks the tissue size right after removal.
This method is called rapid on-site evaluation
(ROSE). It helps to prevent having the same
procedure a second time.

External needle biopsies involve
guiding a thin needle through your skin
and into the tumor. These procedures
include transthoracic needle aspiration
(TTNA), core needle biopsies,
pericardiocentesis, and thoracentesis.
Down-the-throat biopsies involve
guiding thin tools down your throat into
your airways (bronchus) or food pipe
(esophagus). These procedures include
standard bronchoscopy, navigational
bronchoscopy, radial endobronchial
ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy,
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided
biopsies, and robotic bronchoscopy.

Confirming lung cancer
First, the pathologist prepares the biopsy
tissue. This may take a couple of days. Then,
they examine the removed tissue with a
microscope to classify the disease. This is
called histologic typing. The remaining tissue
will be saved for possible future testing.

Keyhole surgeries involve making
small openings into your chest. Small
tools are inserted through the holes
to remove tissue. Compared to open
surgery, this method is minimally invasive,
which means healing is easier. These
surgeries include mediastinoscopy
and thoracoscopy. Thoracoscopy
can be performed by video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or robotassisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS).

Your pathologist will record the diagnostic
results in a pathology report. The report will
state if there is cancer and if the cancer started
in the lung or elsewhere. If the cancer started
in the lung, the report would also list the type
of lung cancer. Cell (histologic) types of lung
cancer include:

Open surgery involves making a large
cut through your chest wall to remove
tissue. Open surgery is seldom needed
for diagnosis. You may have open surgery
when other methods won’t work or a
larger piece of tissue is needed.

It takes a team of experts to assess lung
nodules for cancer.
Tobacco smoking is the biggest but not
the only risk factor for lung cancer.
Signs of lung cancer can be found with
imaging.
Lung nodule experts assess changes in
a nodule with a series of CT scans over
time. Nodules that quickly increase in size
or density are more likely to be cancer.
If the nodule is likely cancer, you may
have a PET/CT scan, or tissue from the
nodule may be sampled by a procedure
called a biopsy and tested for cancer.

Care team



It takes a team to plan treatment of NSCLC.
Your team will use your test results to plan
treatment. You are an important part of the
team. Tell your team about your wishes for
treatment and any challenges you are facing.
Your input is just as important as tests for
treatment planning.

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families. Be prepared to discuss the health
problems of your close blood relatives. Such
family members include siblings, parents, and
grandparents related to you by birth and not by
adoption.

Your team may consist of many members:




Thoracic surgical oncologist, medical
oncologist, and radiation oncologist to
treat the cancer

Bring a list of your medications,
herbals, and supplements to
appointments.

Palliative care provider, social worker,
mental health provider, and registered
dietitian to provide supportive services

Many of these experts are supported by
nurses, technicians, or assistants who are
often on the frontline of cancer care.

Physical exam

Health history

A team member will also perform a thorough
physical exam of your body. This exam may
include:

Expect your care team to review your health
in detail. This is known as taking a medical
history. Your team will want to know everything
possible about your past and current health.

x-rays. This doctor will convey the test results
to your care team.

Based on your health history and exam,
your care team will rate your performance
status. Performance status is your ability to
do day-to-day activities. It is one of the most
important factors that your team will use to
plan treatment.

Scans that were done more than 60 days ago
should not be used to decide your treatment.

Diagnostic CT scan

Blood tests

A CT scan is a more detailed kind of x-ray. It
takes many pictures from different angles. A
computer combines the images to make 3D
pictures.

Blood tests are commonly used to screen
for disease. They are also used to assess if
cancer is affecting organs.

A diagnostic CT shows body tissue more
clearly. It is often the first scan done to stage
lung cancer. Images of your chest and upper
abdomen including the adrenal glands are
needed.

Samples of your blood will be removed with
a needle that is inserted into a vein. This is
called a blood draw.

Complete blood count

A higher dose of radiation is used for
diagnostic CT compared to regular CT. You'll
receive an injection of contrast if it's safe
for you. Contrast is a substance that makes
images clearer. Contrast travels through your
bloodstream, and you pee it out.

A complete blood count (CBC) is needed. A
CBC measures parts of the blood including
counts of white blood cells, red blood cells,
and platelets.

Chemistry profile

FDG-PET/CT scan

A chemistry profile assesses natural salts in
your body and how well your liver and kidneys
are working.

PET/CT is necessary if you haven’t had this
scan already. It may detect cancer that was not
found by CT alone.
Your whole body will be scanned, or the scan
will extend from your neck to the middle of
your thighs.

Imaging
Imaging takes pictures of the inside of your
body. It is used to help stage the cancer by
showing cancer in lung tissue and if the cancer
has spread from the lung.

The PET scan highlights tissue in your body
that may be cancerous. Before the scan, you
will be injected with a sugar radiotracer called
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The tracer will pass
out of your body in your pee in about 2 days.

A radiologist is a doctor who’s an expert in
reading images like CT, MRI, or PET scans, or

3 Tests for NSCLC » Pulmonary function tests » Bronchoscopy

Pulmonary function tests

Cancer cells take in more of the tracer than
normal cells and show up as bright (or hot)
spots on the scan.

For some people, treatment of lung cancer is
based on how well their lungs work. Pulmonary
function tests assess how well you breathe:

Multiple health problems can cause hot spots,
so the cause of hot spots often needs to be
confirmed by other testing.



Brain MRI



Lung cancer tends to spread to the brain.
MRI may show small brain tumors that aren’t
causing symptoms. Most people with lung
cancer need a brain scan, but a brain scan
isn't needed for small stage 1 cancers.



MRI uses a safe magnetic field and radio
waves to make pictures. Contrast will also be
used unless it would not be safe for you. If you
can’t have an MRI, you may get a CT scan of
your head with contrast.

Spirometry measures how much air and
how fast you breathe.
A gas diffusion test tells how much
oxygen travels from your lungs into your
blood.
Body plethysmography measures how
much air your lungs can hold and how
much air is left in your lungs after you
breathe out.

Bronchoscopy
A bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows
providers to see inside your airways. It is done
with a medical device called a bronchoscope.
A bronchoscope has a small, flexible tube that
is gently guided down your throat and into your
airways.

MRI of spine and thoracic inlet
Superior sulcus tumors are lung cancers that
start at the top of the lung. They typically grow
into the chest wall and may grow next to your
spine, blood vessels, or nerves. In this case,
MRI of your spine and thoracic inlet is needed.
The thoracic inlet is the center of a ring of
bones at the top of the ribcage.

A bronchoscopy is needed if:



You haven’t already had a bronchoscopy
for diagnosis or cancer staging, and
The lung cancer will be treated with
surgery.

A bronchoscopy can likely be done on the
day of surgery to save time, costs, and risks.
Sometimes, a bronchoscopy is done before
surgery for a tumor in the middle of a lung.

3 Tests for NSCLC » Lymph node biopsy

Lymph node biopsy

for very small lung tumors that are on the side
of the lung opposite from the mediastinum.

Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped
structures that help the body fight disease.
There are hundreds of lymph nodes
throughout the body.

Testing is not needed for advanced cancers if
lymph nodes along the collarbone are tested.
Mediastinal lymph nodes can be reached by
one of several procedures:

When lung cancer spreads, it typically spreads
to lymph nodes in the lungs and then to lymph
nodes outside the lungs. Your care team will
use imaging results to decide which lymph
nodes to biopsy, if any.





Mediastinal lymph nodes
The space between your lungs is called the
mediastinum. This space has many lymph
nodes. Lung cancer is more likely to spread
to these nodes when the tumor is larger and
closer to this area.





For many early and locally advanced lung
cancers, the mediastinal lymph nodes need to
be tested for cancer. Testing may not be done

Lymph node biopsy
It is very important for
your care team to know
which lymph nodes have
cancer. There are a few
methods for examining
or removing lymph nodes
in the lungs and between
the lungs. Bronchoscopy
is one of those methods.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024

Mediastinoscopy is performed using a
medical device that is inserted through a
small cut in the chest.
Mediastinotomy is an open surgery of the
middle of the chest through a small cut
near the breastbone.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided
biopsy is performed using a medical
device that is guided down your body's
food tube (esophagus)
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)guided biopsy is performed using a
bronchoscope

3 Tests for NSCLC » Biomarker tests

Biomarker tests

EBUS- and EUS-guided lymph node biopsies
are often done days ahead of surgical
treatment.

Biomarker tests look for biological clues, or
markers, of cancer that differ between people.
Because of biomarkers, a treatment that helps
one person might not help you.

Other regional lymph nodes
Some advanced lung cancers have spread
to lymph nodes in the other lung or near the
collarbone. Methods to biopsy these nodes
include:






Biomarker tests are performed on tumor tissue
removed with biopsy or during surgery, but a
blood sample may be tested as well.
Biomarker tests are needed for most people
with lung cancer who will be treated with
surgery. Your care team will use biomarker
tests to decide which whole-body drug
treatments, called systemic therapy, are
options before and after surgery.

An excisional biopsy removes an entire
node through a cut into the skin.
Thoracoscopy is a surgery that makes
small openings into your chest through
which small tools are inserted to see and
remove tissue (also called video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery, or VATS).

Biomarker tests aren’t needed for very small
lung tumors because surgery alone has very
good results.

A needle biopsy involves guiding a thin
needle through your skin and into a node.

A pathologist will assess for
cancer

Biomarker tests for early and locally advanced
lung cancer may include:

Pathologists are experts in testing cells and
tissue and diagnosing cancer. They examine
tissue from lymph nodes with a microscope to
classify the disease. This is called histologic
typing.

PD-L1 level
PD-L1 is a protein on the surface of cells.
PD-L1 on cancer cells stops white blood cells
called T cells from killing them. The cancer
cells then survive and make more cancer cells.

Your pathologist will record the diagnostic
results in a pathology report. Ask your care
team for a copy of the pathology report and
to review the results with you. Take notes and
ask questions.

EGFR mutations
Lung cancer cells have a receptor on their
surface called EGFR. Cell receptors receive
and send signals like antennas.
Some mutations in the gene that makes EGFR
cause the receptor to be overactive. EGFR
overactivity makes the cancer cells quickly
grow. Among EGFR mutations, EGFR exon 19

3 Tests for NSCLC » Supportive care

deletion and EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation
are the most common.

Other specialists who may be involved in your
care include:

ALK gene rearrangement



Respiratory therapists

Some lung cancers grow quickly due to
an overactive ALK surface receptor. The
overactivity is caused when parts of two genes
switch places with each other. This is called a
gene rearrangement.



Rehabilitation specialists



Registered dietitians



Social workers

Supportive care

The library of NCCN Guidelines for Patients
has books on supportive care. These books
focus on common physical and emotional
effects of many cancers and their treatment.

Supportive care is cancer care that improves
your quality of life. It is not just for people at
the end of life who need hospice. It has been
shown to extend and enhance life for people
with lung cancer.

One of the NCCN books is about distress.
Everyone with cancer feels distressed at some
point. It is normal to feel worried, sad, helpless,
or angry. Distress can become severe and
affect the way you live.

Start supportive care early

The library of NCCN
Guidelines for Patients
is at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Supportive care is sometimes called palliative
care since symptom relief is a main goal. You
may undergo procedures that help you breathe
and eat better and reduce coughing up blood.
Supportive care addresses many needs other
than symptom relief. You can get help with
making treatment decisions and coordination
of care between health providers. You can get
emotional or spiritual support, financial aid, or
family counseling.

It’s never too late to quit smoking

A palliative care specialist may be a member
of your cancer care team. This specialist has
received specific training to provide additional
support to you. Some cancer centers have
palliative care programs.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024

If you smoke, it is important to quit. Smoking
can limit how well cancer treatment works.
Nicotine addiction is one of the hardest
addictions to stop. The stress of having cancer
may make it harder to quit.

staging is done twice
The cancer stage before treatment is
called the clinical stage. It is noted with a
lowercase c. An example is cN0.
A second staging, called the pathologic stage,
occurs after surgery. It is based on tests of
tissue removed from the body. The pathologic

example is pN1.
Some lung cancers may not be correctly
staged until after surgical treatment. For
example, all the lymph nodes with cancer
might not be found until surgery. On the other
hand, some nodes thought to have cancer may

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

Another possible option for cancer care is
clinical trials. A clinical trial is a type of medical
research study. After being developed and
tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of
fighting cancer need to be studied in people. If
found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial,
a drug, device, or treatment approach may be
approved by the FDA.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments
and clinical trials. Talk to your care team about
whether a clinical trial may make sense for
you.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your care team to bring up
clinical trials. Start the conversation and learn
about all of your treatment options. If you find
a study that you may be eligible for, ask your
treatment team if you meet the requirements.
If you have already started standard treatment,
you may not be eligible for certain clinical

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or childcare due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.

system is used to score different areas of
lung cancer growth.
There are 4 main stages of lung cancer
based on TNM scores. For some people,
cancer staging is done twice—before and
after surgery.
Surgery is a standard primary treatment
for stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 lung

Surgery is a standard treatment

Perioperative therapy

for lung cancer, but the treatment

Resectable NSCLC is sometimes treated with
more than one type of treatment. These other
treatments are referred to as perioperative
therapy. Your care team will suggest whether
you should start perioperative therapy before
or after surgery.

approach differs between people.
Read this chapter to learn what
treatment might be best for you.

Systemic therapy
Systemic therapy is commonly used for
perioperative therapy. It is a whole-body
treatment with cancer drugs.

Planning treatment
Surgery, by itself or with other treatments, is
used to treat most early non-small cell lung
cancers (NSCLCs) and many locally advanced
NSCLCs. The goal of treatment is to cure the
cancer. Ask your care team if surgery is an
option for you.

A medical oncologist is an expert in systemic
therapy and can prescribe a regimen based on
your overall health and the cancer. A regimen
consists of one or more drugs that are taken at
a specific dose, schedule, and length of time.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is sometimes used for
perioperative therapy. It may be used alone
or combined with chemotherapy. A radiation
oncologist is an expert in treating cancer with
radiation and will plan your radiation therapy.

Surgery
Surgery may be an option if all the cancer can
be safely removed. You should find and see
a highly experienced, board-certified thoracic
surgeon. Lung cancer surgery should be a
major part of their practice. To decide if you
can safely undergo surgery, your surgeon will
consider:

Types of perioperative therapy for NSCLC
Platinum-doublet
chemotherapy

Platinum-doublet chemotherapy is a systemic therapy that kills fastgrowing cells like cancer. It consists of cisplatin or carboplatin and
another type of chemotherapy. These drugs are given as a slow
injection into a vein called an infusion. Some are a pill.

Immune checkpoint
inhibitors

Atezolizumab (Tecentriq), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), and
nivolumab (Opdivo) are immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immune
checkpoint inhibitors are a type of systemic immunotherapy that
restores the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells. They are given by
infusion.

Chemoimmunotherapy

Chemoimmunotherapy is a systemic therapy consisting of both
platinum-doublet chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Targeted therapy

Osimertinib (Tagrisso) is a type of systemic therapy called targeted
therapy. It stops chemical signals from proteins called EGFR that
tell lung cancer cells to grow. It is a pill that can be taken at home.

Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy kills fast-growing cells like cancer with highenergy x-rays. A large machine aims radiation beams at the cancer
as you lie on a table. More information is in Chapter 6.

Chemoradiation

Chemoradiation is treatment with both chemotherapy and radiation
therapy. Sequential chemoradiation is the use of one treatment then
the other. Concurrent chemoradiation is the use of both treatments
during the same time frame. More information is in Chapter 7.

has spread to lymph nodes. Immunotherapy
consists of either nivolumab (Opdivo) or
pembrolizumab (Keytruda). Chemotherapy
used with immunotherapy regimens is listed in

Neoadjuvant therapy is a type of treatment
that is received before surgery. It is sometimes
called preoperative therapy or induction
therapy. For NSCLC, neoadjuvant therapy
consists of systemic therapy with or without
radiation therapy.

Guide 10.

Your medical oncologist will not prescribe
chemoimmunotherapy if it is unsafe for you. It
may not be safe if you have an autoimmune
disease or you are taking medications that
suppress your immune system.

Neoadjuvant instead of adjuvant
therapy

Your medical oncologist may not prescribe
chemoimmunotherapy if it likely won’t work
well. Immune checkpoint inhibitors don’t work
as well for lung cancer with EGFR mutations
or ALK rearrangements compared to lung
cancers without these biomarkers.

If you’ll likely need systemic therapy, you
may receive it before surgery instead of after
surgery.
Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy is
used to treat lung tumors that are at least 4
centimeters (cm) in size or lung cancer that

Superior sulcus tumors
Concurrent chemoradiation is the first
treatment of superior sulcus tumors before
surgery. Superior sulcus tumors are a distinct
subset of invasive lung cancers. They start at
the top of the lung and typically grow into the
chest wall.

When chemoimmunotherapy is not an option,
platinum-doublet chemotherapy may
be received. Platinum-doublet chemotherapy
regimens are listed in Guide 11.

Shrinking cancer before surgery
For some lung cancers, neoadjuvant therapy
is given to shrink the cancer and make surgery
easier.

Cancer stages with N2
NSCLC with an N2 stage is sometimes treated
with surgery. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy or
neoadjuvant chemoradiation may stop cancer
growth and make surgery possible.

Invasive tumors
Although not the preferred approach to
surgery, concurrent chemoradiation or
systemic therapy may be received first for:

growth that weren’t seen on imaging scans
may be found during surgery.

Surgery will be scheduled if there’s a good
chance that all the cancer will be removed.
Your surgeon must see a way to remove the
tumor with enough normal-looking tissue at its
edge, which is called the surgical margin. The
goal is to have no cancer cells in the margin,
so that a cure is the likely result of surgery.

Types of lung surgery
The type of surgery you will have depends
on where the tumor has grown and how well
your lungs work. There are five types of lung
surgery:

During surgery, your surgeon will explore
your inner chest to see where the cancer is
growing. Your surgeon will have a better view
of the tumor during surgery. Also, areas of

Wedge resection removes a small part
of a lobe.
Segmentectomy removes a large part
of a lobe.

Lung cancer surgery
There are five common lung cancer surgeries. The most common are lobectomy and
pneumonectomy and are shown below. A sleeve lobectomy removes a lobe and part of
the main airway called the bronchus. Wedge resection and segmentectomy remove only
part of a lobe.

small video camera, and the video of your
inner chest will be displayed on a screen.

Lobectomy removes an entire lobe and
is preferred for most lung cancers.
Sleeve lobectomy removes an entire
lobe and part of the main airway.

Minimally invasive surgery for lung cancer is
called thoracoscopy or video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Your
surgeon may perform thoracoscopy using
robotic arms to control the surgical tools.
This approach is called robotic-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery (RATS).

Pneumonectomy removes an entire
lung.

Lung tumors that have grown through the lung
wall into other body tissue will be removed in
one piece. This surgery is called an en-bloc
resection.

Results of surgery
Removed tissue and any sampled fluid will
be examined for cancer. Your surgeon and
pathologist will rate the surgical margin around
the tumor:

Types of lymph node surgery
During surgery, lymph nodes that have or may
have cancer will also be removed. To remove
nodes, some organs may need to be moved
or cut. There are two types of lymph node
surgery:








A systematic lymph node sampling
removes some nodes in the lung and
between the lungs.



A lymph node dissection removes
as many nodes as possible from the lung
and between the lungs.

R1 means cancer was found in the
margin with a microscope.
R2 means cancer was seen in the margin
without a microscope.

Normal-looking lymph nodes that were
removed will also be examined for cancer.
When lymph nodes farthest from the tumor
don’t have cancer, it is likely that all nodes with
cancer were removed.

Methods of surgery
Removal of a lung tumor is done with one of
two methods.

Surgery is described as a complete resection
when surgical margins, the furthest lymph
nodes, and the fluid around the lungs and
heart are cancer-free.

The classic or open method is called
thoracotomy. The surgery is performed
through a cut between the ribs. Sometimes,
part of the rib needs to be removed, too.

After surgery, you may start adjuvant therapy
or surveillance. Adjuvant therapy is discussed
in the next section in this chapter. Surveillance
is ongoing testing to check if the cancer
returned and is discussed in Chapter 8.

The newer method is a less invasive surgery
that is performed through smaller cuts between
the ribs. Your surgeon will insert surgical tools
through these cuts. One of the tools has a
NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally

R0 means no cancer was found in the
margin.

5 Surgery » Treatment after surgery

Treatment after surgery

Side effects of surgery
Common side effects of any surgery are pain,
swelling, and scars. Pain can be intense after
lung surgery. Pain and swelling often fade
away in the weeks after surgery.

Adjuvant therapy follows the main treatment.
It is also called postoperative therapy. It treats
cancer that wasn’t removed during surgery and
lowers the chance of cancer returning.

Numbness near the surgical area may be
long-lasting. There is a chance of infection,
which may cause pneumonia. There’s also
a chance of a collapsed lung, which is called
pneumothorax.

Your care team will plan treatment based on
several factors, including:

The status of the surgical margin—R0,
R1, or R2

Results of biomarker tests

Surgical margin
The tumor will be removed, along with some normal-looking tissue around its rim. The
normal-looking tissue is called the surgical margin. The surgical margin will be tested
for cancer. Adjuvant therapy is based on if there is cancer in the margins.

5 Surgery » Treatment after surgery

Cancer-free margins (R0)

Cancer in margins (R1, R2)

Even if margins are cancer-free, adjuvant
therapy is needed for some cancers. Platinumdoublet chemotherapy is used, but if it’s not an
option, osimertinib (Tagrisso) may be received
if the cancer has EGFR biomarkers. See
Guide 11 on page 39 for a list of chemotherapy
regimens.

Adjuvant therapy is needed when cancer is in
the surgical margins.
A second surgery may be done for early
cancers. It is the preferred option for stage 1
and stage 2A. After surgery, chemotherapy is
an option for stage 1B and 2A cancers but is
recommended for stage 2B cancers.

NCCN experts recommend adjuvant therapy
for larger stage 1B and stage 2A cancers
that are highly likely to return. A larger tumor
is at least 4 cm in size. Adjuvant therapy
is recommended for stage 2B and stage 3
cancers unless you had chemotherapy before
surgery.

Radiation therapy is an option for stage 1
and stage 2A cancers when surgery is likely
to cause complications. Stereotactic ablative
radiotherapy (SABR) is commonly used. After
radiation therapy, stage 2A cancers may be
treated with chemotherapy. More information
on radiation therapy is in Chapter 6.

After chemotherapy, you may receive one of
these systemic therapies:








Chemoradiation is an option for stage 2B
and stage 3 cancers if you haven’t had
it before. Either sequential or concurrent
chemoradiation is recommended after surgery
with R1 margins. Concurrent chemoradiation
is recommended when there are R2 margins.
More information on chemoradiation is in
Chapter 7.

Alectinib (Alecensa) is an option for stage
2 or stage 3 cancer with ALK biomarkers.
Osimertinib (Tagrisso) is an option for
stage 1B, stage 2, or stage 3 cancer with
EGFR biomarkers.
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) is an option for
stage 2 or stage 3 cancer with a PD-L1
level of 1 percent (1%) or higher and no
EGFR and ALK biomarkers.
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is an option
for stage 2 or stage 3 cancer with no
EGFR or ALK biomarkers.

Cancers with an N stage of N2 may be treated
with radiation therapy after chemotherapy is
completed.

Radiation therapy is a common



treatment of lung cancer. This
chapter explains how radiation



therapy works and some things to
expect during treatment.

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or
particles to treat lung cancer. The x-rays or
particles damage cancer cells, which either die
or stop making new cancer cells.
Radiation therapy is used in many ways to
treat early and locally advanced non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC):
It is used after surgery as described in
Chapter 5.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is often
delivered from a large machine.
The x-rays or particles pass
through skin and travel to
the tumor. Healthy tissue is
protected using modern types
of treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024

It is used as the main (also called
primary) treatment of stage 1 and some
stage 2 lung cancers. When the goal is to
cure cancer, it is called definitive radiation
therapy.

A radiation oncologist is a doctor who is an
expert in treating cancer with radiation. This
expert will lead a team that designs your
treatment plan and provides treatment.

Uses of radiation therapy

It is combined with chemotherapy,
called chemoradiation, as described in

Types of radiation therapy

Curing lung cancer with
radiation

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the
most common method used for lung cancer. A
large machine makes radiation beams that are
shaped to the form of the tumor. The machine
aims the highest radiation dose at the cancer.
A much lower dose is given to nearby tissue.

EBRT is used when trying to cure NSCLC.
Any of the EBRT techniques described may
be used, though NCCN experts typically prefer
SABR for early-stage cancer and IMRT for
locally advanced cancer.

There are several common techniques of
EBRT:








Overcoming treatment challenges
A lung tumor is harder to target than some
other tumors in the body. Lung tumors often
move when you breathe. To account for these
challenges, advanced methods may be used:

Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) delivers x-ray beams
that very closely match the shape of the
target and spare more normal tissue.
Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) delivers
an x-ray beam that matches the shape of
the target but may not be as focused as
IMRT.



Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy
(SABR) treats cancer with very precise,
high-dose x-ray beams. It delivers a very
high dose of radiation per treatment, but
for only a few treatments. Treatment is
finished in 1 to 1½ weeks.





Proton therapy treats cancer with
proton beams. Proton beams deliver
radiation mostly within the tumor.

Motion control methods may be used to
keep the tumor still during treatment.
At times, your radiation oncologist may
ask you to hold your breath for 15 to 20
seconds at a time to better target the
tumor.

Adjuvant therapy
Adjuvant chemotherapy may be received after
definitive radiation therapy. It is an option for
stage 2 cancer that is highly likely to return.

Radiation therapy is typically delivered daily
from Monday through Friday. Treatment visits
are about 15 minutes for IMRT and 3D-CRT
and 30 to 45 minutes for SABR and proton
therapy. Some radiation oncologists deliver
SABR treatment 2 to 3 times per week.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024

Four-dimensional computed tomography
(4D-CT) may be used for treatment
planning. It’s like a video, so your
radiation oncologist will see how the
tumor moves when you breathe.

Adjuvant chemotherapy treats cancer that
radiation did not. Large tumors and very
abnormal-looking cancer cells may have
spread to places outside the radiation field.
See Guide 11 in Chapter 5 for a list of
chemotherapy regimens used for adjuvant
therapy.

6 Radiation therapy » Side effects of radiation

Side effects of radiation

During your treatment, your radiation
oncologist will see you about once a week to
assess for possible side effects. Tell your care
team about any new or worsening symptoms
you have. There may be ways to help you feel
better. There are also ways to prevent some
side effects.

Radiation therapy does not cause pain during
a treatment session—you'll feel nothing at all—
and does not make you radioactive.
But radiation therapy may cause health
problems called side effects. Side effects of
radiation therapy are cumulative. This means
they build up slowly and are worse at the end
of treatment.

The library of NCCN Guidelines for Patients
has a book about cancer-related fatigue.
Cancer-related fatigue is a lack of energy that
is distressing, does not improve with normal
rest or sleep, and disrupts life.

Side effects that start during radiation therapy
typically improve 2 to 4 weeks after treatment
is finished.

Learn about treatment of cancer-related
fatigue at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Side effects differ by the type of radiation
therapy. Most people have no side effects
from SABR. Proton therapy may cause skin
changes but IMRT rarely does.
Adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy
often causes more side effects.








Fatigue is a common side effect of
radiation therapy.
Skin changes in the treatment area
may occur. Often, people describe skin
changes as like a sunburn. For people
with darker skin, radiation can cause the
skin to darken and be painful.
Near the end of treatment, you may have
pain when swallowing due to irritation to
your esophagus.
Although not common, your lung
may become inflamed after treatment
causing sudden shortness of breath
or cough. These are symptoms of
radiation pneumonitis. Call your radiation
oncologist immediately if you have these
symptoms.

Chemotherapy stops the process by

fast-growing cells like cancer.
Radiation therapy uses high-energy
x-rays or particles to damage cancer
cells. The cancer cells either die or can’t
make more cancer cells.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy for lung cancer
is often a liquid that is injected
into a vein. Some injections
are done in the arm or hand
while others are done though
an implanted device called a
port. An infusion is a slow drip
controlled by a pump that may
take hours.

surgery is not an option. When the goal
is to cure cancer, it is called definitive
chemoradiation.

Types of chemotherapy

Curing lung cancer

Radiation therapy is described in Chapter 6;
below is a short description of chemotherapy.

Definitive chemoradiation is a treatment option
for some stage 2B and stage 3 NSCLCs.
There are two scheduling approaches to
delivering chemoradiation:

Chemotherapy is a type of medicine. Doctors
called medical oncologists prescribe it. They
know which medicines treat which cancers.



For NSCLC, more than one type of
chemotherapy is often received. Often,
cisplatin or carboplatin is used with another
cancer drug. These regimens are called
platinum-doublet chemotherapy.



You will not receive chemotherapy every day.
Instead, it will be given in cycles of treatment
days followed by days of rest. These cycles
give your body a chance to recover after
receiving chemotherapy.

Concurrent chemoradiation means
that chemotherapy and radiation therapy
are given at the same time.
Sequential chemoradiation means
you will first complete chemotherapy
and then receive radiation therapy. This
schedule may be followed if concurrent
treatment is likely too harmful for you.

Chemotherapy regimens used for
chemoradiation are listed in Guide 12.

Chemoradiation differs between
people

You will need to go to a treatment center to
get chemotherapy. The chemotherapy will be
slowly injected into your vein. This is called an
infusion. Some chemotherapy drugs are pills.
Chemotherapy travels in your bloodstream to
treat cancer throughout your body.

Your treatment team will make a plan for you
based on several factors, such as:


Concurrent or sequential schedule



Type of lung cancer



How well a chemotherapy works
(preferred regimens work well and are
safe)

Chemotherapy cycles vary in length depending
on which drugs are used. Ask your medical
oncologist how many cycles you will have and
how many days of treatment there are within a
cycle.

Osimertinib stops the activity of EGFR and, in
turn, lowers the number of new cancer cells
being made. It is a pill that can be taken at

Chemoradiation is a treatment with both
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It
may be used to try to cure lung cancer.
Chemotherapy for lung cancer often
consists of a drug made with platinum and
one other drug. It is slowly infused into a
vein.
Often, chemotherapy and radiation
therapy are given at the same time.
Durvalumab or osimertinib may be
received after chemoradiation to improve
the chance of a cure.
Let your treatment team know about any
new or worsening symptoms.

promoting health. This chapter
reviews a few key parts of

Surveillance

survivorship care.

Survivorship care should include a schedule of
tests to check for recurrence. Routine testing
for cancer recurrence is called surveillance.
Surveillance is started when there are no signs
of cancer after treatment.

Cancer tests

Early detection of a recurrence will allow
for timely treatment. See Guide 13 for a
schedule of tests.

While non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
can sometimes be cured, it is very important
to watch for the return of the cancer. The

8 Survivorship care » Managing side effects

Managing side effects

You may be at risk for a second lung cancer.
Anyone who has been treated and cured of
one lung cancer is at risk for getting a new
lung cancer.

All cancer treatments can cause health issues
called side effects. Many effects of treatment
quickly resolve after treatment ends. An
example is nausea and vomiting. Long-term
effects start during treatment and persist after
treatment is done. Less often, effects start long
after treatment has ended. These are called
late effects.

Your risk increases as you age. If you smoke,
your chance of getting another cancer
increases the longer you smoke.

Cancer screening

During health visits, your care team will assess
for side effects. They will provide treatment
for side effects as needed. More information
on common effects is available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

A second cancer is a possible late effect of
some cancer treatments. Ask your care team
about your risk for another cancer. You may
enroll in a screening program if you have a
high risk for certain cancers.
Cancer screening is routine testing for cancer
before cancer symptoms start.
Not every type of cancer has a screening
program. There are cancer screening
programs for:

Disease prevention

Key points

Another part of survivorship care is to prevent
diseases. Such care can include getting
immunization shots for the flu, herpes,
shingles, and other diseases. Dental cleaning
and exams on a regular basis can prevent
disease, too. Ask your care team what health
care you need.





It’s important to start or keep a healthy lifestyle.
Healthy living may improve your health and
well-being. It may also help prevent the cancer
from returning. Work with your care team to set
goals and make plans for healthy living.



Common goals for healthy living include:













Seeing a primary care provider on a
regular basis


Being physically active and avoiding
inactivity
Eating healthful foods and limiting
drinking alcohol
Achieving and maintaining a healthy body
weight
Not using tobacco
Avoiding infections and getting safe
vaccines

and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for
Cancer app.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024

59

Your care team will monitor for a return
of lung cancer. Early detection allows for
timely treatment. You will also be checked
for other cancers, including a second lung
cancer.
If you have a high risk for certain cancers,
you may enroll in a screening program.
Some side effects of treatment are longterm or may appear years later. At followup visits, your team will assess for side
effects. Tell your team about any new or
worsening symptoms. There may be ways
to prevent or treat side effects.
Preventing diseases is a part of followup care. Such care can include getting
immunization shots and dental cleaning.
Healthy living may improve your health
and prevent disease.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:




What you want and how that might differ
from what others want

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Your religious and spiritual beliefs

Support groups



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.
