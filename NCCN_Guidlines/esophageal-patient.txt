About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers,
Version 2.2024 – April 23, 2024

food passes from the throat to

Food and drink enter the mouth and move
through the esophagus into the stomach.
When you swallow, small contractions, called
peristalsis, along with gravity and pressure,
move food down the esophagus and into the
stomach. Except during the act of swallowing,
the esophagus is normally empty.

the stomach. Esophageal cancer
starts when abnormal cells grow
out of control in the layers of the
esophagus inner lining.

The esophagus is about 10 inches long and
about 1 inch wide. It has two sphincters,
circular muscles that normally remain
closed except during the act of swallowing.
One sphincter is located at the top of the
esophagus and the other at the bottom,
between the esophagus and the stomach.

The esophagus
The esophagus is located behind the trachea
(windpipe) and in front of the spine. It is part
of the digestive system. The digestive system
transports and breaks down food, absorbs
nutrients, and removes waste from the body.
It includes the esophagus, stomach, liver,

The digestive tract
The digestive or gastrointestinal (GI)
tract is part of the digestive system.
Food enters the mouth and passes
through the esophagus into the
stomach. After being broken down into
a liquid, food enters the small intestine.
The large intestine prepares unused
food to be moved out of the body.

Parts of the esophagus

Middle esophagus

Esophagus wall

The middle part of the esophagus is a mixture
of striated and smooth muscle.

The esophagus wall contains 4 layers:

Lower esophagus

1. Mucosa – inner membrane that is in
contact with food. It has 3 parts:






The lower part of the esophagus consists only
of smooth muscle. Smooth muscle is not under
your control. It is involuntary, like a reflex.

Epithelium – innermost lining and is
normally made up of flat, thin cells called
squamous cells

Esophagogastric junction

Lamina propria – thin layer of connective
tissue under the epithelium

The esophagogastric junction (EGJ) is the
place where the stomach and the esophagus
meet, found just beneath the diaphragm. It
is also called the gastroesophageal junction
(GEJ). It separates the contents of the
esophagus from the contents of the stomach
(acid).

Muscularis mucosa - very thin layer of
muscle under the lamina propria

2. Submucosa – layer of connective tissue
just below the mucosa that contains blood
vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels.
In some parts of the esophagus, this layer
also includes glands that secrete mucus.

Esophageal cancer

3. Muscularis propria – thick layer of muscle
under the submucosa. It contracts in a
coordinated way to push food down the
esophagus from the throat to the stomach
(peristalsis).

Cancer of the esophagus (or esophageal
cancer) starts when cells in the epithelium of
the esophagus begin to grow out of control.
There are 2 types of esophageal cancer:

4. Tunica adventitia – outermost layer, made
of connective tissue



Upper esophagus
The upper part of the esophagus is made of
striated muscle. Striated muscle generates
force and contracts. It is under your control
(voluntary).

Esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (ESCC) starts in the thin,
flat cells found in the inner lining of the
esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) is often found in the upper and
middle esophagus but can occur in the
lower esophagus as well.
Esophageal adenocarcinoma
(EAC) starts in the mucus-making cells
of the inner lining of the esophagus.
Adenocarcinomas are often found in the

lower esophagus but can occur in the
middle esophagus as well.

Through your cancer care, you
might find measurements using
the metric system (centimeters,
millimeters, etc.). That is
because your care team uses
the metric system to measure
many aspects of treatment.

Today, most esophageal cancers in
North America and Western Europe are
adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma
is more common in Eastern Europe, Asia, and
Africa. Treatment is based on the type and
location of esophageal cancer, in addition to
the stage of the tumor (where it is in the body).
Some tumors that start in the stomach
and cross over into the area between the
esophagus and stomach (esophagogastric
junction) are treated as esophageal cancers
and not as stomach cancers. However, this
depends on the exact location of the tumor.
Siewert types used as part of cancer staging
describe where the tumor is relative to the
esophagus and stomach.

Esophageal cancers tend to develop slowly
over many years. Before cancer develops,
pre­cancerous changes often occur in the inner
lining (mucosa) of the esophagus. Since these
early changes rarely cause symptoms, they
often go undetected.
Stages of esophageal cancer can be grouped
into 3 main categories, depending on how far
the cancer has spread.

Barrett esophagus
In Barrett esophagus (BE), the squamous
cells that line the lower part of the esophagus
have changed or been replaced with abnormal
cells as a result of chronic reflux. Those with
Barrett esophagus are at risk of developing
adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.





How cancer spreads
Esophageal cancer usually starts in the
innermost layer (mucosa) and grows outward
through and along the layers of the esophagus
wall. Cancer can spread to nearby lymph
nodes, veins, arteries, and organs such as the
liver, pancreas, lung, and spleen. It might also
grow into nearby lymphatic or blood vessels,
and from there spread to nearby lymph nodes
or to other parts of the body.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

Early-stage cancer has not grown
beyond the inside of the esophagus. The
tumor may be very small (2 centimeters or
less, which is about the size of a peanut)
and is not in any lymph nodes.
Locoregional or locally advanced
cancer has invaded the esophagus wall
and/or spread to the lymph nodes or
organs near or in direct contact with the
esophagus.
Metastatic cancer has spread to other
parts of the body. The most common
metastatic sites are the liver, distant
lymph nodes, lung, bone, and brain.

Cancer can spread to distant parts of
the body through the blood or lymphatic
system. This is called metastatic
esophageal cancer. Distant metastases
could be in the liver, distant lymph nodes,
and lung.

It's beneficial to have a support system
in place during diagnosis and treatment.
Enlist the help of friends, family members,
or peers who can provide transportation,
meals, and emotional support. These can
be different people for different tasks or
change over time.

In your contact list, include information on
your exact type of cancer, as well as any
treatments and the date each treatment
started.
Set up an online patient portal (MyChart
or health record account) if it’s
available, which can help you track your
appointments and communicate with
your care team. Remember, many times,
the portal messages are not immediately
seen by a nurse or physician. Be sure
to ask your care team how best to
communicate with them, especially in an
emergency.

More information on these tests is on the
following pages. For possible tests, see

Guide 1.

Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.
Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.
Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and

Medical history



A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Tell your doctor about any symptoms you
have. A medical (or health) history will help
determine which treatment is best for you.



Check your weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat



Family history


Some cancers and other diseases can run in
families. Your doctor will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. You can ask family members about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed.

Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate

Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched
Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin

2 Diagnosing esophageal cancer » Nutritional assessment » Blood tests

Nutritional assessment

Blood tests

You may need to meet with a nutrition expert
before starting treatment. The nutritionist or
dietician can assess the impact of the cancer
on your health. Esophageal cancer can make
you lose your appetite or cause difficulty or
pain when swallowing foods or liquids. You
may also feel full after eating very little. These
changes may have caused you to lose too
much weight or make you feel weak and tired.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and
platelets in your blood. Your doctor will want
to know if you have enough red blood cells
to carry oxygen throughout your body, white
blood cells to fight infection, and platelets to
control bleeding.

It is important that you receive adequate and
sustained nutrition before you start treatment.
You might receive food through a plastic
tube that is placed through the skin of your
abdomen into your stomach or small intestine.

Comprehensive chemistry profile

During and after treatment, your care team will
monitor for weight loss and other signs you
aren’t getting enough nutrition.

A comprehensive chemistry profile provides
important information about how well your
kidneys and liver are working, among other
things. It is usually part of a comprehensive
metabolic panel (CMP). A CMP measures 14
different substances in your blood.

Nutrition matters
Esophageal cancer can make
eating more challenging. A
dietician or nutritionist can
help you with any nutrition
needs before, during, and after
cancer treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

2 Diagnosing esophageal cancer » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

PET scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer that is
not harmful. A tracer is a substance injected
into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the
body and if they are using sugar produced by
your body to grow. Cancer cells show up as
bright spots on PET scans. However, not all
tumors will appear on a PET scan. Also, not
all bright spots are cancer. It is normal for the
brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright
on a PET scan. Inflammation or infection can
also show up as a bright spot. When a PET
scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT
scan. It may be done with one or two machines
depending on the cancer center. An FDG-PET/
CT scan uses 18-fluorodeoxyglucose as its
tracer.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Images can be made with scanning
machines or scoping tools. Imaging tests may
show if the tumor involves any veins, arteries,
and other organs. A radiologist, an expert in
interpreting imaging tests, will write a report
and send this report to your doctor. Your doctor
will discuss the results with you.

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture.

Ultrasound

A CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and/
or pelvis may be one of the tests to look for
cancer. Oral (by mouth) and IV (by a needle
placed into a vein in your arm) contrast
are often used together when testing for
esophageal cancer.

An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer) will
be held and pressed onto your abdomen using
gel. Ultrasound does not use x-rays. It can
show small areas of cancer that are near the
skin. Sometimes, an ultrasound or CT is used
to guide a biopsy.

Contrast materials are not dyes, but
substances that help to make the pictures
clearer. The contrast is not permanent and will
leave the body in your urine immediately after
the test. Tell your care team if you have had
allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This
is important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

2 Diagnosing esophageal cancer » Endoscopy procedures

Endoscopy procedures

Endoscopic ultrasound
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) uses both
imaging and an endoscope to see how deep
the tumor has grown into the esophagus wall.
Signs of cancer within lymph nodes and other
nearby organs can also be detected. An EUS
is an important part of cancer diagnosis and
staging.

Some imaging tests use a thin, tube-shaped
tool called a scope that is inserted into the
body to take pictures. One end of the scope
has a small light and camera lens to see inside
your body. The image is sent to a television
monitor. This will help guide your doctor in a
biopsy, stent placement, or other tasks. The
scope is guided into the body through a natural
opening, such as the mouth, nose, or anus. It
may also be inserted through a small surgical
cut.

Upper GI endoscopy or EGD
In an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy
or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD),
a device is guided down the throat into the
esophagus, stomach, and upper parts of
the small intestine (duodenum). An EGD is
used to inspect the lining of these organs
and to look for any signs of cancer or other
abnormalities such as dilated blood vessels or
ulcers. Biopsies are usually performed during
an EGD. A dilating (stretching) procedure
can also be done if a tumor is obstructing

More than one type of scope may be used for
imaging tests. The type of scope often used
for esophageal cancer is called an endoscope.
An endoscope is often guided into the body
through the mouth. Endoscopy is an important
tool in the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and
care of those with esophageal cancer. Before
an endoscopy, you will be given medicine to
help you relax or sleep during the procedure.

Upper endoscopy
Upper endoscopy allows your
doctor to see the inner wall of
your stomach and esophagus. If
ultrasound is used, your doctor
will be able to see the deeper wall
layers and nearby organs.

the esophagus. After the endoscopy, your
throat may feel sore, and you may feel some
swelling.

A biopsy removes a sample of tissue or fluid
during an upper endoscopy. Several samples
may be taken from the tumor, wall of your
esophagus or stomach, and lymph nodes. The
samples will be sent to a pathologist, an expert
in examining cells under a microscope to find
disease.

Bronchoscopy
During a bronchoscopy, a device is inserted
through the nose or mouth to examine the
inside of your airway, including the trachea and
bronchi. Bronchoscopy may be used to detect
cancer from the esophagus or to perform some
treatment procedures.

Other types of biopsies may include:


Laparoscopy
Laparoscopy (key-hole surgery or minimally
invasive surgery) is a surgical procedure that
inserts a camera and various instruments
(laparoscope) through small cuts (ports)
in the abdomen. During the procedure, a
tool can take tissue samples or remove
tumors. Laparoscopy is done under general
anesthesia. This is a loss of feeling and a
complete loss of awareness that feels like a
very deep sleep.





Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or
core biopsy (CB) uses needles of
different sizes to remove a sample of
tissue or fluid. An endoscopic ultrasound
(EUS) may guide the FNA for diagnosis.
Brushings or washings involve
removing tumor or cell samples with a
small brush at the end of an endoscope.
Liquid biopsy uses a sample of blood
for testing.

Biopsy of metastases
A metastasis is the spread of cancer to an
area of the body such as the lung, liver, kidney,
bone, or distant lymph nodes. A biopsy of the
metastasis may be needed to confirm the
presence of cancer. If there is more than one
metastasis, each site may be biopsied. The
type of biopsy used depends on the location of
the suspected metastases and other factors.

2 Diagnosing esophageal cancer » Biomarker testing

“

Biomarker testing
A sample from a biopsy of your tumor
may be tested to look for specific DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations (abnormal
changes), protein levels, or other molecular
features. It is sometimes called molecular
testing or tumor profiling. Biomarker testing
includes tests of genes or their products
(proteins). It identifies the presence or absence
of mutations and certain proteins that might
guide prognosis or treatment. Proteins are
written like this: NTRK. Genes are written in
italics like this: NTRK. Your care team will
recommend the best types of biomarker testing
for you.

From the moment you get a cancer
diagnosis, you are thrust into a
world of new terms, many of them
vital to understanding what is
happening to you. It’s important to
understand what biomarkers are
and even how these biomarkers
can affect treatments.”

genetic testing for mutations you may have
inherited from your biological parents. In tumor
mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and
not the rest of your body. Many mutations such
as NTRK gene fusions can be targeted with
specific therapies.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), or next-generation sequencing
(NGS) are types of tests used to look for
biomarkers.

HER2

Testing for HER2 status, microsatellite
instability (MSI) status, programmed death
ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumor mutational
burden, neurotrophic tropomyosin­related
kinase (NTRK), and rearranged during
transfection (RET) gene fusions as well as
BRAF V600E (gene that encodes a protein
B-raf) mutation are important for the treatment
and management of advanced esophageal
cancer.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. It is found on the surface of all cells.
When amounts are high, it causes cells to
grow and divide. This is called HER2 positive
(HER2+), overexpression, or amplification.
There might be higher amounts of HER2 in
your esophageal cancer. A sample of your
tumor might be tested for HER2. If your
tumor makes too much HER2, you might
receive a targeted therapy called trastuzumab
(Herceptin) or a biosimilar, or trastuzumab
deruxtecan (Enhertu). A biosimilar is an almost
identical version of trastuzumab made by
another company. It is used in the exact same
way and at the same dose as trastuzumab.

Tumor mutation testing
Tumor mutation testing or tumor genomic
aberration testing uses a sample of your tumor
or blood to see if the cancer cells have any
specific DNA mutations. This information may
be used to guide certain drug choices. This
is a different type of DNA testing than the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

17

2 Diagnosing esophageal cancer » Biomarker testing

MSI-H/dMMR
Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of
DNA that are fixed by mismatch repair (MMR)
proteins. Some cancers prevent these errors
from being fixed. This is called microsatellite
instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair
(dMMR). When cancer cells have more than
a normal number of microsatellites, it is called
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). This is
often due to dMMR genes.

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit
A history of smoking or vaping nicotine
increases your chances of developing
lung and other cancers. Smoking
and vaping can limit how well cancer
treatment works and prevents wound
healing. It also greatly increases your
chances of having side effects during and
after surgery. Cannabis use might also
affect the amount of anesthesia used
during surgery.

Tumor mutational burden
When there are 10 or more mutations per
million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H). TMB-H
can be used to help predict response to cancer
treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors
that target the proteins called programmed
death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that
makes you want to keep smoking and
vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging
for most people who smoke or vape. The
stress of having cancer may make it even
harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask
your care team about counseling and
medicines to help you quit.

PD-L1
Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an
immune protein. If this protein is expressed
on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause
your immune cells to ignore the cancer and
suppress the anti-tumor immune response.
If your cancer expresses the PD-L1 protein,
you might have treatment that combines
chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor
therapy. This is designed to activate your
immune system to better fight off the cancer
cells.

NTRK gene fusions

Next-generation sequencing

In a tumor with an NTRK gene fusion, a piece
of the NTRK gene and a piece of another
gene fuse or join. This activates the NTRK
gene in a way that causes uncontrolled cell
growth. Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) and entrectinib
(Rozlytrek) might be used to target tumors with
a NTRK gene fusion.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a highthroughput method used to determine a portion
of a person’s DNA sequence. This method
would only be used if enough tumor tissue
remains after other biomarker testing has been
completed.

PCR

RET gene fusions

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions of
copies of your DNA (genetic information). PCR
is very sensitive. It can find 1 abnormal cell
among more than 100,000 normal cells. These
copies called PCR product might be used for
NGS.

Rearranged during transfection (RET) gene
mutation is related to cell growth (proliferation).
Selpercatinib (Retevmo) might be used for
esophageal cancer with a RET gene fusion.

BRAF V600E
Mutations in the BRAF gene can cause
normal cells to become cancerous. Dabrafenib
(Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist) might be
used for tumors with BRAF V600E mutations.

Liquid biopsy
Some mutations can be found by testing
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. In
a liquid biopsy, a sample of blood is taken to
look for cancer cells or for pieces of DNA from
tumor cells. This is similar to NGS but uses a
blood sample rather than a tissue sample.

FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a
lab testing method that involves special dyes
called probes that attach to pieces of DNA, the
genetic material in a person’s cells. This can
tell how many copies of a gene are present in
the cell.

Those who have metastatic or advanced
esophageal cancer and are unable to undergo
a traditional biopsy might have a liquid biopsy.
Sometimes testing can quickly use up a tumor
sample and a liquid biopsy might be an option
in this case. The number of genes assessed
by liquid biopsy is less than in tisssue-based
NGS.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a staining
process that involves using a chemical marker
to detect cell proteins such as HER2 and
PD-L1. The cells are then studied using a
microscope.

2 Diagnosing esophageal cancer » Genetic risk testing » Performance status

Genetic risk testing

Performance status

Genetic risk testing is done using blood or
saliva (spitting into a cup). The goal is to look
for gene mutations inherited from your genetic
parents called germline mutations. Some
mutations can put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. You can pass these genes
on to your children. Also, family members
might carry these mutations. Tell your doctor if
there is a family history of cancer. Depending
on your family history or other features of your
cancer, your health care provider might refer
you for hereditary genetic testing to learn more
about your cancer. A genetic counselor will
speak to you about the results.

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be rated
using a PS scale called Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) or the Karnofsky
Performance Status (KPS). PS is one factor
taken into consideration when choosing a
treatment plan. In general, a lower PS means
that it will be harder for you to tolerate cancer
drugs. Your preferences about treatment are
always important.

ECOG PS
The ECOG PS scores range from 0 to 5.

Hereditary syndromes



Certain genetic (inherited) syndromes may put
someone at risk for developing esophageal
cancer. A syndrome is a group of signs or
symptoms that occur together and suggest the
presence of or risk for a disease.





A genetic risk assessment will identify if you
carry a cancer risk and if you may benefit
from genetic testing, additional screening, or
preventive interventions. Depending on the
genetic risk assessment, you might undergo
genetic testing and genetic counseling.





Hereditary syndromes most closely related to
esophageal and EGJ cancers include:




Familial Barrett esophagus (FBE)



Bloom syndrome (BS)



Fanconi anemia (FA)

PS 1 means the person is still able to
perform light to moderate activity, but with
some limitations.
PS 2 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed less than half of the day and
still able to care for self.
PS 3 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed more than half of the day.
PS 4 means the person is totally confined
to the bed or chair and completely unable
to care for self.
PS 5 means the person is not alive.

In esophageal cancer, PS might be referred to
as good or poor. Good PS is usually PS 0 or

Siewert Type I – The tumor center is
located within 1 to 5 cm above the EGJ

EGJ, which infiltrates the EGJ and the
lower esophagus from below.

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.

Siewert Type III tumors are considered and
treated as stomach (gastric) cancers. For
more information, see NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Stomach Cancer, available at NCCN.
org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins. Doctors may
explain your cancer stage in different ways
than described next.

TNM scores
The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system
is used to stage esophageal cancer. In this
system, the letters T, N, and M describe
different areas of cancer growth. Based on
imaging and pathology results, a score or
number is assigned to each letter. The higher
the number, the larger the tumor or the more
the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or
other organs. These scores will be combined
to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM example
might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M0.

Staging
Esophageal cancer staging is often done
twice: before any treatment and after surgery.




Clinical stage (c) is the rating given
before any treatment. It is based on a
physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests.
An example might look like cN2 or cM1.

The TNM letters represent the following:


Pathologic stage (p) or surgical
stage is determined by examining tissue
removed during surgery. An example
might be pN2. If you are given drug
therapy before surgery (neoadjuvant),
then the stage might use a y before it and
look like ypT3.





A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. AJCC is just one type of staging system.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

T (tumor) – Depth and spread of the
main (primary) tumor in the wall of
esophagus
N (node) – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes
M (metastasis) – If cancer has
spread to distant parts of the body or
metastasized

A specific diagnosis of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma is
needed for staging and treatment purposes.
Mixed adenosquamous carcinomas and
carcinomas are staged using the TNM system
for SCC.

3 Staging » Staging

Grade

Numbered stages

Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells
look under a microscope (called histology).
Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread
faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means
the grade can’t be determined, followed by G1,
G2, and G3. Well differentiated (G1) means
the cancer cells look similar to normal cells.

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores.
Stages range from stage 1 to stage 4, with
4 being the most advanced. They might be
written as stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage
IV.
Other terms might be used instead of
numbered cancer stages. This book will use
the following terms to describe esophageal
cancer:

Poorly differentiated (G3) means the cancer
cells look very different compared to normal
cells. G3 is the highest grade for esophageal
cancers.


GX – Grade cannot be determined



G1 – Well differentiated



G2 – Moderately differentiated







G3 – Poorly differentiated or
undifferentiated



Resectable – Tumor can be removed
completely with surgery.
Unresectable – Tumor cannot be
removed with surgery. It might involve
nearby veins and arteries making it
unsafe to remove.
Locoregional or locally advanced –

be in nearby lymph nodes, organs, and
tissues.


Metastatic – Cancer has spread
to other parts of the body, including
distant lymph nodes. The most common
metastatic sites are the liver, distant
lymph nodes, lung, bone, and brain.

•

Tis and T1 tumors are often considered earlystage cancer. Esophageal cancers are rarely
found this early.

T = Tumor
A tumor can grow through the layers of the
esophagus wall and into nearby structures.







There are hundreds of lymph nodes
throughout your body. They work as filters to
help fight infection and remove harmful things
from your body. Regional lymph nodes are
found near the esophagus. Cancer found in a
lymph node is called a lymph node metastasis.
This is different than a distant metastasis,
which is found farther from the main tumor in
the esophagus.

T1 – Tumor invades the lamina propria,
muscularis mucosa, or submucosa.

•


N = Regional lymph node

Tis – High-grade dysplasia (HGD) is
cancer that has not grown beyond the
epithelium.

•

T1a – Tumor invades the lamina propria
or muscularis mucosa.

Lymph, a clear fluid containing cells that
help fight infections and other diseases,
drains through channels from the wall of
the esophagus into lymphatic vessels in the
mucosa and submucosa. From here, lymph
drains into lymph nodes outside and along the
esophagus. These lymph nodes drain into the
thoracic duct. It is possible for cancer cells to
travel through lymph to other parts of the body.

T1b – Tumor invades the submucosa.

T2 – Tumor invades the muscle layer
called muscularis propria.
T3 – Tumor invades the adventitia.
T4 – Tumor has grown all the way
through the wall of the esophagus into
nearby structures.
•

Since the lymphatic network is concentrated in
the submucosa, lymph node metastases can
be found in early-stage cancers.

T4a – Tumor has grown into nearby
structures, such as the pleura,
pericardium, azygos vein, diaphragm,
or peritoneum. The pleura covers the
lungs and lines the interior wall of the
chest cavity. The pericardium is the sac
that surrounds the heart. The azygos
vein is a blood vessel that carries blood
from the back walls of the chest and
abdomen to the heart. The peritoneum

metastatic sites are the liver, distant lymph
nodes, and lung.

Lymph nodes must be removed to confirm
cancer. The removal of many lymph
nodes is called lymph node dissection
(lymphadenectomy). It might be referred to as
a nodal dissection. At least 15 lymph nodes
should be removed in curative surgery when
the esophageal tumor is also removed.


The clinical (before surgery) stage is based on
the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and other
imaging or biopsy results. These tests are
done before any treatment as part of an initial
diagnosis.

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Endoscopic therapy

Endoscopic therapy
Endoscopic resection is a
minimally invasive procedure
that uses an endoscope
to remove precancerous
and cancerous areas of the
esophagus.

Some treatments use a thin, tube-shaped tool
called an endoscope that is inserted into the
body to take pictures. One end of the scope
has a small light and camera lens to see
inside your body. The image is displayed on
a television monitor. This will help guide your
doctor for a biopsy, treatment, or other tasks.
An endoscope is often guided into the body
through the mouth.
The goal of endoscopic therapy is to remove
or destroy early-stage disease and Barrett
esophagus (BE). Endoscopic resection (ER)
with or without ablation is preferred for earlystage cancer.

through suction or by cutting it away. Talk to
your doctor to learn more.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection

Endoscopic resection

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)
uses an endoscope to locate the tumor in the
esophagus wall. A tool is inserted through
the endoscope that injects fluid between the
tumor and layer of the esophageal wall. Then
a tool lifts and cuts away the tumor from the
esophageal wall.

For those with early-stage (T1a or T1b)
esophageal cancer or BE, endoscopic mucosal
resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal
dissection (ESD) is essential for accurate
staging and diagnosis.
Early-stage esophageal cancer has not
grown beyond the first layer (mucosa) of the
esophagus wall. The tumor is often very small
(2 centimeters or less) and is not in any lymph
nodes.

Ablation
Ablation uses extreme cold or extreme heat,
radio waves, microwaves, or chemicals to
destroy cancer cells. It can destroy small
tumors and metastases with little harm to
nearby tissue. You might have multiple
treatments to destroy the tumor or metastasis.
Ablation might be used if you are not healthy
enough for surgery.

Endoscopic mucosal resection
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a
procedure to remove pre-cancerous, earlystage cancer or other abnormal tissues
(lesions) from the esophagus wall. During
EMR, the endoscope is passed down your
throat to reach the lesion or tumor in your
esophagus. The lesion can be removed

There are many types of ablation used to
destroy cancer cells. Those most commonly
used to treat an esophageal tumor include:






Surgery and endoscopic
procedures are best performed
by experienced surgeons and
endoscopists in high-volume
centers for esophageal cancer.
High volume means performing
dozens of procedures per year.

Cryotherapy or cryosurgery kills
cancer cells by freezing them with a very
cold substance.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) kills
cancer cells by heating them with highenergy radio waves.
Photodynamic therapy (PTD) uses
drugs that become active when exposed
to light. These activated drugs may kill
cancer cells.

Surgery

The removal of the cancer through surgery can
be accomplished in different ways depending
on the specific circumstances, such as the
size and location of the tumor, and if there is
cancer in any surrounding organs and tissues.
Surgery is based on the safest and best way to
remove the cancer.

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. Often, surgery
is the main or primary treatment to remove
the cancer from the esophagus. This is only
one part of a treatment plan. Surgery can also
provide supportive care by easing pain or
discomfort. This is called palliative surgery.

Open surgery
Open surgery may include incisions in the
chest (thoracotomy), abdomen (laparotomy),
or neck. These larger incisions let your doctor
directly view and access the tumor in your
esophagus to remove it. Open surgery may
take several hours or longer. After the surgery,
you will need to stay in the hospital for several
days or longer to recover.

When preparing for surgery, seek the opinion
of an experienced surgeon. The surgeon
should be an expert in performing your type of
surgery. Surgery for esophageal cancer should
be done at a high-volume center that does at
least 15 to 20 esophageal surgeries each year
(as well as having on staff multidisciplinary
teams and dedicated thoracic surgical,
medical, and radiation oncologists). Hospitals
that perform many surgeries often have better
results. You can ask for a referral to a hospital
or cancer center that has experience in
treating your type of cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

Minimally invasive surgery
Minimally invasive surgery (key-hole surgery)
uses several small incisions. Small tools are
inserted through each incision to perform the
surgery. One of the tools, called a videoscope,

36

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Surgery

Surgical margins

is a long tube with a video camera at the
end. The camera lets your doctor see your
esophagus and other tissues inside your chest
and abdomen. Other tools are used to remove
the tumor. Minimally invasive surgery, also
called thoracoscopic and laparoscopic surgery,
can also be done using robotic arms to control
the surgical tools. This is called robot-assisted
or robotic surgery.

The goal of surgery is a cancer-free surgical
margin with reasonable functional outcome.
This is your ability to perform daily tasks of
living. After surgery, you may receive treatment
such as radiation, chemoradiation, or systemic
therapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.


Tumor resection
Imaging tests will be ordered to see if your
cancer is resectable (can be removed
completely by surgery) or unresectable
(cannot be removed completely by surgery).
Sometimes, imaging and scoping tests cannot
clearly show one way or the other.





Goal of surgery
The goal of surgery (tumor resection) is to
remove all of the cancer. To do so, the tumor
is removed along with some normal-looking
tissue around its edge called the surgical
margin. The surgical margin may look normal,
but cancerous cells may be found when
viewed under a microscope by a pathologist.
A clear or negative margin (R0) is when no
cancer cells are found in the tissue around the
edge of the tumor. In a positive margin, cancer
cells are found in normal-looking tissue around
the tumor.

In a clear or negative margin (R0),
no cancerous cells are found in the tissue
around the edge of the tumor.
In an R1 positive margin, the surgeon
removes all the visible tumor, but the
microscopic edges are still positive for
tumor cells. Despite best efforts, this can
happen.
In an R2 positive margin, the surgeon
is unable to remove all the visible tumor
or there is metastatic disease (M1).

A negative margin (R0) is the best result.
Your surgeon will look carefully for cancer not
only along the surgical margin, but in other
nearby areas. An intraoperative pathology
consultation is often used by surgeons. This
includes inspecting the resected esophageal
tissue for cancer location and distance to
margins, examining by microscope frozen
sections of the margins, and examining by
microscope for possible metastasis such as in
the liver or abdomen. Intraoperative pathology
consultation serves an important role in
guiding the surgery.

You may receive treatment before surgery
called neoadjuvant, induction, or preoperative
therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy will help reduce
the size of the tumor and the amount of cancer
in the body.

Despite best efforts, it is not always possible
to find all of the cancer. Sometimes, surgeons
can’t safely remove the tumor with a cancerfree margin.
You might have more than one surgery. You
might also have a wound drain to prevent fluid

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

37

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Esophagectomy

from collecting in the body after surgery. These
drains are usually removed a few days after
surgery.

Types of esophagectomy include:


Esophagectomy
An esophagectomy removes part, most, or
all of the esophagus. An esophagectomy is a
big operation, even when it uses a minimally
invasive approach. The surgery crosses two
or three body cavities—abdomen, chest, and
neck—and usually takes 4 to 6 hours. Eating
a healthy diet and exercising before surgery is
important. When you are in your best possible
physical condition before surgery, it is more
likely that you will experience a quicker and
easier recovery after surgery.



A transthoracic esophagectomy
(TTE) is performed through creating an
opening on the abdomen and the chest,
and occasionally in the neck as well. The
stomach may be joined to the esophagus
in the chest or in the neck, depending on
the location of the tumor.

Minimally invasive laparoscopic and
thoracoscopic or robotic surgical approaches
may be incorporated in esophagectomy.

Before and after an
esophagectomy
These images show before
and after an esophagectomy.
In this case, a large portion
of the esophagus has been
removed. The stomach has
been pulled up and joined with
the esophagus. Sometimes,
instead of the stomach, a piece
of the small intestine or colon is
used to replace the missing part
of the esophagus.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

A transhiatal esophagectomy
(THE) is performed through creating
an opening on the neck and abdomen.
Typically, the stomach is joined to the
esophagus in the neck.

38

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Other procedures » Systemic therapy

Reconstruction conduits

fluid to leave the stomach and can be used
to give medicines and fluids, including liquid
food. Giving food through a gastrostomy tube
is a type of enteral nutrition. It is also called a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)
tube.

A conduit is a tube-shaped tissue, such as
the stomach, the colon, or small intestine,
used to replace or reconstruct the part
of the esophagus removed during an
esophagectomy. A stomach (gastric) conduit
is preferred and is the most commonly used
conduit for esophageal reconstruction.
The stomach is a large, durable organ with
abundant blood supply.

J-tube
A jejunostomy tube (J-tube) is a soft, plastic
tube placed through the skin of the abdomen
into the midsection of the small intestine. The
tube delivers food and medicine until you are
healthy enough to eat by mouth.

The type of esophageal resection is dictated
by the location of the tumor, the available
choices for conduit, and the surgeon’s
experience and preference, as well as your
preference.

Systemic therapy

Other procedures

Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might
be used alone or with other therapies. Goals
and side effects of systemic therapy should be
discussed with your care team before starting
treatment. Having a better idea of what to
expect can help inform your wishes about
treatment.

Esophagogastrectomy
In an esophagogastrectomy, the top part of the
stomach and distal part of the esophagus are
removed. A nutritionist or dietician provides
guidance on what foods are most suitable for
you before and after this surgery.



Lymph node dissection
The removal of lymph nodes or groups of
lymph nodes is called lymph node or nodal
dissection. It might be referred to as a
lymphadenectomy. At least 15 regional nodes
should be removed and tested for cancer.

Neoadjuvant or preoperative
therapy is systemic therapy or
chemoradiation given before surgery.
Perioperative therapy is systemic
therapy given before and after surgery.
Adjuvant or postoperative therapy
is systemic therapy or radiation therapy
given after surgery.
Palliative therapy is systemic therapy
given for advanced disease.

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Systemic therapy

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. When chemotherapies
are combined, it is called multi-agent or
combination chemotherapy. Chemotherapy
might be used before and after surgery.
It might be used with radiation (called
chemoradiation).

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

Some examples of chemotherapies include:


Capecitabine (Xeloda)



Carboplatin



Cisplatin



Docetaxel (Taxotere)



Fluorouracil



Irinotecan (Camptosar)



Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin)



Paclitaxel (Taxol)

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

Chemoradiation
Treatment that combines chemotherapy with
radiation therapy is called chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy may improve how well radiation
works, and that is why they are sometimes
used together. Chemoradiation may be used to
control symptoms caused by a tumor, to shrink
the tumor before surgery, to prevent the return
of cancer after surgery, or as the primary
(main) treatment for the tumor.



Turmeric



Ginkgo biloba



Green tea extract



St. John’s Wort

Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care
medicines given during systemic therapy.
Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.
Bring a list with you to every visit.

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Systemic therapy

Immunotherapy

Chemotherapy and systemic
therapy are not the same.
Systemic therapy includes
chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy.

Immunotherapy can be given alone or with
other types of treatment. Immunotherapy is a
systemic treatment that tries to reactivate your
own immune system against tumor cells. The
immune system has many on and off switches.
Tumors take advantage of off switches. Some
immunotherapy examples are nivolumab
(Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda),
tislelizumab-jsgr (Tevimbra), and dostarlimabgxly (Jemperli).

Targeted therapy

More information on checkpoint inhibitors and
immunotherapy side effects is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop or inhibit
the action of molecules that help cancer cells
grow and/or survive and are often selected
based on NGS and IHC results.
Some examples of targeted therapies include:






Ramucirumab (Cyramza) targets VEGF
(vascular endothelial growth factor)
receptors.
Entrectinib (Rozlytrek) and larotrectinib
(Vitrakvi) are examples of TRK inhibitors
used for NTRK gene fusion-positive
tumors.
Trastuzumab (Herceptin), trastuzumab
deruxtecan (Enhertu), or a biosimilar
targeting HER2 overexpression-positive
tumors.

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy
Order of treatments

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, protons,
electrons, and other sources to kill cancer cells
and shrink tumors. RT can be given alone or
with other treatments. Unlike how drug therapy
travels throughout the whole body to treat a
tumor, radiation is a precisely targeted beam
on individual areas. It can be targeted on the
esophagus containing the tumor, the lymph
nodes containing the tumor, as well as nearby
areas that may have hidden tumor cells.

Most people with cancer will receive more
than one type of treatment. Below is an
overview of the order of treatments.

3 Preoperative or neoadjuvant

(before) therapy is given to shrink
the tumor before a primary treatment
such as surgery.

3 Perioperative therapy is systemic

RT can be used as the primary treatment for
esophageal cancer. It can also be given before
or after surgery to treat or slow the growth of
cancer, especially if the surgical margins have
cancer cells. RT may also be used to treat a
tumor that has spread (metastasized) to other
parts of your body. RT may also be used as
supportive care or palliative care to help ease
pain or discomfort caused by cancer, or to
control bleeding caused by a tumor.

therapy, such as chemotherapy, given
before and after surgery.

3 Primary treatment is the main
treatment given to rid the body of
cancer.

3 Postoperative or adjuvant (after)

therapy is given after primary
treatment to rid the body of any cancer
cells left behind from surgery. It is also
used when the risk of cancer returning
(recurrence) is felt to be high.

There are 2 main types of radiation treatment:




External beam radiation therapy
(EBRT) uses a machine outside of the
body to aim radiation at the tumor(s) or
areas of the body.

3 First-line therapy is the first set of
systemic (drug) treatment given.

3 Second-line therapy is the next set

of treatment given if cancer progresses
during or after systemic therapy.

Internal radiation is placed inside the
body as a solid like seeds. This is called
brachytherapy.

Talk to your care team about your treatment
plan and what it means for your stage and
type of cancer.

You won't feel radiation treatments while you're
receiving them, but side effects, in the area of
the body that is targeted, may develop over
time. Discuss the risks and side effects with
your care team.

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Clinical trials

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Finding a clinical trial

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

4 Treating esophageal cancer » Supportive care

Supportive care

It is important to tell your care
team about all side effects so
they can be managed.

Supportive care is health care given during
all cancer stages. It aims to prevent, reduce,
and relieve suffering, and to improve quality of
life. Supportive care might include pain relief,
emotional or spiritual support, financial aid,
or family counseling. Tell your care team how
you are feeling and about any side effects so
they can be managed. Best supportive care,
supportive care, and palliative care are terms
that are often used interchangeably.

Advance care planning starts with an honest
discussion with your care team about
the course your cancer will take called a
prognosis. Find out what you might expect if
your cancer spreads or worsens. Discuss the
medicines or therapies that will give you the
best quality of life and talk about your goals.
This dialogue with your care team should be
regular (more than once) and will help you
achieve your goals in your advance care
planning. Include family and friends in your
planning, too. Make your wishes clear. It is
important that everyone understands what you
want.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing activities that make you feel
energized. Strength is needed to sustain you
during treatment. And as much as you can,
you might find it helpful to keep the schedules
and activities you had before diagnosis.
After surgery, you may have problems such
as getting full too fast, heartburn and reflux,
stomach discomfort, bloating, nausea,
diarrhea, or dumping syndrome. The feeding
tube placed after surgery is usually temporary
during the recovery period. Some people
also experience discomfort or sticking when
swallowing foods. Nutrition plays an important
role in managing these symptoms.

You don’t have to know the exact details of
your prognosis. Just having a general idea
will help with planning. With this information,
you can decide if there is a point where you
might want to stop cancer treatment. You can
also decide what treatments you would want
for symptom relief, such as radiation therapy,
surgery, or medicine. You can change your
advance care plan at any time. What you want
today might change tomorrow. Making your
wishes clear will ensure everyone knows what
you want.

Advance care planning
Advance care planning is making decisions
now about the care you would want to receive
if you become unable to speak for yourself.
Advance care planning is for everyone, not
just for those who are very sick. It is a way
to ensure your wishes are understood and
respected.

Bleeding
Bleeding is common in those with esophageal
cancer. It may be caused by the tumor or a
result of treatment. Endoscopic treatment,

Embolization is the process of blocking blood
flow through a blood vessel. This is performed
by placing various materials through the
angiography catheter while it is inside the
blood vessel. The material can be a coil, small
beads, or liquid medicine that causes the blood
to clot and block the flow of blood.

radiation therapy (if not done before), or an
angiography with embolization might be used
to treat (stop) bleeding.
In angiography, a catheter (thin plastic tube)
is inserted into an artery through a small
incision in the skin and guided to the area
with the use of x-rays. A contrast material is
injected through the tube and x-ray images
produce a picture of the blood vessel called
an angiogram. It is often done when a blood
vessel has narrowed or suddenly becomes
blocked and does not allow blood to flow.

Blocked esophagus
A tumor may block the esophagus, the
esophagogastric junction (EGJ), or the
stomach. An esophageal stent is a metal or
plastic tube that widens the esophagus so food
can pass into the stomach.

Blocked esophagus An esophageal stent is a tube that widens the esophagus so food

can pass into the stomach (image on left). Special expanding (dilating) balloons or bougies
can relieve a blockage or a narrowing of the esophagus (image on right).

can also be used to alleviate a blockage.

Difficulty swallowing

Supportive care resources
More information on supportive care is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer
app.

Difficult or painful swallowing is called
dysphagia. Treatment such as ablation,
photodynamic therapy, radiation,
or placement of a stent may help
relieve pain and discomfort caused by
dysphagia.

Eating challenges
Sometimes side effects from surgery,
cancer, or other treatments might cause
you to feel not hungry or sick to your
stomach (nauseated). The tumor may
make it difficult to swallow food or liquids.
You might have a sore mouth. Healthy
eating is important during treatment. It
includes eating a balanced diet, eating
the right amount of food, and drinking enough
fluids. A registered dietitian who is an expert
in nutrition and food can help. Medicines are
available to treat poor appetite or nausea and
vomiting. Speak to your care team if you have
trouble eating or maintaining your weight.

Distress
Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt.
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping problems
are common in cancer. Talk to your doctor and
with those whom you feel most comfortable
about how you are feeling. There are services
and people who can help you. Support and
counseling services are available.

For long-term relief of anorexia, dysphagia, or
malnutrition, placement of a feeding tube might
help.

Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may be
caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of
treatment. There are treatments for fatigue.
Let your care team know how you are feeling
and if fatigue is getting in the way of doing
the things you enjoy. Eating a balanced diet,
exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage
therapy can help. You might be referred to a
nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue.

QOL

Nausea and vomiting

Cancer and its treatment can affect your
overall well-being or quality of life (QOL). For
more information on quality of life, see NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Palliative Care at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Nausea and vomiting are a common side
effect of treatment. You will be given medicine
to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting.

Pain
Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. Treating pain can be complicated.
You might meet with a palliative care specialist
or with a pain specialist to manage pain.
Pain is common in those with a tumor causing
a blockage or for metastatic esophageal
cancer. Severe abdominal pain can occur
when the tumor grows into nearby nerves or
presses against other organs. This pain is
treated with around-the-clock medicine such
as morphine or other opioids (narcotics).
Sometimes, non-narcotic medicines are used
to treat pain.

Treatment side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues. Such health issues are called
side effects. Side effects depend on many
factors. These factors include the drug type
and dose, length of treatment, and the person.
Some side effects may be harmful to your
health. Others may just be unpleasant.

Some people may benefit from palliative
radiation therapy, with or without systemic
therapy, to help relieve the pain. During this
treatment, a radiation beam is focused on the
tumor.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects.

Before starting treatment, you might be given
liquid nutrition through a tube. Treatment is
based on the size, grade, and location of the
tumor and your overall health.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
starts in the thin, flat cells found in the inner
lining of the esophagus. Squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) is often found in the upper
and middle esophagus. Location is defined by
the position of the center of the tumor in the
esophagus.

Surgery is an option
If you are healthy enough for surgery and do
not have any other serious health issues that
prevent surgery, then an endoscopic therapy
is preferred. An endoscopy therapy might be
endoscopic resection (ER) with or without
ablation or just ablation. An esophagectomy
might be an option as well.

Squamous cell carcinoma location might be
described as the cervical (neck region) or noncervical area of the esophagus. This chapter
is for those with early-stage or locoregional
(locally advanced) ESCC.

Treatment after a successful endoscopic
therapy (tumor completely removed
with negative margins) is surveillance.
Surveillance consists of testing on a regular
basis to watch for signs that cancer has
returned. It includes upper GI endoscopy
(esophagogastoduodenoscopy or EGD) testing
at regular intervals. Other tests might be done.
Treatment after an esophagectomy is based
on pathology results and performance status.

T = Tumor

If you are not healthy enough for surgery, the
tumor has spread (metastasized), or you do
not want surgery, then treatment may include
endoscopic resection with or without ablation,
or just ablation or chemoradiation.

A tumor can grow through the layers of the
esophagus wall and into nearby structures.
• Tis tumor is found in the epithelium
(or innermost) layer of the mucosa (first
layer).

Treatment after a successful endoscopic
therapy (tumor completely removed with
negative margins) is surveillance. Surveillance
includes upper GI endoscopy (or EGD) testing
at regular intervals. Other tests might be done.

• T1a tumor is found in the lamina
propria or muscularis mucosa layers of
the mucosa.
• T1b tumor is found in the submucosa
(second layer).

Locoregional

• T2 tumor is found in the muscularis
propria (third layer).

In locoregional disease, the tumor has grown
into the second layer (submucosa) or other
layers of the esophagus. Cancer may be in the
lymph nodes. Cancer found in lymph nodes is
called node-positive or nodal disease. Lymph
nodes must be biopsied or removed to confirm
cancer.

• T3 tumor is found in the adventitia
(outer layer). It has grown through the
other layers of the esophagus wall.
• T4 tumor has grown all the way
through the wall of the esophagus into
nearby structures.

Locoregional disease is staged before
surgery. This is called clinical stage (cTNM).
It is based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
and other imaging or biopsy results. Before
starting treatment, you might be given liquid
nutrition through a tube. Treatment is based
on the size, grade, and location of the tumor.
Important to note: The cervical esophagus is
the upper part of the esophagus or the neck
region. The non-cervical esophagus is the mid
to lower part of the esophagus.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

Tis and T1 tumors are often considered
early-stage cancer. Esophageal cancers are
rarely found this early.
T2, T3, and T4 tumors are often referred to
as locoregional disease. Cancer may be in
lymph nodes or structures near or in direct
contact with the esophagus.
In metastatic disease, the tumor can be
any size, cancer may be in lymph nodes,
and cancer has spread to other parts of the
body.

to see if any cancer remains. If no disease
remains, then you will enter observation or
have an esophagectomy. An esophagectomy
is preferred if disease remains.

An esophagectomy might be an option if
the tumor is not in the cervical esophagus,
the tumor is less than 3 centimeters (cm),
it has not grown beyond the second layer
(submucosa) of the esophagus wall, and there
is no cancer in the lymph nodes. Treatment
after an esophagectomy will be based on the
surgical margin results.

cT4b
For a tumor that has grown through the
layers of the esophagus wall into nearby
structures (cT4b), treatment is chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy alone might be possible if
cancer is found in the trachea (windpipe), large
vessels, spine, or heart.

For tumors 3 cm or more, node-positive
tumors, or tumors that have grown into or
beyond the third layer (muscularis propria) of
the esophagus wall, options include:

Preoperative chemoradiation followed by
an esophagectomy
Chemoradiation alone

After chemoradiation, you will have imaging
tests and upper GI endoscopy with biopsy

Standard of care is the best-known
way to treat a particular disease
based on past clinical trials. There
may be more than one treatment
regimen that is considered standard
of care. Ask your care team what
treatment options are available and if
a clinical trial might be right for you.

(anastomosed). An anastomotic stricture (or
stenosis) is a narrowing of the esophagus after
an esophagectomy. This can be managed with
endoscopic dilation.

Eat small portions and eat more often to cope
with feeling full after meals. Minimize high
fat and high fiber content in food. Also, avoid
drinking liquids with meals. Continue to drink
fluids in between meals. You might be referred
to a gastroenterologist for ongoing symptoms.

Dumping syndrome
Dumping syndrome occurs when food empties
into the small intestine too quickly. This may
happen within 30 minutes after eating a meal
(early dumping syndrome) or within 2 to 3
hours of eating (late dumping syndrome).

Heart issues
Because of the location of the esophagus,
radiation therapy for esophageal cancer may
cause heart issues. You should work with your
primary care doctor to monitor your blood
pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and weight.

Symptoms of early dumping syndrome include
palpitations, diarrhea, nausea, and cramps.
Late dumping syndrome tends to cause
dizziness, hunger, cold sweats, and faintness.

Indigestion

To help manage the symptoms of dumping
syndrome:


Eat often throughout the day.



Avoid drinking liquids with meals.



Indigestion is a general term that describes
discomfort in your upper abdomen. Indigestion
is also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach.
To prevent indigestion, avoid foods that
increase acid production such as citrus juices,
tomato sauces, and spicy foods.

Eat a diet high in protein and fiber and low
in simple carbohydrates and sugars.

Fatigue

Neuropathy

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability
to function due to lack of energy. There are
treatments for fatigue. Let your care team
know how you are feeling and if fatigue is
getting in the way of doing the things you
enjoy. A balanced diet, exercise, yoga, and
massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Esophageal Cancer, 2024

Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy caused by
chemotherapy is called chemotherapy-induced
neuropathy.

Cancer screening

Reflux
Reflux is the backward flow of liquid from the
stomach into the esophagus. Avoid lying flat
after eating. Use a foam wedge (triangular)
pillow in bed and sleep in a slightly upright
position at night. Talk to your doctor before
taking any over-the-counter (OTC) medicine.
Do not eat within 2 hours of bedtime.

Schedule cancer screenings and vaccinations
as recommended by your doctor based on
your age, risk, and other factors.
Screenings for cancer include:


Breast

Weight loss



Colorectal

Your weight will be monitored for changes.
You might weigh less after an esophagectomy.
Weight loss is expected in the first 6 months
after surgery. In addition, you will be monitored
to make sure you are getting enough nutrition,
and your body is absorbing the nutrition from
the food you eat.



Lung



Prostate

Key points


Healthy eating is very important. It includes
eating a balanced diet, eating the right amount
of food, and drinking enough fluids. Eat often
and avoid fluids with meals.



A registered dietitian who is an expert in
nutrition and food can help if you have trouble
eating, absorbing nutrition, or maintaining
weight.

Surgery and other treatments for
esophageal cancer can cause health
issues. Your health will be monitored.
A nutritionist or dietician provides
guidance on what foods are most suitable
for your condition.
Continue to see your primary health
care provider on a regular basis and
have preventive cancer screenings as
recommended by your doctor.
Eat often throughout the day (graze) and
avoid drinking liquids with meals.
Eat a mostly plant-based diet that is high
in protein and fiber and low in simple
carbohydrates and sugars.



Limit alcohol.



If you smoke or vape, seek help to quit.

relationship with your care team, it will help
you feel supported when considering options
and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:




What you want and how that might differ
from what others want

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Your religious and spiritual beliefs

Support groups



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.
