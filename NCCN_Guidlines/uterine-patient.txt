About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Uterine Neoplasms, Version 1.2023 — December 22, 2022.

The uterus

There are two main types of
uterine cancer. Endometrial

The uterus, also sometimes called the womb,
is part of the reproductive system. It is where
a baby grows and develops during pregnancy.
The uterus is normally about the size and
shape of a pear, and is hollow in the middle.
The other parts of the female reproductive
system are the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the
cervix, and the vagina.

cancer is common and can often
be cured with treatment. Uterine
sarcoma is rare and can be hard
to treat. Both are most often
diagnosed after menopause.

There is one ovary and one fallopian tube on
each side of the uterus. The fallopian tubes
connect to the top part of the uterus. The lower
part of the uterus is called the cervix. The
cervix connects the uterus to the vagina. Even
though the cervix is part of the uterus, cancer
of the cervix (cervical cancer) is diagnosed and
treated differently than uterine cancer. This
guide does not address cervical cancer.

The most effective treatment for
uterine cancer is surgery. It's
important to be comfortable with
your cancer care. Know that you
have a choice in your treatment.

The female reproductive
system
The uterus, cervix, vagina,
fallopian tubes, and
ovaries make up the female
reproductive system. The
uterus is where a baby
grows and develops during
pregnancy.

Two main types of uterine
cancer

The uterus has three main layers:






The endometrium is the thin layer of
tissue that lines the inside of the uterus.

There are two main types of cancer that start
in the uterus:

The myometrium is the muscular, middle
layer of the uterine wall.



The perimetrium, or serosa, is the thin,
outer lining of the uterus.



Endometrial carcinoma (endometrial
cancer)
Uterine sarcoma

The differences between these types of uterine
cancer are described next.

Endometrial cancer
Endometrial cancer is common and is often
found before it has spread beyond the uterus.
It is called endometrial cancer because it starts
in the endometrium, which is the inner lining of
the uterus.

Should I have been
getting tested for uterine
cancer?

The most common symptom of endometrial
cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding.
Often, this means bleeding during or after
menopause. Premenopausal patients may
have unusually long and/or heavy menstrual
bleeding (periods). For postmenopausal
patients, any vaginal bleeding is abnormal and
should be investigated to make sure it is not a
sign of cancer.

No. Testing for a disease when you
don't have any symptoms is called
"screening." For example, a Pap smear
is used to screen for cervical cancer
and a mammogram is used to screen
for breast cancer. There is currently no
screening test for endometrial cancer or
uterine sarcoma.

There are different types of endometrial
cancer. The most common type is called
endometrioid cancer. Most of the
information in this book and elsewhere on
endometrial cancer applies to endometrioid
cancer.
There are other, less common types of
endometrial cancer. They grow more quickly

Risk factors
After being diagnosed with cancer, it is normal
to wonder why it started. Some cancers are
hereditary. This means that a higher risk was
passed down to you by your parents through
your genes. For other cancers, lifestyle plays
a bigger role than genes. For many types of
cancer, both genes and lifestyle play a role
in whether you get that kind of cancer. The
medical term for something that increases the
chance of getting a disease is a risk factor.
Some endometrial cancer risk factors are
shown in the illustration below. Many are linked
to having too much estrogen in the body.

and are harder to treat. These high-risk
endometrial cancers include:


Serous carcinoma



Clear cell carcinoma





Undifferentiated/dedifferentiated
carcinoma
Carcinosarcoma, also known as
malignant mixed Müllerian tumor (MMMT)

Because these cancers are more aggressive,
they are treated differently than most
endometrioid cancers. These types are
addressed separately in Part 4: Endometrial
cancer treatment.

Endometrial cancer risk factors
Many of the risk factors for endometrial cancer are related to having too much of the hormone estrogen
in the body. Obesity is a major risk factor because fatty tissue in the body can change natural steroids in
your body into estrogen.

• Age 55 or older
• Obesity
• Too much estrogen
• Tamoxifen use
• Never gave birth
• Periods started early
• Periods stopped late
• Lynch syndrome

Uterine sarcoma

This guide discusses the tumor types listed
below, and others.

Uterine sarcoma starts in connective tissue
cells of the uterus. It often forms in the muscle
layer of the uterus (the myometrium), or in
connective tissue cells in the endometrium.
Uterine sarcomas are rare and may be harder
to treat than endometrial cancer. They are also
known as malignant mesenchymal tumors.
Like endometrial cancer, there are also
different types of uterine sarcomas.

treatment plan.

A complete blood count (CBC) is a common
blood test. It provides information about the
numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells,
and platelets in a sample of blood. Red blood
cells carry oxygen throughout the body. White
blood cells fight infection. Platelets help to
control bleeding. Your blood counts may
be high or low because of cancer or other
problems.

If uterine cancer is suspected or confirmed,
your doctor will do a complete physical exam.
This often includes a pelvic exam to check the
size and mobility of your uterus. Your doctor
will want to know a lot about on your past and
current health. They will also ask you about
symptoms that could be related to uterine
cancer, such as vaginal bleeding.

You may also have a blood test called a
chemistry profile. It measures the amount
of certain substances in the blood, such as
metabolites, electrolytes, fats, and proteins.
This test provides information about how
well your kidneys, liver, and other organs are
working.

Biopsy
Endometrial biopsy
If you have vaginal bleeding or other possible
symptoms of uterine cancer, an endometrial
biopsy is typically performed. This can
usually be done in your gynecologist’s office.
Endometrial biopsy involves removing a
sample of tissue from the lining of the uterus
(the endometrium). The removed tissue is
examined by a specialized doctor called a
pathologist. The pathologist determines the
cancer type and subtype, when possible.
Endometrial biopsy is much better at
diagnosing endometrial cancer than it is at
diagnosing uterine sarcoma.

Testing for uterine cancer » Imaging

Imaging

Chest x-ray
If endometrial cancer is suspected or
confirmed, you may have a chest x-ray. The
purpose is to look for signs of disease in and
around the chest. X-rays are painless and
use a very small amount of radiation. If any
abnormal or suspicious areas are found, a
computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest
may be ordered to get a better look. CT is
described next.

Ultrasound
Ultrasound uses sound waves to make
pictures of the inside of the body. It is good at
showing the size, shape, and location of the
uterus.
There are two types of ultrasounds that
may be used to evaluate uterine cancer.
In a transabdominal ultrasound, a gel will
be spread onto your stomach and the area
between your hip bones. The gel helps to
make the pictures clearer. Your doctor or
technician will place the probe on your skin
and guide it back and forth in the gel.

CT
You may have a CT scan of your chest,
abdomen, and pelvis. Your doctor is looking
for signs of cancer spread in these areas,
especially for higher-risk tumors.

For a transvaginal ultrasound, the probe will be
inserted into your vagina. This may help your
doctor see the uterus and nearby areas more
clearly. Ultrasounds are generally painless.
You may feel some discomfort when the probe
is inserted.

A CT scan is a more detailed kind of x-ray. It
takes many pictures from different angles. A
computer combines the images to make threedimensional (3-D) pictures.

the imaging machine. Cancer appears brighter
in the pictures because cancer cells use sugar
more quickly than normal cells.

During the scan, you will lie face up on a
table that moves through a large tunnellike machine. To see everything better, a
substance called contrast may be injected
into your vein. You may also be asked to
drink a liquid contrast to highlight the bowel.
Contrast makes the CT pictures clearer. The
contrast may cause you to feel flushed or get
hives. You will be alone during the scan, but
a technician will be nearby. You will be able to
hear and talk to the technician at all times. You
may hear buzzing or clicking during the scan.

Pelvic MRI
You may have magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) of your pelvis. An MRI can show the
tissues of the uterus and cervix closely. An
MRI may show whether the cancer has spread
to the cervix or other nearby organs. MRI
uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves
to make pictures of areas inside the body. It
is especially good at making clear pictures of
areas of soft tissue. Unlike a CT scan or chest
x-ray, MRI does not use radiation. Tell your
doctor if you get nervous in tight spaces.

PET/CT scan
If your doctor suspects that the cancer has
spread beyond the pelvis (metastasized),
CT may be combined with another imaging
test called positron emission tomography
(PET). PET uses small amounts of radioactive
materials called radiotracers. About an hour
before the scan, you will be injected with a
sugar radiotracer. The radiotracer gives off a
small amount of energy that can be seen by

cancer, and may be ordered for uterine
sarcomas. Testing is performed on either the
biopsy sample or on the tumor removed during
surgery. If the cancer is dMMR/MSI-H, you
may also be tested for Lynch syndrome.

Most endometrial cancers are caused by
random (non-hereditary) mutations in DNA.
Only about 5 out of 100 are due to an inherited
risk. However, your doctor will want to know
if you have a family history of cancer, or of
other diseases that can raise your risk of
getting cancer. Lynch syndrome, also known
as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer
(HNPCC), is an inherited cancer syndrome.

If the tumor does not have abnormal MMR
results but you have a strong family history of
endometrial and/or colorectal cancer, genetic
counseling and testing for inherited (germline)
mutations is recommended. If you have Lynch
syndrome or LFS, you will be monitored
closely and counseled on ways to reduce the
risk of getting other cancers.

Lynch syndrome is strongly linked to
colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, and other
cancers. Endometrial cancer tends to start
about 10 to 20 years earlier in those with
Lynch syndrome compared to those without
an inherited risk. Li-Fraumeni syndrome
(LFS) is another hereditary cancer risk
syndrome. People with LFS are at higher risk
of developing uterine sarcoma. To determine
who should be tested for Lynch syndrome,
the tumor is tested for mismatch repair (MMR)
protein expression.

Tumor tissue tests
Hormone receptor testing
Some cancer cells have proteins to which the
hormones estrogen and progesterone can
attach. These proteins are called receptors.
Once attached, the hormones may help
the cancer grow or inhibit growth. Knowing
whether the tumor cells have hormone
receptors may affect treatment planning.

Mismatch repair (MMR)

Testing involves analyzing a small piece of the
tumor in a lab. If the tumor cells have hormone
receptors, the cancer is called estrogen and/
or progesterone receptor “positive.” Hormone
receptor testing is recommended for most
uterine sarcomas, and for recurrent or
advanced endometrial cancer.

In normal cells, a process called MMR fixes
errors that happen when the DNA divides and
makes a copy of itself. If a cell’s MMR system
isn’t working right, errors build up and cause
the DNA to become unstable. This is called
microsatellite instability (MSI).
There are two kinds of lab tests for this
biomarker. Depending on the method used, an
abnormal result is called either microsatellite
instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repairdeficient (dMMR). Tumors that are not dMMR/
MSI-H are referred to as microsatellite stable
(MSS) or mismatch repair proficient (pMMR).
MMR/MSI testing is recommended for
everyone diagnosed with endometrial
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Uterine Cancer, 2023

HER2
HER2 is a protein found on the surface of
cells. Some endometrial cancers have too
much of a protein called HER2. This causes
the cancer to grow and spread quickly. HER2
testing is recommended for certain advanced
or recurrent high-risk endometrial tumors.

cancer. This process is called surgical staging.
The cancer stage helps your doctors decide if
you need further treatment after surgery.

Minimally invasive surgery involves making
only a few small cuts into your body to do the
surgery. With minimally invasive surgery there
is usually less pain and scarring. Also, the time
it takes to recover is usually shorter compared
to surgery that uses a larger cut through the
abdomen. Minimally invasive surgery may be
an option depending on the type and extent of
the uterine cancer.

There are two systems used to stage uterine
cancer—the International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system
and the American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM)
system. Both systems use the following key
pieces of information about your cancer in
order to give it a stage:

Sometimes the tumor ends up being larger
than expected or spreads to other locations.
In this case, tumor debulking may be an
appropriate treatment.
In tumor debulking surgery, the surgeon
attempts to remove all cancer that can be seen
or felt. Tumor debulking surgery is considered
successful if all tumor is removed, or if all
tumor is removed except implants measuring
up to 1 cm (optimal debulking).

There are four main stages of endometrial
cancer and uterine sarcoma. The stages of
each are described in more detail next. In
general, people with earlier cancer stages
have better outcomes, but not always. Some
people will do better than expected for their
stage, and some people will do worse.

When it is safe, debulking is a good idea for
endometrial cancer because it may mean that
other treatments have a better chance of killing
the leftover tumor cells.

Endometrial cancer stages

Surgical staging

There are four main stages of endometrial
cancer in the FIGO staging system: I, II, III,
and IV. Some of the stages are broken down
into sub-stages that have letters and may
also have a number. Examples are stage IIIB
and stage IIIC2. The stages are shown in the
illustrations on the following pages.

During surgery, your surgeon will look very
closely at the tissues and organs closest to the
pelvis for signs of cancer and take samples of
any suspicious areas for testing.
Your surgeon may put fluid in the open space
of your abdomen and then remove it to see
if it has cancer cells. This is called peritoneal
washing. Lymph nodes are often removed and
tested for cancer. This may be done using a
procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy.
The information gained first-hand during
surgery is used, along with tests done before
surgery, to determine the stage (extent) of the

you stay still during the radiation sessions.
Pictures of the cancer sites will be obtained
with a CT scan. Using the CT scan pictures
and sophisticated computer software, your
radiation oncologist will make a treatment
plan to aim radiation beams at the tumor and
nearby lymph nodes. The plan will describe
the best radiation dose for you, as well as the
number of sessions you will need.

Radiation therapy uses high-energy waves
similar to x-rays to kill cancer cells. It is a
commonly used treatment for both endometrial
cancer and uterine sarcoma. The types of
radiation therapy that may be used to treat
uterine cancer are described next. You may
have treatment with more than one type.

External beam radiation therapy

During treatment, you will lie on a table as you
did for simulation. Devices may be used to
keep you from moving. This helps to target the
tumor. Ink marks on your skin will help position
your body accurately for daily treatments.
You will be alone in the treatment room. A
technician will operate the machine from a
nearby room. The technician will be able to
see, hear, and speak with you at all times. As
treatment is given, you may hear noises. You
will not see, hear, or feel the radiation. One
session takes about 20 minutes and the beam
is on for about two minutes.

In external beam radiation therapy (EBRT),
a large machine aims radiation at the cancer
site. The radiation passes through skin and
other tissue to reach the tumor. EBRT is
given in small doses, called fractions. For the
treatment of uterine cancer, EBRT is typically
given 5 days a week for 5 to 6 weeks.
A planning session, called simulation, is
needed before treatment begins. You will first
be placed in the treatment position. You will
be asked to lie on your back and stay very
still. You may get fitted for a prop to help

Survivorship for information on ways to help
prevent, limit, or manage these effects.

IMRT
An advanced type of EBRT called intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may be
used to treat uterine cancer. IMRT uses many
small beams of different strengths. This allows
a high dose of radiation to be targeted at the
tumor while limiting the amount of radiation
to the surrounding normal tissue. With IMRT
it is possible to reduce radiation to important
nearby organs and structures, such as the
bowel and bladder. This can help reduce
treatment-related side effects.

Brachytherapy
Another type of radiation therapy used for
uterine cancer is called brachytherapy, or
internal radiation. It is called internal because
the cancer-fighting radioactive material is put
inside your body, either directly into the tumor
or close to it. Hollow tubes are placed in the
vagina or uterus and a small radiation pellet
travels to the region of the tumor. This may be
done several times to deliver a safe dose.

SBRT
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a
highly specialized type of EBRT. It may be
used to treat endometrial cancer that has
spread to the liver, lungs, or bone. High doses
of radiation are delivered to a metastatic site
or sites using very precise beams. SBRT is
typically delivered in 5 or fewer sessions.
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
SRS is a non-surgical and highly precise type
of radiation therapy. It can be used to treat
small brain or spine tumors.
Side effects
Common side effects at the treatment site
during the 5 to 6 weeks of external radiation
treatment include skin irritation, tenderness,
and redness. Other short-term side effects
of radiation therapy include fatigue, diarrhea,
frequent urination or pain while urinating, and
nausea. Most of these decrease over time
when treatment is over. Radiation therapy side
effects may not be felt right away. They may
appear and worsen later in the cycle or even
after it is complete.
Radiation therapy for uterine cancer can
also have long-term and possibly serious
side effects on fertility, sexual health, and
bowel and bladder function. See Part 6:

Treatments for uterine cancer » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

Endocrine therapy

Systemic therapy is treatment with substances
that travel in the bloodstream, reaching and
affecting cells throughout the body. Types
of systemic therapy include chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and
endocrine therapy.

Estrogen and progesterone are hormones.
They can affect the growth of cancer cells
in the uterus. Endocrine therapy is a type of
cancer treatment that changes the levels of
certain hormones in the body. It’s not the same
as the hormone therapy that may be used
to manage symptoms of menopause, called
hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

Chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy

The types of endocrine therapy that may be
used for uterine cancer are described next.

Chemotherapy is the most commonly used
type of systemic therapy for uterine cancer.
It stops the growth of cancer cells, either
by killing the cells or by stopping them from
dividing. Most chemotherapy drugs are given
by infusion. This means they are liquids slowly
injected into the bloodstream through a vein.

Progestins are lab-made versions of the
hormone progesterone. They help slow the
growth of endometrial cancer cells. Progestins
used to treat some uterine cancers include:


Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are
newer types of systemic therapy. They may
be treatment options for uterine cancer that
does not respond to chemotherapy, returns
after treatment with chemotherapy (recurrent),
or spreads beyond the pelvis (metastatic).
Unlike chemotherapy, targeted therapy
and immunotherapy are most effective at
treating cancers with specific features, called
biomarkers.




Megestrol acetate – taken orally
Levonorgestrel (Mirena), a progestinreleasing intrauterine device (IUD)

Aromatase inhibitors are oral medications.
They can stop estrogen from being made by
fatty tissue in the body. As a result, the overall
amount of estrogen in the body is lowered.
Aromatase inhibitors include:

Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and
immunotherapy can kill healthy cells in addition
to cancer cells. The damage to healthy cells
causes potentially harsh side effects, such as
hair loss, cracked skin, and mouth sores.



Anastrozole (Arimidex)



Letrozole (Femara)



Exemestane (Aromasin)

Tamoxifen is a drug used to reduce the
amount of estrogen in the body. It is taken
orally. Tamoxifen is not used for uterine
sarcoma.

These types of systemic therapy are often
given in cycles of treatment days followed by
days of rest. This allows your body to recover
before the next cycle. For example, you might
receive chemotherapy every day for 1 week
followed by 3 weeks with no chemotherapy.
These 4 weeks make up one cycle. Cycles vary
in length depending on which drugs are used.

Uterine Cancer, 2023

Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) –
taken orally

Fulvestrant (Faslodex) blocks estrogen
receptors that can cause cancer cells to grow.
Fulvestrant is given by injection (shot).

Side effects
Endocrine therapy can cause side effects.
Symptoms of menopause are common. Such
symptoms include hot flashes, changes in
mood, vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and
night sweats. Other common side effects of
endocrine therapy are vaginal discharge,
weight gain, swelling in the hands and feet,
fatigue, and reduced interest in sex. Blood
clots are a rare but serious side effect of
tamoxifen. Aromatase inhibitors can weaken
your bones and may also cause joint and
muscle pain.

common and rare side effects of each
systemic therapy you are receiving.

Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Uterine Cancer, 2023

Phase I trials study the safety and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.

Endometrioid cancer

This chapter presents the
recommended treatment options

Cancer is only in the uterus

for endometrial cancer. Treatment

Endometrial cancer is often found before it has
spread beyond the body of the uterus. In this
case, the most effective treatment is surgery.
If you are willing and able to have surgery, a
total hysterectomy (TH) with bilateral salpingooophorectomy (BSO) is recommended. TH
removes the uterus and cervix. It is necessary
to remove the cervix because uterine cancer
can extend into the cervix. BSO removes both
ovaries and fallopian tubes. It may be possible
to keep your ovaries. Ovary preservation is
discussed more below.

for the most common type of
endometrial tumor (endometrioid)
is discussed first, followed by
treatment for high-risk types.

Before starting treatment, it is important to
know if the cancer has spread. If it has (and
how far) plays a role in how it is treated. There
are three main possibilities:





Carrying a pregnancy is not possible after
a hysterectomy. If pregnancy is possible
and desired, fertility-sparing treatment may
be an option. See the next page for more
information.

The cancer is only in the main part of the
uterus (not the cervix).
The cancer has grown into the cervix.
The cancer has spread beyond the uterus
into other parts of your body.

When possible, minimally invasive surgery is
preferred for endometrioid cancer that has not
spread beyond the body of the uterus. During
surgery, your surgeon will assess the extent
of the cancer and remove tissue and lymph
nodes for testing. The results of surgery and
testing are used to stage the cancer. This is
called surgical staging. The stage is used to
determine treatment needed after surgery. See
Treatment after surgery on page 36 for next
steps.

Treatment for each of these scenarios is
discussed next.

Ovary preservation
Prior to menopause, the ovaries produce
the hormones estrogen and progesterone.
Removing the ovaries causes a sudden
loss of estrogen. This is known as surgical
menopause. Side effects of surgical
menopause include hot flashes, sleeping
problems, changes in mood, and vaginal
atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

the lining of the vagina becomes thin, dry, and
inflamed.

diagnosed with endometrial cancer, this can be
hard to accept.

There are also long-term risks of not having
enough estrogen. These include heart or blood
vessel problems (cardiovascular disease) and
bone loss (osteoporosis).

If you have low-risk endometrial cancer and
want to treat the cancer, but also want to try
to have a child in the future, fertility-sparing
treatment may be an option. It involves
delaying surgery and treating the cancer with
hormone therapy first. If hormone therapy
works well and kills all of the cancer, you can
try to become pregnant.

If you are premenopausal, it may be safe for
you to keep your ovaries. This is called ovarian
preservation. This may be an option if:


The cancer is stage I



Your ovaries look normal on imaging tests



Fertility-sparing therapy is only an option for
some low-risk endometrial cancers. It may be
an option if:

You do not have a family history of
breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or Lynch
syndrome



If you are able to keep your ovaries, it is still
recommended that the fallopian tubes be
removed with the uterus.





You decline or cannot have surgery first
If you do not want surgery or are unable to
have it for other health reasons, treatment
with radiation therapy is preferred. External
beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy
(internal radiation), or both may be used.





Another option is endocrine (hormone) therapy.
Hormone therapy is typically only considered
for small or slow-growing endometrioid tumors.
Oral progestins such as medroxyprogesterone
acetate (Provera) and megestrol acetate
are preferred. In some cases, a progestinreleasing intrauterine device (IUD) may be a
better option. Mirena is an example. It contains
the progestin levonorgestrel.





Fertility-sparing therapy
Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, fallopian
tubes, and ovaries is the standard treatment
for endometrial cancer that has not spread
beyond the uterus. Carrying a pregnancy is
not possible without a uterus. For some people
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Uterine Cancer, 2023

The tumor is endometrioid (the most
common type).
Imaging tests show that the cancer does
not extend beyond the endometrium.
The cancer cells are grade 1. This means
that they look similar to healthy cells
under a microscope.
There are no medical reasons why you
cannot (or should not) get pregnant.
There are no medical reasons why you
cannot or should not have hormone
therapy. Contraindications to hormone
therapy include stroke, myocardial
infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep
vein thrombosis, and smoking.
You fully understand that fertility-sparing
therapy is not the standard treatment for
endometrial cancer.
You agree to regular endometrial biopsies
to check if the treatment is working.

Before starting fertility-sparing therapy,
consulting with a fertility expert is
recommended. You may also have genetic
counseling and testing.

32

Endometrial cancer treatment » Endometrioid cancer

If hormone therapy works well and the cancer
is gone after 6 months, you can stop hormone
therapy and begin trying to get pregnant.
While you are trying to get pregnant, you will
continue to have testing of your endometrium
every 6 months.

It is important to maintain a healthy weight and
lifestyle during fertility-sparing therapy. It may
lead to better treatment outcomes. Expect your
doctor to ask about your diet, level of activity,
and other lifestyle-related factors.
There are 3 options for hormone therapy.
All use artificial versions of the hormone
progesterone:





If hormone therapy was successful but you
do not start trying to conceive right away, your
doctor may recommend continuing progestinbased hormone therapy in order to maintain
the good results. If the cancer returns while
you are trying to get pregnant, your doctor will
recommend that you have the surgery.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) –
taken orally
Megestrol acetate – taken orally
Progestin intrauterine device (IUD), such
as Mirena

If the hormone therapy does not work and
the cancer is still there after 6 to 12 months,
surgery is recommended. Keeping your
ovaries may be an option.

To see if hormone therapy is working, a tissue
sample will be removed from the endometrium
every 3 to 6 months for testing. This is done
using endometrial biopsy or dilation and
curettage (a “D&C”).

Intrauterine device (IUD)
An IUD that releases
levonorgestrel is one method
of hormone therapy used in
fertility-sparing therapy.

Endometrial cancer treatment » Endometrioid cancer

Cancer has spread to the cervix

treatment with radiation (and chemotherapy, if
given) works well, surgery may be an option if
you agree to have it.

If a cervical biopsy or pelvic magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) shows that the
cancer has grown into the cervix, treatment
options depend on whether surgery can be
performed first. When possible, having surgery
first is preferred.

Another option for those who cannot have
surgery first is chemotherapy alone to try to
shrink the cancer. The regimen preferred at
this time is carboplatin and paclitaxel together.
If it works well, surgery may be an option. If
surgery is still not possible, treatment with both
EBRT and brachytherapy is recommended.

If you agree to surgery and are healthy enough
to have it, either a total hysterectomy or a
radical hysterectomy is recommended, along
with BSO to remove the fallopian tubes and
ovaries.

Cancer has spread beyond the
uterus

Your surgeon will assess the extent of the
cancer during surgery and remove tissue
and lymph nodes for testing. Pathologists will
examine the removed tissue and determine
the cancer stage. This is known as surgical
staging. The stage is used to determine
treatment needed after surgery. See
Treatment after surgery on page 36 for next
steps.

Treating cancer that has spread beyond the
uterus depends on how far the cancer has
spread and whether it can be removed with
surgery first.
You are willing and able to have surgery
first
If the cancer has not spread beyond the pelvis
or abdomen, total hysterectomy and BSO are
recommended. Your surgeon will try to remove
as much of the cancer as possible. Some
people have chemotherapy before surgery to
try to shrink the tumor.

In some cases, both EBRT and brachytherapy
may be used first to try to shrink the cancer
before surgery. However, going straight to
surgery is usually advised when possible. If
radiation therapy is given before surgery, it will
not be given again after surgery. See When
treatment is over on page 40 for next steps.

During surgery, your surgeon will assess the
extent of the cancer and remove tissue and
lymph nodes for testing. Pathologists will
examine the removed tissue and determine
the cancer stage. This is known as surgical
staging. The stage is used to determine
treatment needed after surgery. Endometrial
cancer that has spread beyond the uterus is
either stage III or IV. See Treatment after
surgery on page 36.

You decline or cannot have surgery first
If you do not want to have surgery or are
unable to have it for other health reasons,
there are other treatment options. Most
commonly, radiation therapy is used first
to try to shrink the tumor. Both EBRT and
brachytherapy are given. Platinum-based
chemotherapy may be given in addition to
radiation therapy. When given with radiation,
chemotherapy can make it easier for radiation
to kill cancer cells. The combined use of
these treatments is called chemoradiation. If

Uterine Cancer, 2023

If the cancer has spread to areas far from
the pelvis (metastasized), systemic therapy
is recommended. At this time, the preferred
regimen is carboplatin and paclitaxel
together. EBRT may be used in addition to
34

Endometrial cancer treatment » Endometrioid cancer

chemotherapy. Surgery (total hysterectomy
and BSO) may also be considered, but
not with the goal of curing the cancer. The
purpose is to relieve symptoms caused by
the cancer and further limit its spread. This is
called palliative surgery. If surgery is planned,
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
may be used to destroy small metastatic
tumors. See When treatment is over on page
40 for next steps.

Is endometrial cancer
hereditary?
Not usually. Most cases of endometrial
cancer are caused by random (nonhereditary) mutations in DNA. Only
about 5 out of 100 endometrial
cancers are due to an inherited risk.
This includes people with an inherited
disorder called Lynch syndrome. People
with Lynch syndrome have a high risk
(about 60%) of getting endometrial
cancer in their lifetime. Patients with
Lynch syndrome should be monitored
closely and counseled on ways to
reduce the risk of getting endometrial
and other cancers.

You decline or cannot have surgery first
If you do not want surgery or cannot have it
for other health reasons, treatment options
depend on how far the cancer has spread. If
the cancer has not spread beyond the pelvis
or abdomen, EBRT may be recommended.
Brachytherapy, systemic therapy, or both may
be given in addition to external radiation. If
treatment works well, surgery may be possible
if you are willing to have it.
If the cancer has metastasized, systemic
therapy is recommended. If it works well,
surgery may be possible if you are willing to
have it. Otherwise, treatment with radiation
therapy may be an option.

treatments. After any treatment given after
surgery, follow-up care begins.

The treatment(s) you may have after surgery
are described next, according to the stage.
This information applies to endometrioid
cancers only.

Stage II
Radiation therapy is recommended after
surgery for all stage II endometrial cancers.
EBRT is preferred. Vaginal brachytherapy is
also an option and may be given alone or in
addition to EBRT. Vaginal brachytherapy alone
may be considered for very low-risk stage II
cancers. In some cases, either chemotherapy
or hormone therapy is given in addition to
EBRT and/or vaginal brachytherapy. Hormone
therapy is typically only considered for small or
slow-growing endometrioid tumors. After postsurgery treatment(s), follow-up care begins.

Stage I
Treatment is recommended after surgery for
some stage I endometrioid cancers. Your
doctor will consider the factors listed below to
determine if more treatment may help lower
the risk of the cancer returning.








The cancer stage (IA or IB)
The cancer grade (how abnormal the
tumor cells look under a microscope)

Stage III and IV
The main treatment after surgery for stage
III and IV endometrioid cancer is systemic
therapy. Either chemotherapy or hormone
therapy may be used. Hormone therapy is
typically only considered for small or slowgrowing endometrioid tumors. In addition to
systemic therapy, you may also have EBRT
and/or vaginal brachytherapy. After systemic
therapy (and radiation, if given), follow-up care
begins.

Your age
How far the tumor extends into the
muscle layer of the uterus (if at all)
Whether there are tumor cells in the blood
vessels or lymph vessels outside of the
main tumor, known as lymphovascular
space invasion (LVSI). If there are, it
means that the cancer is more likely to
have spread to the lymph nodes.

After weighing these factors, your doctor may
decide that you don’t need more treatment. In
this case, a watch-and-wait approach is used.
Surveillance will begin.
If you do need more treatment, the main
treatments used after surgery for stage I
endometrial cancer are:

EBRT

For some high-grade, stage IB endometrioid
tumors, chemotherapy may be given

has, CA-125 testing may also be used to see if
treatment is working.
For advanced or metastatic serous carcinoma
or carcinosarcoma tumors, HER2 testing is
also recommended.

Most endometrial cancers are found early and
respond well to treatment. Other, less common
types can spread quickly and are harder to
treat. At the time of diagnosis, these high-risk
endometrial cancers may have already spread
beyond the uterus.

The most effective treatment for high-risk
endometrial cancers is surgery. A total
hysterectomy with BSO is recommended.
Surgical staging will be performed to learn
the extent of the cancer and assign a stage.
When possible, minimally invasive surgery is
preferred.

High-risk endometrial cancers include:


Serous carcinoma



Clear cell carcinoma



Carcinosarcoma



Fertility-sparing therapy is not recommended
for these tumor types. If you are not a
candidate for surgery, see page 39.

Undifferentiated/dedifferentiated
carcinoma

Treatment after surgery

Carcinosarcomas appear under the
microscope as part endometrial carcinoma and
part uterine sarcoma. They are also known
as malignant mixed mesodermal tumors or
malignant mixed Müllerian tumors (MMMTs).

Treatment is almost always needed after
surgery for high-risk endometrial cancer.
Recommended treatment options depend on
the tumor type and stage.
Serous and clear cell carcinoma
If all of the cancer is removed during surgery,
no further treatment is needed. Observation is
recommended.

Like endometrioid tumors, the first sign
of high-risk endometrial tumors is vaginal
bleeding. However, these kinds of endometrial
cancer can also cause the following signs and
symptoms:


Lumps in the pelvis area



Abnormal Pap smear results



For non-invasive stage IA disease,
treatment after surgery depends on the results
of peritoneal washing (“washings”). Your
surgeon will put fluid in the open space of your
abdomen and then remove it to see if it has
cancer cells. If no cancer cells are found, it
is called “negative washings.” Treatment with
vaginal brachytherapy is one recommended
option. If brachytherapy is planned,
chemotherapy is sometimes also given.
Observation is also an option if the washings
are negative.

Fluid buildup or swelling in the abdomen
(also known as ascites)

Testing can help determine if the cancer has
spread beyond the uterus. If you have not had
imaging tests, expect to have them before
treatment. Your doctor may also order a cancer
antigen 125 (CA-125) blood test. A high level
of this substance in the blood may mean that
the cancer has spread beyond the uterus. If it

If you cannot have surgery first
Surgery may not be planned for one or
more reasons. It may not be possible to
surgically remove the cancer. Or, you may
not be able to have surgery because of
other health problems. Or, you may not want
surgery. In any of these cases, there are two
main treatment options for most high-risk
endometrial cancers.
The first option is external radiation therapy.
Vaginal brachytherapy, chemotherapy, or both
may be given in addition to radiation therapy.
After treatment, your doctor will check the size
of the tumor to see if surgery is possible.
The second option is systemic therapy alone.
Chemotherapy is typically given. The goal of
systemic therapy is to shrink the tumor enough
to be surgically removed. After treatment, your
doctor will check the size of the tumor to see if
surgery and/or radiation therapy is possible.

suspicion that the cancer has returned or
spread.

Surveillance begins when there are no signs of
cancer after treatment. It is used to find early
signs that cancer has returned. See Guide 3.

Other care

Physical exams

In addition to surveillance testing, a range
of other care is important for uterine cancer
survivors. This includes learning how to
spot symptoms of recurrence. See Part 6:
Survivorship for more information.

Physical exams are the main method of
surveillance for endometrial cancer. Expect
to have them on a regular basis. In the first 2
to 3 years after treatment, a physical exam is
recommended every 3 to 6 months. Exams
are then spaced out to every 6 to 12 months
through the fifth year after treatment. After year
5, a physical exam is recommended annually.

Other surveillance testing
If your CA-125 level was high before
treatment, it may be measured as part of
surveillance testing. Imaging tests are ordered
on an as-needed basis after treatment for
endometrial cancer. You may need an imaging

can also be used to determine whether you
meet the criteria for joining certain clinical
trials.

The return of cancer is called a recurrence or
a relapse. If recurrence is suspected based
on your symptoms or physical exam findings,
imaging tests are needed. You may have one
or more of the following imaging tests.


Testing for biomarkers involves analyzing
a piece of tumor tissue in a lab or testing a
sample of blood. Testing for biomarkers may
be performed individually, or as part of a larger
panel (group). Testing for many biomarkers at
one time is called next-generation sequencing
(NGS).

CT scan of your abdomen, pelvis, and/or
chest with contrast



PET/CT of your whole body



MRI of your abdomen and pelvis

Other names for biomarker testing include
molecular testing, tumor profiling, genomic
testing, tumor gene testing, somatic genomic
testing, and mutation testing.

Treatment for recurrence depends in part on
the location of the new cancer growth. After
total hysterectomy and BSO, endometrial
cancer may return to the vagina. Treatment will
depend on whether the cancer is only in the
vagina or also in nearby areas or organs.

dMMR/MSI-H
All endometrial cancers should be tested
for mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)/high
microsatellite instability (MSI-H). If the cancer
has this biomarker, you may also be tested
for an inherited cancer syndrome called
Lynch syndrome. Tumors that are not dMMR/
MSI-H are referred to as microsatellite stable
(MSS) or mismatch repair proficient (pMMR).
See page 14 for more information on this
biomarker.

The treatments you’ve already had will also
be considered. External radiation therapy, for
example, is generally not used to treat the
same area more than once.
If recurrence is confirmed and biomarker
testing has not yet been done, it is
recommended at this time.

Less common biomarkers
You may also have testing for the less
common biomarkers listed below.

Biomarkers
Biomarkers are specific features of a cancer.
Testing for these features looks for targetable
changes to help guide your care. Biomarkers
are often mutations (changes) in particular
genes. They can also be proteins that are
made in response to the cancer.
Biomarker testing is different than genetic
testing of the blood for inherited (germline)
mutations. Mutations in the tumor or cancer
itself are called somatic, acquired, or simply
tumor mutations. If any are found, treatment
with certain targeted or immunotherapies may
be an option. The results of biomarker testing

Local recurrence

Distant recurrence

If endometrial cancer returns to the vagina,
pelvis, or abdomen, it is a “local” recurrence.
Your treatment options will depend on whether
you’ve had radiation therapy at the cancer
site. If the cancer site has not been treated
with EBRT, it is one recommended option.
Brachytherapy and/or systemic therapy may
be given in addition to EBRT.

If endometrial cancer returns after initial
treatment and is found in other areas of the
body, such as the liver or lungs, it is known as
a distant recurrence. The cancer is metastatic.
The new cancer growths, or tumors, are called
metastases.
If there are only a few metastases, it may be
possible to remove or destroy the tumors using
one or more of the local therapies listed below.

Another option for those with no prior external
radiation treatment at the recurrence site is
exploratory surgery. This involves opening
the abdomen to learn how far the cancer has
spread and to surgically remove it. If surgery
finds that the cancer is only in the vagina or
has spread to nearby lymph nodes, EBRT
is recommended after surgery. Systemic
therapy may be given in addition to EBRT. If
the new cancer growth is limited to the vagina,
brachytherapy will be considered.



EBRT
Stereotactic body radiation therapy
(SBRT) for metastases

If there are more than a few new areas
of cancer growth, systemic therapy is
recommended. Radiation therapy may also be
given with the goal of relieving symptoms. This
is known as palliative radiation therapy.
At this time, the preferred chemotherapy
regimen for recurrent and/or metastatic
endometrial cancer is carboplatin and
paclitaxel. A targeted therapy called
trastuzumab may be added for HER2-positive
serous or carcinosarcoma tumors. If you
cannot have paclitaxel, docetaxel may be
given instead.
If the cancer does not respond or stops
responding to first-line systemic therapy,
there are other options. If the tumor has
certain biomarkers, immunotherapy or
targeted therapy may be an option. These
newer systemic therapies are generally only
considered for cancers that return or spread
after chemotherapy and for which there are

Supportive care
If the cancer progresses during systemic

treatment, supportive care is an option.
Because the cancer cannot be cured, the
goal of supportive care is to make you more

First steps

This chapter presents
recommended treatment options

Imaging

for a rare type of uterine cancer

Imaging tests are needed before starting
treatment. A computed tomography (CT) scan
of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis (with
contrast) is recommended. You may also have
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your
pelvis, abdomen, or both.

called uterine sarcoma. Testing,
treatment, and follow-up care are
explained.

Other imaging tests that may be used to
evaluate spread of cancer include combined
positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan
of your neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and
groin. Whether you need other imaging tests
will depend on your symptoms and whether
your doctor thinks the cancer has spread
(metastasized).

Uterine sarcoma starts in the supporting
connective tissues or muscles of the uterus.
This type often has a higher chance of
spreading and may be harder to treat than
endometrial cancer.
Uterine sarcomas differ from endometrial
cancer in that they are often found after a
hysterectomy. This is because there are limited
ways to diagnose uterine sarcomas prior to
hysterectomy.

Hormone receptor testing
The ovaries make hormones. If the sarcoma
is hormone receptor-positive, it means that
hormones may help the cancer to grow.
Hormone receptor testing helps decide
whether the ovaries should be removed. This
is decided on a case-by-case basis for those
of childbearing age. Hormone receptor testing
is typically considered for ESS, uLMS, and
adenosarcomas. Testing is performed on either
the biopsy sample or on tumor tissue removed
during surgery.

There are different types of uterine sarcomas.
The following types are discussed in this book:


Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS)



Adenosarcoma



Uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS)



Undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (UUS)

Treatment

Possible spread beyond the uterus
If the cancer has (or may have) spread beyond
the uterus, surgery will be considered. Your
surgeon will consider the extent of the cancer,
your symptoms, and how well the cancer can
be removed with surgery. If surgery is planned,
a total hysterectomy is recommended. The
cancer that has spread beyond the uterus will
also be removed if possible. Your ovaries and
fallopian tubes may also be removed. This is
decided on a case-by-case basis for those
of reproductive age. If the cancer is hormone
receptor positive, your doctor is likely to
recommend removing them. See Treatment
after surgery on the next page.

Treatment of a uterine sarcoma depends on
how it was found. They are often found after
a hysterectomy. Sometimes pathologists
are able to diagnose uterine sarcomas by
testing a sample of tissue (a biopsy). But,
biopsy is not as reliable for identifying uterine
sarcomas as it is for endometrial cancer. This
is because sarcomas are often located deep
in the muscular wall of the uterus. A third
way that a uterine sarcoma may be found is
during surgery to remove fibroids. Fibroids
are noncancerous tumors that can grow in the
uterus and cause symptoms.
In those with a uterus, total hysterectomy
and possibly bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
(BSO) is the most effective way to treat a
uterine sarcoma. If the cancer cannot be
removed with surgery, treatment options
include radiation therapy and systemic therapy.

Having surgery first is not an option
If you don’t want or can't have surgery,
treatment with systemic therapy, palliative
external radiation therapy, or both is
recommended. Brachytherapy may be used in
addition to one or both of these treatments.

Sarcoma found by biopsy or
fibroid removal

Chemotherapy is often given first for
systemic therapy. For tumors with certain
biomarkers, other systemic therapy that
targets the biomarker may be given instead.
Recommended first-line systemic therapy
options for inoperable sarcomas are listed in
Guide 5 on page 50.

Cancer is only in the uterus
If the cancer is only in the uterus, a total
hysterectomy is recommended. Your ovaries
and fallopian tubes may also be removed (a
BSO). This is decided on a case-by-case basis
for those of reproductive age. If the cancer
is hormone receptor-positive, your doctor is
likely to recommend removing them. If you are
post-menopausal, a BSO is recommended.
If, during surgery, it is discovered that cancer
has spread beyond the uterus, you may have
more surgery to remove it. This decision is
also made on a case-by-case basis. See
Treatment after surgery on the next page.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Uterine Cancer, 2023

Uterine sarcoma treatment » Treatment

Sarcoma found during prior
hysterectomy

Treatment after surgery
Treatment after surgery depends on the tumor
type.

If the cancer was found after a partial or
total hysterectomy, treatment will depend on
the results of the original hysterectomy and
whether the ovaries and fallopian tubes were
removed.

Low-grade ESS or low-risk adenosarcoma
If you still have your ovaries and fallopian
tubes, surgery to remove them (a BSO) is
recommended for stage I tumors. If you’ve
already had a BSO, or if you are menopausal,
observation (no treatment) is recommended.

If the tumor was not removed in one piece or
if the cervix was not removed, you may have
another surgery to remove the cancer and the
remaining cervix.

A BSO is also recommended for stage II,
III, IVA, and IVB low-grade ESS tumors
and low-risk adenosarcomas. In addition to
surgery, one or both of the following treatments
may be given:

If your ovaries and fallopian tubes were not
removed during surgery, they may be removed
now. If only one ovary and its fallopian tube
were initially removed, the remaining ovary
and fallopian tube may be removed. This may
be the best choice for low-grade ESS tumors,
adenosarcomas, and estrogen receptorpositive tumors.



Anti-estrogen hormone therapy



External radiation therapy

Aromatase inhibitors are the preferred antiestrogen therapy for low-grade ESS and lowrisk adenosarcomas. All of the recommended
options for anti-estrogen therapy are listed in
Guide 4.
If radiation therapy is used for stage IVB
cancer, it is considered palliative. This means
the goal is not to treat the cancer, but to control
or prevent symptoms caused by the tumor.

Other tumor types
The information that follows applies to the
following tumor types:

High-risk adenosarcoma
If you still have your ovaries and fallopian
tubes, surgery to remove them (a BSO)
is recommended for stage I high-risk
adenosarcomas. If you’ve already had a BSO,
or if you are menopausal, observation (no
treatment) is recommended.
A BSO is also recommended for stage II, III,
IVA, and IVB high-risk adenosarcomas. Your
doctor will consider treatment with systemic
therapy after surgery. Either a chemotherapy
or a targeted therapy drug is often given. Or, if
the cancer is hormone receptor-positive, your
doctor may recommend anti-estrogen therapy.



High-grade ESS



uLMS



UUS



Other sarcomas, such as PEComa



Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)

The recommended treatment after surgery for
these tumor types is presented according to
stage.
If the cancer is stage I, no further treatment
is needed after surgery. The cancer will be
observed. You can start surveillance and
follow-up care.

If systemic therapy is planned, palliative
external radiation therapy may also be added.

For stage II and III cancers, some people
have more treatment after surgery. Your doctor
will consider treatment with systemic therapy
and/or external radiation therapy. If the results
of surgery are very good, observation (no
treatment) may be an option.
If the cancer is stage IV, more treatment
is needed after surgery. Systemic therapy,
external radiation therapy, or both are
recommended for stage IVA disease. For stage
IVB, the main treatment is systemic therapy.
Palliative radiation therapy may be used to
prevent or control symptoms caused by the
cancer.
If systemic therapy is needed, either a
chemotherapy or a targeted therapy drug
is often given. Or, if the cancer is hormone
receptor-positive, your doctor may recommend
anti-estrogen therapy.

About systemic therapy after
surgery

If the cancer has certain biomarkers (features),
targeted therapy with a tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) may be a better choice than
chemotherapy. A small number of uterine
sarcomas have a biomarker (feature) called
NTRK gene fusion. TKI therapy will be
considered after surgery for these cancers.
It will also be considered for inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) with ALK
translocation.

The systemic therapy most often given after
surgery is chemotherapy. If treatment with
chemotherapy is planned, there are several
preferred regimens. Most include doxorubicin
(Adriamycin). Your doctor will consider several
factors when recommending a chemotherapy
regimen. See Guide 5.

Guide 5
First-line drug therapy for advanced, recurrent/metastatic, or inoperable uterine
sarcomas

Preferred regimens

• Doxorubicin
• Docetaxel + gemcitabine
• Doxorubicin + ifosfamide

In addition to surveillance testing, a range of
other care is important for cancer survivors.
This includes keeping alert for cancer
symptoms. See Part 6: Survivorship for more
information.

Surveillance begins when there are no signs
of cancer after treatment. It is used to find
early signs that cancer has returned. Physical
exams and imaging tests are used to monitor
for the return of uterine sarcomas. See

51

Uterine sarcoma treatment » Recurrence

Recurrence

No prior external radiation
If you have not had EBRT, options for treating
uterine sarcoma that returns to the pelvis
include surgery and EBRT.

The return of cancer after a cancer-free period
is known as a recurrence. If recurrence is
suspected, you will likely have imaging tests. If
there is suspicion that the cancer has spread
to areas far from the pelvis (metastasized),
imaging may include a PET/CT scan of your
neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.

If surgery is planned, you may have EBRT
with or without systemic therapy first to try
to shrink the tumor. If all of the cancer is not
removed during surgery, EBRT may be used
after surgery to treat residual areas of cancer.
It will not be used again, however, if it was
used before surgery. If used after surgery,
brachytherapy and/or systemic therapy may be
given in addition to EBRT.

Treating a recurrence depends in part on
the location of the new cancer growth. After
surgery to remove the uterus, ovaries, and
fallopian tubes, cancer may return to the
vagina, to areas near the vagina, or to areas
far from the pelvis.

If treatment with EBRT is planned instead of
surgery, brachytherapy and/or systemic therapy
may also be used. For low-grade ESS and
low-risk adenosarcoma, anti-estrogen hormone
therapy is preferred for systemic therapy.

Treatment of recurrent uterine sarcoma also
depends on whether you’ve had external beam
radiation therapy (EBRT). EBRT is generally
not used to treat the same area more than
once, so this is important when deciding how
to treat recurrent cancer.

Distant recurrence
If uterine sarcoma returns and spreads to other
areas of the body, such as the liver or lungs, it
is known as a distant recurrence. The cancer
is metastatic. The new cancer growths, or
tumors, are called metastases.

Cancer returned to the vagina or
pelvis
Prior external radiation
If you received prior treatment with EBRT,
one of the following approaches may be used
to treat cancer that returns to the vagina or
pelvis:


Surgery, with or without systemic therapy



Systemic therapy





Biomarker testing
If biomarker testing has not yet been done,
it is recommended at this time. Biomarkers
are targetable features of a cancer. They
are often mutations (changes) in particular
genes. Testing for these mutations helps guide
treatment for recurrent, metastatic uterine
sarcoma. The results can also be used to
determine whether you meet the criteria for
joining certain clinical trials.

Careful re-treatment of selected areas
using EBRT
Brachytherapy, with or without EBRT of
selected areas

Testing for biomarkers involves analyzing
a piece of tumor tissue in a lab or testing a
sample of blood. Testing for the following
biomarkers is recommended:

If systemic therapy is planned (alone or in
addition to surgery), anti-estrogen hormone
therapy is preferred for low-grade ESS and
low-risk adenosarcoma.

IMT with ALK rearrangement

Widespread metastases
If there are many new areas of cancer
growth outside the pelvis, systemic therapy
is recommended. Chemotherapy is usually
given first for recurrent, metastatic disease.
There are several preferred first-line regimens.
Most include doxorubicin (Adriamycin). See
Guide 5.

An inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)
is a rare type of uterine sarcoma. Most IMTs
have a biomarker called ALK translocation or
rearrangement. Cancers with this biomarker
are referred to as ALK-positive or ALK+.

If the cancer has certain biomarkers, targeted
therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
may be a better choice than chemotherapy.
A small number of uterine sarcomas have
a biomarker called NTRK gene fusion. TKI
therapy will be considered for these cancers.
It will also be considered for IMTs with ALK
translocation.

Testing for biomarkers may be performed
individually, or as part of a larger panel
(group). Testing for many biomarkers at one
time is called next-generation sequencing
(NGS). NGS may find other gene mutations for
which targeted treatments may be available.

Palliative EBRT may be used in addition
to systemic therapy. The goal is to shrink
the tumor(s) in order to relieve or prevent
symptoms. An alternative to having any
treatment at this stage is to begin supportive
(also called palliative) care.

Minimal metastases
If there are only a few metastases, removing
or destroying them with surgery or ablative
therapies may be an option. Ablative therapies
include image-guided ablation and stereotactic
body radiation therapy (SBRT). Ablation
destroys cancer cells using heat, cold, or lightactivated drugs. SBRT is a highly specialized
type of external radiation requiring 5 or fewer
treatment sessions.

Because the cancer cannot be cured, the
goal of supportive care is to make you more
comfortable and to help keep the cancer under
control. Supportive care may also help you
live longer, improve your eating, and help you
feel better overall. When used for advanced
cancers, supportive care is often called
palliative care.

If surgery is possible, systemic therapy and/
or EBRT may be used after surgery to kill
any remaining cancer cells. If the metastases
cannot be surgically removed, treatment with
systemic therapy and/or local therapies is
recommended. Local therapies include EBRT
and ablation. If systemic therapy works well,
surgery may become an option.

Second-line and beyond systemic
therapy
If the cancer does not respond or stops
responding to first-line systemic therapy, there
are other options. Other first-line regimens in
Guide 5 can be tried. Otherwise, regimens
that can be tried next (second-line regimens)
are listed in Guide 7. If the tumor has certain
biomarkers, immunotherapy or targeted
therapy may be an option.

Uterine sarcoma treatment » Key points

Key points




Sarcoma found during prior hysterectomy

Uterine sarcomas are rare. They start in
the wall or muscles of the uterus.



Uterine sarcomas can spread quickly
and be hard to treat. They are often
found after a hysterectomy done for other
reasons or during surgery to remove
fibroids.



Testing






Imaging tests are needed before starting
treatment. A CT scan of your chest,
abdomen, and pelvis with contrast is
recommended. You may also have MRI of
your pelvis, abdomen, or both.





If these tests are unclear, a PET/CT
scan may be ordered. Other imaging is
individualized.



Hormone receptor testing will be
considered for ESS, uLMS, and
adenosarcomas. This helps decide
whether the ovaries should be removed
for those of childbearing age.



Physical exams are recommended every
3 to 4 months in the first 2 to 3 years
after treatment. After that, exams are
performed once or twice a year.
Imaging is recommended every 3 to
6 months for the first 3 years after
treatment. During years 4 and 5, imaging
is recommended every 6 to 12 months.
You may have imaging every 1 to 2
years for up to 5 more years. This is
individualized.

Recurrence

Total hysterectomy is recommended when
possible. The decision to do a BSO is
individualized for those of reproductive
age. BSO is often recommended if the
cancer is hormone receptor-positive.





If you don’t want or can't have surgery,
treatment with systemic therapy,
external radiation therapy, or both is
recommended.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Uterine Cancer, 2023

If your ovaries and fallopian tubes were
not removed during hysterectomy,
they may be removed now. This may
be the best choice for low-grade ESS,
adenosarcoma, or estrogen receptorpositive tumors.

Surveillance

Sarcoma found by biopsy or fibroid
removal


If the tumor was not removed in one piece
or if the cervix was not removed, you
may have another surgery to remove the
cancer and the remaining cervix.

55

After a hysterectomy and BSO, cancer
may return to the vagina, to areas near
the vagina, or to areas far from the pelvis.
Treatment for recurrence depends on the
location of the new cancer growth and
whether you’ve had external radiation
therapy.

Staying alert for recurrence
or spread

Survivorship focuses on the
physical, emotional, and financial
issues unique to cancer survivors.

Your cancer treatment team and your PCP
will work together to make sure you get
recommended follow-up testing. But, you will
also have a job—paying close attention to your
body.

Managing the long-term side
effects of cancer and its treatment,
staying connected with your

Some kinds of cancer can return without giving
your body any hints. If uterine cancer does
come back, it often affects your body in ways
that you can feel or notice (symptoms). Your
doctor will teach you about the symptoms that
may mean uterine cancer has returned or
spread. They include:

primary care doctor, and living
a healthy lifestyle are important
parts of survivorship.

After finishing cancer treatment, your
primary care doctor, also known as a general
practitioner (GP) or primary care physician
(PCP), will play a key role in your care. Your
oncologist (cancer doctor) and PCP should
work together to make sure you get the followup care you need. To help do this, ask your
oncologist for a written survivorship care plan
that includes:

option for symptoms that mainly affect the
vagina, such as dryness. Discussion with a
menopausal symptom team is recommended
to determine whether this treatment is right for
you.

Some side effects of uterine cancer treatment
can start early and linger longer than
expected. Others may not appear until long
after treatment is over. Many uterine cancer
survivors experience changes in bowel,
urinary, and sexual function.

Bowel and bladder changes
After surgery or radiation therapy for uterine
cancer, it may be harder to hold urine in your
bladder. This is called urinary incontinence.
You may also experience urgency—a sudden
and strong need to urinate. Watery and/or
frequent bowel movements (diarrhea) are also
possible.

Premature menopause
If you have not entered menopause, surgery
that removes both ovaries (or whole pelvic
radiation therapy) will cause it. This is known
as surgical menopause. It is caused by the
sudden drop in estrogen in the body. This drop
can cause symptoms of menopause, including:


Hot flashes



Sleeping problems



Night sweats



Weight gain



Changes in mood



Pelvic floor physical therapy
The pelvic floor is a group of muscles that
supports the organs of the pelvis. These
muscles play a key role in bowel and bladder
control, as well as sexual function and arousal.
There are ways to strengthen these muscles
before and after treatment. This is known as
pelvic floor physical therapy, and there are
health care professionals who specialize in
it. Pelvic floor therapy can include at-home
exercises to tighten and release the vaginal
and anal muscles (Kegel exercises), as well as
hands-on techniques by a physical therapist.
Ask your treatment team for help finding a
pelvic floor specialist in your area.

Thinning, drying, and irritation of the
vaginal lining (vaginal atrophy)

When caused by surgery, the symptoms of
menopause may be sudden and more severe.
There are also long-term risks of not having
enough estrogen. They include heart or blood
vessel problems (cardiovascular disease) and
bone loss (osteoporosis).

Sexual and vaginal wellness
You may have sexual side effects after uterine
cancer treatment, including:

Hormone replacement therapy
If you have symptoms of surgical menopause,
your doctor may suggest hormone
replacement therapy (HRT). One option is
systemic HRT. Estrogen is given as a pill
taken by mouth or a patch placed on the skin.
Another option for HRT is vaginal estrogen
cream or tablets. This type may be the best

Survivorship » Early, late, and long-term effects

help minimize the impact of cancer treatment
on your sexual health.

Vaginal moisturizers
Older age, menopause, and some uterine
cancer treatments can cause the vagina
to become dry and less stretchy. To offset
this side effect, use of water-based vaginal
moisturizers is encouraged. Vaginal
moisturizers restore moisture to the vagina
and help to keep the vaginal tissue healthy.
They can be used daily, and many come with
applicators to make using them easier.

Other physical side effects
In addition to effects on bowel, bladder, and
sexual function, more general effects such
as fatigue, trouble breathing, and difficulty
sleeping are common.
Radiation treatment to the pelvis can weaken
bones in the pelvis. This puts you at increased
risk of fractures. Your doctor may start
monitoring the density of your bones.

Vaginal dilator therapy
Radiation therapy to the pelvic area can
cause the vagina to become shorter and
narrower. This is called vaginal stenosis.
Vaginal stenosis can make it uncomfortable or
even painful to have sex, or to have vaginal
examinations by a doctor. Vaginal dilator
therapy may help. A vaginal dilator is a device
used to gradually stretch or widen the vagina.
You can start using a dilator as soon as 2 to
4 weeks after radiation therapy has ended
and can continue to use it for as long as you
want. Vaginal dilators are not one-size-fits-all.
Different sizes are available, as are dilator kits
containing different size devices. The size of
the dilator can be increased over time as the
vagina lengthens and widens.

Chemotherapy can damage the sensory
nerves. This is known as neuropathy. The
damage can result in pain, numbness, tingling,
swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts
of the body. It often begins in the hands or feet
and gets worse over time. Neuropathic pain is
often described as a shooting or burning pain.
Treatment for uterine cancer often involves
removing lymph nodes during surgery. Lymph
may not drain properly after lymph nodes are
removed. This can result in lymphedema.
Lymphedema is swelling caused by a build-up
of lymph fluid in tissues. It most often occurs in
the lower body for uterine cancer survivors.

Sexual health therapists
While it may be uncomfortable to talk about
sexual health, keep in mind that these
side effects are common and can often be
managed or lessened. Consider seeing a
sexual health therapist. These health care
professionals specialize in helping cancer
survivors and others overcome and manage
sexual side effects of cancer treatment. Many
cancer treatment centers have programs
focused solely on sexual health after cancer
treatment. Ask your doctor about resources
available through your cancer center that can

Uterine Cancer, 2023

Ask your treatment team for a complete list of
possible late and long-term side effects.

Mental health
The effects of uterine cancer and its treatment
can be difficult to cope with. Many survivors
report having an overall lower quality of life
after cancer treatment. Depression, anxiety,
fear of recurrence, and trouble adjusting
to changes in the body are possible. Many
people also have financial stressors, such as
concerns or hesitation about returning to work
and insurance coverage issues. Personal

relationships, sexuality, and intimacy may also
be affected by a cancer diagnosis or cancer
treatment.

Monitoring for the return of uterine cancer is
important after finishing treatment. But it is also
important to keep up with other aspects of your
health. Steps you can take to help prevent
other health issues and to improve your quality
of life are described next.

If you are anxious, distressed, depressed, or
are just having trouble coping with life after
cancer, you are not alone. Tell your treatment
team about these symptoms. Expect your
treatment team to ask about your mental
health. If they don’t, speak up. There are many
resources available that can improve mental
health and wellness for cancer survivors.
Social workers at your treatment center are
often excellent resources to help connect you
with mental health and financial resources.

Cancer screening
Get screened for other types of cancer,
such as breast, skin, and colorectal cancer.
Your primary care doctor can tell you the
recommended screening tests based on your
age and risk level. If your cervix and/or ovaries
were not removed as part of treatment, ask
your doctor about screening for these cancer
types.

For more information, see the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Distress During
Cancer Care at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the app NCCN Patient Guides for
Cancer

Other health care
Get other recommended health care for
your age such as blood pressure screening,
hepatitis C screening, and immunizations
(such as the flu shot).

Diet and exercise
Leading a healthy lifestyle includes maintaining
a healthy body weight. Try to exercise at a
moderate intensity for at least 150 minutes per
week. All patients should have a discussion
with their doctor before starting a new exercise
regimen.
Eat a healthy diet with lots of plant-based
foods. Alcohol may increase the risk of certain
cancers. Drink little to no alcohol.

Quit smoking
If you are a smoker, quit! Your doctor can
provide (or refer you for) counseling on how to
stop smoking.
