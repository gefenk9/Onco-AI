About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolic Disease,
Version 2.2023 — June 1, 2023.

Both thrombi and emboli can be dangerous.
A thrombus may grow large enough to block

concerned about them.

What is a blood clot?

Dangerous blood clots are common in people
with cancer. They can cause lifelong health
problems. They are also a leading cause of
death. Lives may be saved if cancer-related
blood clots are better understood, prevented,
and treated.

A blood clot is a gel-like clump of blood. It
is made of cells called platelets that stick to
body tissue and to each other. The clot is
strengthened by a fibrin mesh that holds the
sticky platelets together and traps red blood
cells.
Normally, blood clots develop to stop bleeding
and then dissolve. This is a healthy, protective

A blood clot is a thickened
clump of blood. It is made of
platelets, red blood cells, and

Why do many people with
cancer get blood clots?

Cancers with an increased
risk for blood clots

People with cancer usually have multiple
risk factors for blood clots. A risk factor is
something that increases your chance of
developing a disease. People with cancer have
the same risk factors for blood clots as people
without cancer. They also have risk factors
related to cancer.
Cancer itself is a risk factor for blood clots.
People with cancer at greatest risk for blood
clots have:






A type of cancer that is linked with sticky
blood or slow blood flow
A cancer that’s active and not in remission
or cured
A cancer that has grown or spread to
other parts of the body

Many types of cancer treatment also increase
the risk for blood clots. Treatment-related risk
factors for clots are:





Major surgery
Whole-body drug treatment, called
systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy,
kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy,
selective estrogen receptor modulators,
and immunomodulating agents
An implanted device called a central
venous access device (also called CVAD
or central venous catheter)

Some risk factors for blood clots are made
worse by cancer. Infections are a risk factor,
and having cancer makes you more likely
to get infections. A long period of physical
inactivity increases the risk for blood clots.
Cancer may make you less active because
you feel tired, need bed rest, or are bedridden.

What’s the best treatment
for blood clots?

Key points


There’s no treatment for blood clots that’s
best for everyone with cancer. The best
treatment is the treatment that’s right for you.
Importantly, your health care should follow
best practices. Best practices are based on
the latest research and practices at top cancer
centers. This book is about the best practices
for cancer-related blood clots.





Anticoagulants are anti-clot drugs. They are
central to preventing and treating blood clots.
Anticoagulants are often called blood thinners,
but they do not thin blood. They slow down the
body’s ability to form a blood clot.

Cancer and its treatment increase the risk
of clots. They slow down blood flow or
make blood sticky.
Anticoagulants are drugs that prevent and
treat blood clots.

“

Not all people with cancer should be on
anticoagulants to prevent blood clots.
Preventive care is started when there’s an
increased risk of clots. Read Chapter 3 to learn
who’s at risk and the options for preventive
care.

Your medical team is your
greatest asset and friend(s),
especially the nurses. They are
all highly skilled and sincerely
dedicated to help you however
they can."

If a clot develops, treatment will be tailored to
you. Read Chapter 4 to learn the treatment
options for the type of blood clot you have.
Some clots are treated right away while others
are watched to see if they grow.
Anticoagulants are safe for many people with
cancer but have risks. If you start bleeding,
your body may have trouble stopping the
bleeding. Read Chapter 5 to learn when
to contact your care team. Chapter 5 also
discusses when you might need a change in
treatment.

Spotting blood clots » Dangerous blood clots

This chapter describes different

Venous thromboembolism

types of blood clots. Learn which

Venous thromboembolism is blood flow
blocked by blood clots that started in veins.
It is more common than other types of
blockages, and there’s more research on
how to manage it. Common types of venous
thromboembolism are:

blood clots you may be at risk for.
Also, learn their symptoms, so
you can spot a blood clot early
when treatment works best.





Dangerous blood clots



A thrombus is an abnormal blood clot inside
of a blood vessel. It can develop in either an
artery or vein. Arteries transport oxygen-rich
blood away from the heart to the whole body.
Veins transport blood that lacks oxygen back
to the heart. Blood clots in veins have different
causes and are treated differently than clots in
arteries.



Deep vein thrombosis is caused by a
blood clot in a vein far beneath the skin.
Superficial vein thrombosis is caused
by a blood clot in a vein near the skin.
Splanchnic vein thrombosis is
caused by a blood clot in certain veins of
the digestive system.
Pulmonary embolism is a blood clot
that broke free and got stuck in an artery
within a lung.

The types of venous thromboembolism
can have vastly different symptoms and
prognoses. A prognosis is the likely course and

Embolus
Deep veins of the leg

Deep vein thrombosis
Deep vein thrombosis is the
most common type of blood
clot. If not treated, the clot
could break free and get stuck
in an artery within a lung.
This is called a pulmonary
embolism. Pulmonary
embolisms can be deadly.

You may have swelling near your collarbone or
in your neck. The catheter may not be working
like it should when there’s a blood clot.

outcome of a disease. In the next sections,
the risk factors and symptoms of each clot are
explained.

Deep vein thrombosis

Deep vein thrombosis is serious. Contact your
care team right away if you have any of the
symptoms.

Deep vein thrombosis can occur in any deep
vein but often occurs in the large veins of
the legs. It commonly occurs in people with
cancer, especially those getting chemotherapy.
Treatment received through a catheter in a
central vein increases the risk for deep vein
thrombosis. This type of catheter is called a
central venous access device (also called
CVAD or central venous catheter).

Superficial vein thrombosis
Superficial vein thrombosis is common in
people with cancer but is less likely to be
dangerous than other clots. Even so, contact
your care team if you have symptoms.
Superficial vein thrombosis can grow and
involve deep veins.

A symptom of deep vein thrombosis is ongoing
cramps in your calf. Cramping may feel like a
charley horse. Another symptom of deep vein
thrombosis is swelling in one arm or one leg.
Your limb may feel heavy or painful. Instead
of a limb, you may have swelling in the face,
neck, or the collarbone area if the clot is in
these areas.

Also called superficial thrombophlebitis,
superficial vein thrombosis may be caused by
injections into veins, such as chemotherapy
infusion. Other risk factors are surgery,
prolonged physical inactivity, and taking
estrogen. Having other types of clots increases

Symptoms of clots in limbs
Deep and superficial vein
thrombosis most often occur
in one leg or one arm. The
limb may swell, turn red, or
ache. For some people, these
changes occur in one spot, but
for others, the entire limb is
affected.

the risk for clots in superficial veins. Superficial
vein thrombosis can occur at the same time as
deep vein thrombosis.



Superficial vein thrombosis causes symptoms
more often than other clots. It often occurs
in a leg, but you may see symptoms in other
places. Your skin that’s over the clot may be
red, warm, and swollen. The area may be very
tender to the touch. The vein might feel hard.



There are several types of splanchnic vein
thrombosis. Each one is named after the vein
with the blood clot. These veins are in the
abdomen, which is below the chest:



There are several diseases linked with
splanchnic vein thrombosis. Inflammation
of the pancreas and chronic liver disease
increase the risk for this clot, and so does
a tumor in the abdomen. Your risk for an
abdominal clot is high if you have one of
these blood diseases—paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria or myeloproliferative
neoplasm.

Hepatic vein thrombosis occurs in
veins that carry blood from the liver to the
heart.
Portal vein thrombosis occurs in the
vein that carries blood to the liver.

Symptoms of clots in the
abdomen
Splanchnic vein thrombosis is
caused by clots in digestive veins
in the abdomen. The abdomen
contains many organs including
the stomach. Abdominal clots
can cause sudden pain, a swollen
belly, and nausea and vomiting.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Blood Clots and Cancer, 2023

Splenic vein thrombosis occurs in the
vein that carries blood from the spleen to
the portal vein.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis is not as common
as other types of blood clots. But be aware
that the risk is higher in certain situations.
The chance of splanchnic vein thrombosis
developing is higher after surgery in the
abdomen. There’s also an increased risk
during estrogen treatment.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis



Mesenteric vein thrombosis
occurs in veins that carry blood from the
intestines to the portal vein.

11

Spotting blood clots » Pulmonary embolism » Key points

A common symptom of splanchnic vein
thrombosis is sudden abdominal pain. The
area may feel tender when touched, and
your belly may stick out more than normal. If
someone tries to touch your abdomen, you
may quickly—like a reflex—guard the area.

The 3 S’s of pulmonary
embolism symptoms

3 Sudden shortness of breath
3 Sharp chest pain
3 Short fainting spells

Other symptoms of splanchnic vein thrombosis
make you feel like you have a stomach bug.
You may feel like you’re going to throw up. You
may vomit or have diarrhea. Some people lose
their appetite or have pain when eating. Some
people have a fever.

Key points

Pulmonary embolism



If you have symptoms of a pulmonary
embolism, call 911. It is very serious.
Be on the lookout for symptoms if you had a
blood clot recently. Pulmonary embolism often
starts from deep vein thrombosis in a leg but
can start from other types of clots, too.



Common symptoms of a pulmonary embolism
are shortness of breath, chest pain, and
fainting. Other symptoms include rapid
breathing, fast heartbeat, and a new cough
that may have bloody mucus. You may feel
uneasy or anxious.

It’s important for people with cancer to
spot a blood clot early. Prompt treatment
may prevent lifelong health problems or
save your life.
Deep vein thrombosis occurs in veins far
beneath the skin. It may cause a part of
your body to swell. Often, one leg or one
arm is swollen. Clots in a leg may feel like

care is recommended.

Indirect factor Xa inhibitors
Fondaparinux (Arixtra) was made in a lab and
is similar to a fragment of heparin. It indirectly
stops Factor Xa by activating antithrombin. It
has no direct effect on thrombin.

Types of preventive care
Preventive care is medicine that is used to
prevent the start of a health problem. You may
hear it called prophylaxis (sounds like proh-fuhlak-sis). Preventive care for blood clots is called
thromboprophylaxis (throm-bo-proh-fuh-laksis).

Direct factor Xa inhibitors
Direct factor Xa inhibitors attach to and directly
block Factor Xa. They include apixaban
(Eliquis) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto).

There are several types of preventive care for
blood clots. There are prescription drugs that
help prevent blood clots. But there is a device
and a sock-like product, too.

Intermittent pneumatic
compression device
One type of mechanical prevention is an
intermittent pneumatic compression device.
It has sleeves that wrap around the legs
and squeezes them at times. The squeezing
pumps blood out of your legs just like your
muscles do when walking. This helps prevent
blood clots.

Anticoagulants
Anticoagulants are drugs that prevent blood
clots. They stop the making of the fibrin
mesh that holds the clot together. They work
by disabling blood proteins, called clotting
factors, that work together to form fibrin. See
Guide 1 for a list of anticoagulants used for
prevention.

Graduated compression
stockings

Heparin
Heparin is a substance made by your body
and by animals. When injected into the body,
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Unfractionated heparin stops two
clotting factors called Factor Xa and
thrombin.

Graduated compression stockings are another
type of mechanical prevention. They are like
a long sock but squeeze the legs to increase

Preventing blood clots » Planning safe care

A series of tests will be done to plan preventive
care. Since bleeding may occur while on
anticoagulation, your team will check for
factors that increase risk. These factors
include low platelet counts, bleeding disorders,
or current bleeding. Read Chapter 5 to learn
how to spot abnormal bleeding and how
anticoagulants are managed.

blood flow in veins. They give the strongest
squeeze at the ankle and the weakest squeeze
at the knee or thigh. The amount of pressure is
measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
Typically, stockings will have either 15 to 20
mm Hg or 20 to 30 mm Hg of pressure.

Planning safe care

Mechanical prevention may not be safe for
some people. It should not be used if you had
a recent blood clot in a deep vein and are not
on anticoagulation. The squeezing of the legs
could cause a piece of the clot to break off and
travel to your lungs. For some people, having

Your care team will assess which type of
preventive care is right for you. They will
consider how well each option works but also
the health problems each option could cause.
They will not prescribe preventive care that is
likely to cause serious harm.

Preventing blood clots » Prevention in the hospital

Medical history
Your care team will ask about your past and
current health and medications. If you took
anticoagulants before, your team will want to
know about any side effects. Also, be prepared
to discuss the health problems of your close
blood relatives.

a large bruise-like hematoma or an open skin
sore makes mechanical prevention unsafe.
Graduated compression stockings should also
not be used if blood flow in your arteries is very
slow. The stockings could make the problem
worse. Another possible reason not to use
compression stockings is if you have nerve
damage called peripheral neuropathy.

Physical exam
A member of your care team will perform a
thorough physical exam of your body. This
exam includes checking vital signs, such as
heart rate. Your provider will also look over
your body and gently press on areas.

Prevention in the hospital
Being in a hospital can increase the chance of
a blood clot. Less physical activity and certain
treatments raise the risk. NCCN experts
recommend preventive care for people with
cancer admitted to the hospital. The exception
is people with basal or squamous cell skin
cancer because their risk for blood clots is low.

Blood and urine tests
To plan preventive care, your team needs to
know your level of platelets, clotting ability, and
the health of your liver and kidneys.
Platelets in a blood sample are measured with
a lab test called a complete blood count. This
test also measures other parts of the blood
including white and red blood cells.

Tests to plan care
Your care team will plan safe preventive care
for you based on the tests described next.

Hospitalization and blood
clots
Prolonged periods of inactivity
increase the chance of a blood
clot. If you are bedridden in a
hospital, you should receive
preventive care for blood clots.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

an option for people who had laparoscopic
surgery for colorectal cancer.

To assess how well your blood is clotting,
coagulation tests on a blood sample will be
done. Prothrombin time and activated partial
thromboplastin time are two tests that measure
how long it takes for your blood to clot.

Some surgeries increase the risk of blood
clots more than others. Such surgeries
include those done in the abdomen or pelvis.
Before high-risk surgery, you may receive
unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight
heparin. Additionally, intermittent pneumatic
compression may be used.

How well your liver is working is assessed by a
group of blood tests called liver function tests.
Kidney function tests performed on blood
or urine samples reveal the health of your
kidneys.

If you had high-risk surgery for cancer, NCCN
experts recommend extended preventive care
after being discharged from the hospital. Read
the next section, Prevention at home, for more
information.

Risk assessment
Your care team will assess your chance of
getting a blood clot and make decisions based
on your level of risk. Your risk is increased
when you have cancer and are hospitalized.
Your overall health, age, and other factors may
further increase your risk.

For medical hospitalizations, blood clots are
prevented with unfractionated heparin, lowmolecular-weight heparin, or fondaparinux.
You’ll receive the anticoagulant during your
entire hospital stay or for up to 6 to 14 days.
The length of treatment depends on your clot
risk as assessed by your care team.

Care options
There are several good options for preventing
blood clots in the hospital. You may receive
anticoagulants, mechanical care, or both.

If receiving medical care, apixaban and
rivaroxaban are not started in the hospital.
But either medication may be continued if you
were taking it before being admitted. If you
have had a side effect called heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia, apixaban or rivaroxaban is
an option instead of heparin.

Anticoagulants
Preventive care with anticoagulants is based
on whether you are having surgery or other
medical care. It is a low dose of medication
compared to what is typically used for
treatment of blood clots.

Mechanical care
When anticoagulants are not an option,
mechanical care is used in the hospital.
One study found that intermittent pneumatic
compression prevented deep vein thrombosis
better than graduated compression stockings.
People using pneumatic compression also had
fewer skin problems. More research is needed
to confirm these results.

For surgical hospitalizations, unfractionated
heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and
fondaparinux are options for many people.
These anticoagulants are typically taken for at
least 7 to 10 days.
A direct factor Xa inhibitor is an additional
option for some people. Apixaban is an option
for people having surgery for gynecologic
cancer. These cancers include uterine,
cervical, and ovarian cancer. Rivaroxaban is

for 3 weeks after finishing a week of lowmolecular-weight heparin in the hospital.

Some people with cancer benefit from
preventive care of blood clots when at home.
NCCN experts have identified two groups at
risk for blood clots:




Care options during systemic
therapy
Systemic therapy is a whole-body treatment
with cancer drugs. It travels in your
bloodstream to treat cancer wherever it is in
your body. Chemotherapy, immunomodulatory
drugs, and endocrine therapy are types of
systemic therapy.

People discharged from the hospital after
a cancer surgery within the abdomen or
pelvis
People at risk for blood clots while
receiving systemic therapy

A medical oncologist is an expert in systemic
therapy. They will prescribe systemic therapy
as well as an anticoagulant if needed.

Anticoagulants are used to prevent blood clots
at home.

Care options after surgical
hospitalization

A member of your care team will assess
your level of risk for blood clots. There are
measures to assess a person’s risk of clots,
such as the Khorana score.

Blood clots are more likely to occur after
cancer surgeries done in the abdomen or
pelvis if any of the following describe you:







The Khorana score is not used to assess risk
for people with acute leukemia, brain tumors,
multiple myeloma, or a myeloproliferative
neoplasm. Information on preventing blood
clots among people with multiple myeloma or
a myeloproliferative neoplasm can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

You had high-risk surgery, which is a
surgery for a gastrointestinal cancer, such
as stomach, colon, or rectal cancer
You’ve had a blood clot before
You had general anesthesia for more than
2 hours
You were in the hospital bed for 4 or more
days



You have advanced stage cancer



You are over 60 years of age

If you’re at risk for blood clots, NCCN experts
recommend taking an anticoagulant after
being discharged from the hospital. Most likely,
your surgeon will be the one to prescribe an
anticoagulant before you leave the hospital.
You will need to take an anticoagulant every
day. Apixaban, dalteparin, and enoxaparin
are taken for 4 weeks. Rivaroxaban is taken

for a total score that ranges from 0 to 6. Two
points are scored for stomach and pancreatic
cancers. One point is scored for lung,
gynecologic, bladder, and testicular cancers as
well as lymphoma.



Routine preventive care for blood clots is not
needed when your score is either 0 or 1. Your
care team will check for blood clots at health
visits.



When Khorana scores are 2 and higher, NCCN
experts recommend that providers consider
prescribing an anticoagulant for 6 months or
longer if the risk persists. If prescribed, the
anticoagulant is taken every day. Your care
team will decide the best preventive care for
you based on your risk for clots versus your
risk for side effects.

Some people with cancer are more at
risk for blood clots than others. You have
an increased risk when hospitalized and
after a hospital stay for cancer surgery.
Certain people taking cancer drugs, called
systemic therapy, also have an increased
risk.
Planning preventive care requires your
care team to do a thorough evaluation.
They will recommend care that’s safe and
works for you.
Anticoagulants are used for preventive
care in the hospital if possible. Additional
care with intermittent pneumatic
compression may be received if you’re
having surgery in the abdomen or pelvis.
When anticoagulants are not an option,
intermittent pneumatic compression or
graduated compression stockings are
used in the hospital.
If you had a high-risk cancer surgery,
extended care with anticoagulants is
recommended after being discharged
from the hospital.
Your risk for blood clots while on systemic
therapy depends on the type of cancer
and other factors. If you’re at increased
risk, your care team will consider
prescribing an anticoagulant.

veins. These clots may travel to
and get stuck in a lung artery. This
chapter explains the treatments
for these types of clots.

Anticoagulants
Anticoagulants stop the making of the fibrin
mesh that holds the clot together. They work
by disabling blood proteins, called clotting
factors, that work together to form fibrin. See
Guide 2 for a list of anticoagulants used for
treatment.

Types of treatment
Anticoagulants are the centerpiece of
treatment for acute venous thromboembolism.
Venous thromboembolism is blocked blood
flow by a blood clot in any vein or in an artery
within a lung. It is acute when the onset of

inserted through a cut made in a blood
vessel. This approach is called surgical
or open thrombectomy. Catheter-directed
thrombectomy breaks up or suctions out
the clot with a device. This approach
has several names including mechanical
thrombectomy and percutaneous
thrombectomy.

In Guide 2, you’ll see anticoagulants that are
also listed in Chapter 3 for preventive care.
A higher dose is typically used for treatment.
These anticoagulants include:




Unfractionated heparin, dalteparin
(Fragmin), enoxaparin (Lovenox), and
fondaparinux (Arixtra) activate a natural
anticoagulant in your body called
antithrombin



Apixaban (Eliquis) and rivaroxaban
(Xarelto) directly block Factor Xa

You’ll also see some anticoagulants that are
only recommended for treatment:


Edoxaban (Savaysa) blocks Factor Xa



Dabigatran (Pradaxa) blocks thrombin



Treatment without
anticoagulation

Warfarin lowers the level of clotting
factors by depleting vitamin K

Anticoagulation may not be an option for
you. In this case, clots that don’t pose a great
danger will be monitored, and the safety of
anticoagulants will be reassessed.

Treatment used with
anticoagulation

Higher-risk clots may be managed with a
removeable filter placed in the inferior vena
cava (IVC) vein within your abdomen. IVC
filters catch clots moving in the bloodstream
before they reach the lungs.

Another type of treatment is sometimes used
with anticoagulation. Some clots don’t need
additional treatment, and in many cases,
more research or training on these other
treatments is needed. Recommended options
for each type of venous thromboembolism are
listed later in this chapter, but here are three
examples:




A shunt is a small medical tube that is used
to manage certain clots in the belly area.
Shunts redirect blood flow around a clot by
making a new connection between two blood
vessels. They can be placed in the body by a
catheter. This approach is called transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or TIPS.
Shunts can also be placed during surgery.

Medications called thrombolytics dissolve
blood clots. They can be slowly injected
into a vein and travel throughout the body
in the bloodstream. This approach is
called systemic thrombolysis. Catheterdirected thrombolytics are injected directly
into a clot.
A procedure called a thrombectomy
removes blood clots from the body. It
can be performed with a balloon catheter

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Blood Clots and Cancer, 2023

Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis
dissolves and removes clots. Through a
catheter, a small amount of a thrombolytic
is injected into the clot. Next, the clot
fragments are suctioned out from the
vein.

heart rate. Your provider will also look over
your body and gently press on areas.

It takes a team of experts to plan cancer care
and provide support. When you have a blood
clot, your team may include an expert in blood
diseases called a hematologist. Other experts
that treat blood clots include

Blood and urine tests
Platelets in a blood sample are measured
with a lab test called a complete blood count.
You’re at risk of bleeding if your platelet levels
are low. A complete blood count also measures
other parts of the blood including white and red
blood cells.

Surgeons, interventional radiologists
Cardiologists, pulmonologists, vascular
medicine specialists

To assess how well your blood is clotting,
coagulation tests on a blood sample will be
done. Prothrombin time and activated partial
thromboplastin time are two tests that measure
how long it takes for your blood to clot.

Internal medicine practitioners

Your care team will assess which treatment
of blood clots is right for you. They will
consider how well a treatment works but
also the health problems it could cause.
The main side effect of anticoagulants is
bleeding. Read Chapter 5 to learn how to spot
abnormal bleeding and how anticoagulants are
managed.

How well your liver is working is assessed by a
group of blood tests called liver function tests.
Kidney function tests performed on blood
or urine samples reveal the health of your
kidneys.

Tests are needed to plan your care. Examples
of information used for treatment planning are
the number of blood platelets and the health
of your liver and kidney. Common tests for
treating thrombosis are described next.

Imaging
Imaging takes pictures of the inside of your
body and is used to find diseases. Your care
team will use imaging to diagnose a blood clot.
Imaging is also used for treatment planning
because it shows where the clot is and the size
of the clot.

Medical history
Your care team will want to know all about
your health. Be prepared to tell them about
your past and current health and medications.
If you took anticoagulants before, your team
will want to know about any side effects. Also,
be prepared to discuss the health problems of
your close blood relatives.

In general, one of two types of imaging is
used to see clots. Venous ultrasound uses
soundwaves to make images of superficial or
deep veins. Computed tomography—often
called a CT scan—is used to see clots. It
combines many x-rays to make a detailed
image. If it’s safe for you, a swallowed or
injected contrast should be used to make the
images clearer.

Physical exam
A member of your care team will perform a
thorough physical exam of your body. This
exam includes checking vital signs, such as

Treating blood clots » Superficial vein thrombosis

Superficial vein thrombosis

Anticoagulation is not used at first for
superficial arm clots. The goal is to relieve
symptoms until the clot naturally dissolves.
Symptoms can be reduced with warm
compresses, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), and elevating the limb.

Superficial vein thrombosis occurs in veins
close to the skin. Often, treatment is not
needed because the clot dissolves on its own.
But some clots continue to grow. Your care
team will monitor the growth of the clot.

Your care team will keep watch for signs that
the blood clot is growing. If the clot gets bigger,
they will consider prescribing a low-dose
anticoagulant. Some people get a higher dose
to stop the clot from reaching deep veins.

Arm clots

Leg clots

Superficial vein thrombosis may be caused
by a catheter in your arm. In this case, the
catheter will be removed if it’s no longer
needed. On the other hand, the catheter may
remain in place if symptoms quickly resolve or
anticoagulation is started.

Superficial vein thrombosis in the leg is treated
with an anticoagulant. Low-dose treatment is
used for clots longer than 5 centimeters or that
extend above the knee. It is taken every day
for at least 6 weeks. A high dose will be used if
the clot is very close to a deep vein at the top
of the thigh. A high dose is taken every day for
at least 3 months.

A radiologist is a doctor who’s an expert in
reading images. This doctor will convey the
imaging results to your care team.

Imaging
Imaging makes pictures of
the insides of the body. It is
needed to diagnose blood
clots. Ultrasound is often
used to find blood clots in
limbs (shown).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Blood Clots and Cancer, 2023

24

Treating blood clots » Deep vein thrombosis

Deep vein thrombosis may be related to a
central venous access device. Treatment with
anticoagulation should continue for 3 months
or until the catheter is removed. The catheter
will be removed if symptoms persist or it gets
infected, damaged, or is no longer needed.

Instead of starting treatment, leg clots that
are unlikely to reach a deep vein may be
checked again. A second ultrasound will be
done in 7 to 10 days to assess the size of the
clot. If it’s larger, your team may prescribe an
anticoagulant.

If anticoagulation wasn’t safe at first, your
team will keep checking if it is an option now.
Clots in the abdomen, pelvis, or upper leg are
managed with an IVC filter until they can be
safely treated with anticoagulants. Once you’re
on an anticoagulant, the filter will be removed.

Deep vein thrombosis
Deep vein thrombosis occurs in veins far under
the skin. Thrombosis in these veins is treated
with an anticoagulant when possible.

Untreated clots below the knee are watched
using repeated ultrasound. If they grow into
the upper leg, treatment consists of either
anticoagulation or IVC filter.

Severe clots above the knee may need
quicker treatment than anticoagulation. Severe
clots may cause major symptoms, lead to
limb amputation, or be life-threatening. Your
team will consider additional treatment with
either pharmacomechanical thrombolysis or
mechanical thrombectomy.

Superficial vein
thrombosis
Superficial vein thrombosis
in an arm may resolve on
its own. Symptoms may be
relieved by elevating the arm

ibuprofen.

lung support from a medical device. If your
risk for bleeding is low, the clot may be treated
with either systemic or catheter-directed
thrombolysis. A second option is to remove the
clot with a surgical or catheter embolectomy.

A pulmonary embolism is caused by a blood
clot that traveled in the bloodstream to an
artery in a lung and got stuck. These clots
usually start in a deep vein within a leg or arm.
A pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening
condition at times, but many people survive if
promptly treated.

If anticoagulation wasn’t safe at first, your team
will keep checking if it is an option now. Clots
may be managed with an IVC filter until they
can be safely treated with anticoagulants.

Testing

Splanchnic vein thrombosis

Common tests of blood clots will be done, but
these dangerous lung clots also require special
testing. A scan called CT angiography is most
often used to see lung clots. Your team will
also check your lungs with a chest x-ray.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis is caused by a
blood clot in veins of the digestive system.
Clots in these veins cause symptoms common
to many diseases, so more tests may be
needed. Your care team will plan testing based
on your medical history and physical exam.

A lung clot can damage the heart. Your heart
function will be assessed with blood tests
called troponin and NT-proBNP. You will also
have an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) to
check for an abnormal heartbeat. You may
also have an ultrasound of the heart done to
check your heart function. This test is called an
echocardiogram.

A diagnosis of splanchnic vein thrombosis is
made with imaging. Treatment is based on
which vein the clot is in. It is also based on
how long you’ve had signs and symptoms of a
clot.


Treatment
If possible, a pulmonary embolism will be
treated with an anticoagulant. If you were
already on an anticoagulant, the dose may be
increased, or a different anticoagulant will be
started. After the acute period, you will stay
on an anticoagulant. You might return home
from the hospital if you’re out of danger. If
the embolism worsens, it may be treated with
thrombolysis or thrombectomy.



Chronic thrombosis started more than 8
weeks ago

Hepatic vein thrombosis
Hepatic vein thrombosis occurs in veins that
carry blood from the liver to the heart. A liver
specialist should evaluate anyone with this
type of thrombosis. They will review your
health records and meet with you.

An acute massive pulmonary embolism is
severe. It causes the blood pressure to drop
and could lead to heart and lung failure. Your
care team will consider more treatment in
addition to anticoagulation. Before starting
anticoagulation, you may receive heart and

a shunt. A shunt is also an option for acute
thrombosis not treated with anticoagulation.



If you have chronic hepatic vein thrombosis,
your care team will decide if an anticoagulant
would be helpful. A shunt is also an option.



Portal, mesenteric, splenic vein
thrombosis
Blood from the digestive system travels
through the mesenteric, splenic, and
portal veins on its way to the liver. Acute
thrombosis in these veins is treated the same
as acute hepatic vein thrombosis. Surgery
may be needed if the thrombosis caused
death of intestinal tissue. You’ll meet with a
gastroenterologist or surgeon for evaluation.





A gastroenterologist should evaluate anyone
with chronic thrombosis. Your care team will
decide if an anticoagulant would be helpful. A
shunt is another option.
Bleeding is not uncommon when chronic
thrombosis is diagnosed. A medication called
a beta blocker may be used to reduce the
chances of bleeding. Bleeding can also be
stopped with a band placed around a blood
vessel or with injected medication that scars
the vessel.

Your care team will do a thorough
evaluation to plan safe treatment for you.
Acute thrombosis in people with
cancer is treated with anticoagulation
when possible. A possible exception is
superficial vein thrombosis in an arm
because it may resolve on its own.
Anticoagulants are taken as long as there
is a risk for blood clots.
Highly dangerous clots may be quickly
dissolved with medication or removed.
These clots are also treated with
anticoagulation.
When anticoagulation is not safe, your
care team will monitor the growth of
clots. They will also reassess the safety
of anticoagulation in case it becomes
an option. Life-threating events may be
prevented with clot-catching filters or a
shunt that redirects blood flow.

Side effects

Anticoagulants have notable
benefits but also pose challenges.

Anticoagulants may cause health problems
called side effects. Some side effects are
unpleasant but bearable. Other side effects
may be severe and even life-threatening. Side
effects differ among people based on the type
of care as well as the person.

This chapter will help prepare you
for the road ahead.

Bleeding

Follow-up care

The main side effect of anticoagulants is
bleeding. Bleeding can be life-threatening,
so be on the lookout for it. Signs of abnormal
bleeding include:

Anticoagulants often work very well in
preventing and treating blood clots. For them
to work well, you must follow your prescription.
Do not stop or skip care. If you’re in the
hospital, your team will help you stay on track.



If you’re taking anticoagulants at home, you’ll
have regular visits with your care team. Blood
tests will also be done on a regular basis.
Between visits, contact your team if:

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare
side effect of heparin. Instead of preventing
blood clots, heparin may cause your body to
make more clots. If you’ve had this dangerous
side effect before, heparin will likely not be
prescribed for you again.

Managing anticoagulants » Changes in treatment

Changes in treatment
Some people may need a change to their
anticoagulant. Here are three reasons for a
change.

Anticoagulants do not
cause bleeding.
They make it harder for your
body to stop bleeding after
bleeding starts.

Bleeding
During follow-up care, your care team will
monitor your chance of bleeding. Your bleeding
risk increases if your platelet count drops to a
low level. If abnormal bleeding starts, options
include:









Staying on anticoagulation and receiving
transfusions of platelets

heart surgery and brain surgery. Very-low-risk
procedures include injections, cavity fillings,
and skin biopsies.

Stopping anticoagulation and having an
inferior vena cava (IVC) filter until your
platelet count increases

If you need a change in treatment, options
include:

Taking a lower dose of anticoagulant
Removing a central venous catheter if it’s
causing blood clots in deep veins



Stopping anticoagulation and monitoring
blood clots in lower legs with repeated
ultrasound




Some people experience life-threatening
bleeding. In this case, the effect of the
anticoagulant must be reversed quickly.
Medications that reverse effects are referred
to as antidotes. Not all anticoagulants have
antidotes.



Pausing anticoagulation
Temporarily switching to a short-acting
anticoagulant, which is called bridging
Placement of an IVC filter before briefly
stopping anticoagulation

New or worsening blood clots
Despite being on anticoagulation, the blood
clot may grow, or a new clot may form. Be
on the lookout for new clots, so changes
in treatment may be promptly made. See
Chapter 2 for a list of symptoms caused by
clots.

Medical procedure
People with cancer often undergo invasive
medical procedures like surgery. If you need
such a procedure, your care team will decide if
a change in your treatment is needed.

If you were on a low dose of anticoagulation,
the dose may be increased, or a different
anticoagulant will be started.

Your team will assess the bleeding risk of the
procedure plus your risk for dangerous blood
clots. Examples of high-risk procedures are

emergency surgery

If you were taking a high dose, your team
will consider new causes of blood clots.

Managing anticoagulants » Key points

You may have developed heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia. A tumor may be squeezing
a blood vessel, and so a clot formed. An IVC
filter may have narrowed a vessel causing a
clot to form.
New or worsening clots may be treated with an
even higher dose of anticoagulation. Another
option is to try a different anticoagulant.

If bleeding starts, you may get platelet
transfusions. If you have a central
venous catheter, it may be removed. Your
anticoagulation regimen may be altered.
If you have severe bleeding or need
emergency surgery, you may receive a
fast-acting antidote for anticoagulation.

I told my care team right away
when I noticed a side effect. This
really helped. They were very
good at treating it!"

If you need to schedule a procedure that’s
likely to cause bleeding, anticoagulation
may be paused, and you may get an
IVC filter. Another option is to switch to
bridging anticoagulation, which is a shortacting dose, until you can safely resume
your normal regimen.
If a blood clot worsens or a new clot
forms, the dose of your anticoagulant may
be increased or a new anticoagulant may
be started.
