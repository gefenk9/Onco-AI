Peripheral T-cell lymphoma basics

What is peripheral T-cell lymphoma?

This chapter gives a short overview of
peripheral T-cell lymphoma. You’ll learn
what it is, how it develops, what tests
can diagnose it, and what can be done
to treat it.

Peripheral T-cell
lymphoma is rare
and can be difficult to
diagnose and treat.
Seek out a medical
center that specializes
in the diagnosis
and treatment of
lymphomas.

What is peripheral T-cell
lymphoma?
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a rare cancer
that’s not easy to understand at first. It doesn’t
attack a single organ, such as in lung cancer
or stomach cancer. Unlike those cancers, a
lymphoma develops from certain blood cells
and can grow anywhere in the body.



So what is it exactly?
Let’s break it down word by word, from the last
word to the first:




Lymphoma – A lymphoma is a cancer
in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic
system is part of the immune system—
the body’s germ-fighting network. The
lymphatic system includes the lymph
nodes, spleen, gastrointestinal tract,
and skin. A lymphoma is a type of blood
cancer that develops when the lymphatic
system’s infection-fighting white blood
cells (lymphocytes) grow out of control.

Now, let’s put it all together:
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a cancer
that develops from infection-fighting cells
found throughout the body in the lymphatic
system.
There’s a lot more to know about this cancer,
though. Importantly, it’s not just a single type
of lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma
actually represents a group of many different
types of lymphomas. Also important:
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas usually grow
quickly.

T cell – T cells are lymphocytes that
defend against infections that invade your
body. In rare cases, though, something
goes wrong with the T cells—they change
from infection-fighting cells to rapidly
multiplying cancer cells.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, 2022

Peripheral – For T-cell lymphoma,
peripheral means a cancer that can
develop almost anywhere in the body. (So
it’s unlike a cancer that occurs in a single
organ or area, such as the lung or the
breast.) Lymphoma can develop almost
anywhere in the body because it starts in
the lymphatic system, and the lymphatic
system exists throughout the body.

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma basics

Can peripheral T-cell lymphoma be cured?

We’ll explain more about the different types
of peripheral T-cell lymphomas in Chapter 2.

What is cancer?
Cancer is a disease where cells—the building
blocks of the body—grow out of control. This
can end up harming the body. There are
many types of cells in the body, so there are
many types of cancers.

Can peripheral T-cell
lymphoma be cured?
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas can be treated
and sometimes they can be cured. After
treatment, many people have no signs or
symptoms of cancer (remission). For most
patients, though, the cancer eventually
comes back (relapses) at some point
after treatment. A relapse usually requires
additional treatment.

Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells.
Normal cells have certain rules. Cancer cells
don’t follow these rules.
• Cancer cells develop genetic errors
(mutations) that allow them to multiply
and make many more cancer cells. The
cancer cells crowd out and overpower
normal cells. Cancer cells take away
energy and nutrients that normal cells
need.

In the past, the outlook for people with
peripheral T-cell lymphoma wasn’t
good. Even today, the outlook may be
discouraging. Most people diagnosed with
peripheral T-cell lymphoma will have a
difficult road ahead.

• Normal cells live for a while and then die.
Cancer cells avoid normal cell death. They
survive much longer than normal cells do.

But even so, there’s hope. Things are
changing. New medicines are showing
greater effectiveness in treating certain
subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
Also, other promising treatments that are
specifically designed to treat peripheral
T-cell lymphoma are currently being studied
in clinical trials. The number of these trials
has increased in recent years, offering more
hope for patients.

• Cancer cells can spread to other areas of
the body. They can replace many normal
cells and cause organs to stop working
well.
• Treatment may get rid of cancer at first
but sometimes the cancer comes back
later.
• Cancer can stop responding to treatment
that worked before.
Scientists have learned a great deal about
cancer. As a result, today’s treatments work
better than treatments in the past. Also, many
people with cancer have more treatment
choices now than before.

What causes peripheral T-cell lymphoma?

What causes peripheral T-cell
lymphoma?

Typical symptoms of peripheral T-cell
lymphoma include:

Researchers aren’t exactly sure what causes
peripheral T-cell lymphoma. What they do
know is that these lymphomas start with
an abnormality (mutation) in some T-cell
lymphocytes. This mutation causes these
abnormal T cells to multiply quickly. Before
long, the abnormal cells grow out of control.
(Cancer is defined by abnormal cells growing
out of control.)

Fatigue



Fever



Night sweats



Rash



Unexplained weight loss

Let your doctor know about any symptoms you
have. Your symptoms may be the first step
toward a diagnosis. A diagnosis involves using
tests to identify an illness.

The mutation also keeps the abnormal T
cells alive much longer than they should live.
Eventually, all of these abnormal lymphocytes
fill up parts of the lymphatic system. This
can cause swelling in the lymph nodes,
spleen, liver, or other organs in the body.
These problems are also what cause cancer
symptoms.

Diagnosing peripheral T-cell lymphoma can
be a long and worrisome experience. Many
types of lymphoma have similar symptoms. So
several tests are required to determine exactly
which type of lymphoma you have.
It’s important to find the correct diagnosis to
get the right treatment.

How is peripheral T-cell
lymphoma identified?
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is often found
when a person notices a painless lump or
swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin. A lump
like this is caused by a swollen lymph node.
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma can also occur in
parts of the body that aren’t lymph nodes. This
is called extranodal disease, which means
outside the lymph nodes. These areas include
the bone marrow, spleen, liver, lungs, kidneys,
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and skin.
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma may also be
discovered by certain symptoms. A symptom is
a feeling or problem you have that can indicate
a disease or condition.

What’s the best treatment for PTCL?

What’s the best treatment for
peripheral T-cell lymphoma?

What are B symptoms?

There’s no single “best” treatment for
peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Treatment is
focused on you—your age, your current health,
how advanced your cancer is, and other
factors.

These three symptoms often occur in
people who have lymphoma. They’re
called B symptoms. Tell your doctor if
you have any of these symptoms.

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is often at an
advanced stage when it’s diagnosed. But
even for advanced lymphomas, treatment is
available.

Fever

The most common treatment for peripheral
T-cell lymphoma is a combination of
chemotherapy drugs. Other treatments may
include radiation therapy and possibly a bone
marrow transplant.
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas can be difficult to
treat, so several different types of treatment
may be required. Treatment may continue, off
and on, for the rest of your life.

Heavy sweats

It’s important to know that cancer treatment
today isn’t quite as uncomfortable and timeconsuming as in the past. A variety of different
chemotherapy drugs and treatment options are
now available. And there are medications to
prevent nausea, vomiting, and other common
side effects.

Unexplained weight loss

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, 2022

It’s also important to know that researchers
are constantly studying and developing more
effective treatments for cancers like peripheral
T-cell lymphoma. Treatments in the future are
likely to work better than those that have been
available up to now.

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma types

Lymphatic system

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a rare
type of cancer. It can be difficult to
diagnose, but it’s important to try to
find out which subtype you have. The
more your doctors know about your
lymphoma, the more precisely they can
treat it.

The lymphatic system is made up of:

To understand T-cell lymphomas, we need
to understand where they come from and
how they grow. T-cell lymphomas, like all
lymphomas, develop from lymphocytes (a type
of white blood cell) in the lymphatic system.

lymph fluid



lymphatic vessels



lymph nodes



lymphatic tissue (like bone marrow)



organs (like the spleen and thymus)

Lymph fluid gives cells water and food. It also
contains germ-fighting lymphocytes, including
T cells.
As lymph fluid travels through lymphatic
vessels throughout the body, lymph nodes
catch and filter out foreign particles and
harmful cells. Lymph nodes are small, beanshaped structures. Hundreds of lymph nodes
are located throughout the body. Lymph nodes
are usually clustered in groups in your neck,
chest, armpits, groin, pelvis, and along your
gut. (The ones in the neck are often called
“glands.”)

Lymphatic system
The lymphatic system is part of the immune
(infection-fighting) system. The lymphatic
system fights germs in the body and transports
a fluid called lymph.

Lymph nodes
Hundreds of small, bean-shaped

flu, or a sinus infection.

and NK-cell lymphomas. In this book, we’ll
focus on T cells.
There are many types of T cells, so there
are many T-cell cancers. T cells differ from
one another based on the cell’s stage of
development and what job the T cells have.
Very early forms (precursors) of T cells are
made in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is a
soft, spongy material inside of bones where
most blood cells are created.

Lymphomas are cancers that start in
lymphocytes within the lymphatic system.
There are three types of lymphocytes:


T cells



B cells



Natural killer (NK) cells

The immature T cells travel from the bone
marrow to the thymus, which is also part of the
immune system. In the thymus, the immature
T cells develop into mature T cells. (The T
in thymus gives the T cell its name.) As we
get older, immature T cells also develop in

Like T cells, B cells and NK cells help to fight
infections. Lymphomas can develop from these
lymphocytes too, namely B-cell lymphomas

Lymph system
Lymphocytes are produced
in bone marrow but further
change in lymph tissue to fight
disease. The tonsils, thymus,
spleen, and lymph nodes are
composed of lymph tissue.
There are hundreds of lymph
nodes in the body and many
are in the neck, armpits, and
groin.

the blood and in other parts of the lymphatic
system.

The three most common subtypes are:
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise
specified (PTCL-NOS)

When the T cells are mature, they’re ready to
help fight illness. They leave the thymus and
travel to the lymph nodes and other areas of
the lymphatic system. The T cells wait until
they’re summoned to attack invading germs.
Sometimes these healthy mature T cells
can even fight cancer cells. So it’s a double
loss when T cells develop abnormalities
and become cancer cells. Peripheral T-cell
lymphoma starts from these abnormal T cells.



Many people with PTCL-NOS have
painless swollen lymph nodes in the
neck or other parts of the body. In
some people, the liver or spleen can be
enlarged.



PTCL-NOS is a diagnosis of exclusion. In
other words, a peripheral T-cell lymphoma
that doesn’t look like any other subtype is
categorized as PTCL-NOS.



PTCL-NOS is also the most common
subtype—more than 30% of Americans
with peripheral T-cell lymphoma are
diagnosed with PTCL-NOS.



In the United States, PTCL-NOS is more
common in Blacks than in Whites.



PTCL-NOS tends to grow quickly and
should be treated as soon as possible.

Subtypes of peripheral T-cell
lymphomas
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is one of many
different types of lymphomas. Lymphomas
are divided into two categories: Hodgkin
lymphomas and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a type of nonHodgkin lymphoma.

Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
(AITL)

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a rare disease
in the United States. Some forms of peripheral
T-cell lymphoma are more common in Asia,
Africa, and the Caribbean than in the United
States.
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurs most often
in people aged 60 years and older. But it can
also develop in adults younger than 60 and in
children. It’s diagnosed slightly more often in
men than in women.
There are a number of subtypes of peripheral
T-cell lymphoma. These subtypes can be very
different from one another.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, 2022

15



Most people with AITL typically have
swollen lymph nodes in the neck or other
parts of the body, as well as an enlarged
liver or spleen. B symptoms (fevers, night
sweats, or unexplained weight loss) are
also common.



AITL is the second most common subtype
of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in the
United States, accounting for about 15%
of all cases.



In the United States, AITL is more
common among Asian/Pacific Islanders
and Hispanics than in Whites and Blacks.

2

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma types



AITL often grows quickly. Treatment
usually works in the beginning, but
the lymphoma is likely to come back
(relapse).

Subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphomas



ALK+ ALCL is more common in younger
adults while ALK− ALCL is more common
in people older than age 55.



ALK+ ALCL generally has a better
prognosis than ALK− ALCL.

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)


In addition to these three most common
subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, many
other subtypes also exist. See Guide 1.

Most people with ALCL typically have
painless swollen lymph nodes in the neck
or other parts of the body. B symptoms
also often occur.



This subtype accounts for an estimated
24% of peripheral T-cell lymphoma cases
in the United States.



The ALCL subtype can be either
ALK-positive (ALK+) or ALK-negative
(ALK−).

It’s important to try to identify your specific type
of T-cell lymphoma to make sure you get the
most appropriate care and treatment.

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma starts from

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurs most
often in older adults. But it can also

Diagnosis vs. prognosis
What’s the difference between your
diagnosis and your prognosis? These
two words sound alike but they’re very
different.

Diagnosis means identifying an

illness based on tests. Your diagnosis
names what illness you have.

There are many subtypes of peripheral
T-cell lymphoma. The three most common
subtypes in the United States are:
•

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma not
otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS)

•

Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
(AITL)

•

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)

Prognosis is the likely course and

outcome of a disease based on tests
and your response to treatment. Your
prognosis predicts how your illness will
turn out.

When T cells attack
A healthy T cell (orange cell)
helps fight infections caused
by invaders like bacteria
and viruses. Some healthy T
cells even fight cancer cells
(blue cell). So it’s a double
loss when T cells develop
abnormalities and become
cancer cells. Peripheral T-cell
lymphoma starts from these
abnormal T cells.

Tests you’ll take

If your doctor suspects that you have
peripheral T-cell lymphoma, you’ll need
a number of medical tests before you
receive treatment. Some tests check
your general health. Other tests are
for diagnosing your illness. All of these
tests help to figure out your diagnosis
and what treatment is best for you.

Tips for testing
Results from blood tests, imaging studies,
and biopsies will be used to determine
your treatment plan. It’s important you
understand what these tests mean. Ask
questions and keep copies of your test
results. Online patient portals are a great
way to access your test results.

The thought of cancer is scary. Having tests
for cancer can be scary, too. This chapter will
help you know what to expect during testing.
Testing will provide a diagnosis, which will help
to plan treatment. These steps can help put
thoughts into action, which may reduce some
of the fear.

Remember these tips for
testing:
• Bring someone with you to doctor
visits, if possible.

It’s not easy to find the right diagnosis for
peripheral T-cell lymphoma. There’s no single
test for it. Many different tests are required to
make a diagnosis. You’ll take some tests more
than once, perhaps several times. It’s a lot like
putting together the pieces of a puzzle to form
a picture. Each test adds a new piece to the
puzzle.

• Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid
to ask your care team questions. Get
to know your care team and let them
get to know you.

Of course, not everyone with peripheral T-cell
lymphoma may need all the tests described in
this chapter.

• Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on
your computer.

• Get copies of blood tests, imaging
results, and reports about the specific
type of cancer you have.

• Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add
it to your phone. Hang the list on
your refrigerator or keep it in a place
where someone can access it in an
emergency. Keep your primary care
physician informed of changes.

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma can cause “B
symptoms.” Be sure to let your doctor know if
you have any of these B symptoms:


Fevers



Drenching night sweats

A physical exam of your body is done to look
for signs of disease. It’s also used to help
assess what treatments may be options for
you. During this exam, your doctor or health
care provider may check:

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma may also affect
other organs, such as your GI tract. (The GI
tract is a series of organs—like the stomach
and intestines—that break down and digest
food.) GI symptoms may include diarrhea,
bloody stools, and pain in your belly.

Family history

Some cancers and other health conditions can
run in families. T-cell lymphomas typically do
not run in families. Be prepared to discuss the
health problems of your close blood relatives.
These include your brothers and sisters,
parents, and grandparents.

Swollen glands
Swelling of lymph nodes
(such as the “glands” in
your throat) is often one of
the first signs of lymphoma.
Lymph nodes may be so
swollen that they can be
easily felt or seen under the
skin. Your doctor will gently
press on the areas of your
body that have lymph nodes,
such as your neck, armpits,

Checking for swelling

Certain parts of your body should be checked
for swelling. Swelling of lymph nodes is often
one of the first signs of peripheral T-cell
lymphoma. Lymph nodes may be so swollen
that they can be easily felt or seen under the
skin. Your doctor will gently press on the areas
of your body that have lymph nodes, such
as your neck, armpits, and groin. Your doctor
will also feel your spleen and liver to assess
their size. Your oropharynx (the back part of
your throat, behind your mouth) may also be
assessed for signs of cancer, too.

Imaging makes pictures of the inside of your
body. It’s used to detect cancer in deep lymph
nodes, organs, bone marrow, and other
parts of the body. Imaging provides useful
information to determine the extent of cancer
involvement.
Your treatment team will tell you how to
prepare for the test. You may need to stop
taking some medicines and stop eating and
drinking for a few hours before the scan.

Checking your skin

Imaging machines are large. You’ll lie down on
a table that slides into the machine. At least
part of your body will be in the machine. Tell
your doctors if you get nervous when in small
spaces. You may be given a sedative to help
you relax. Imaging machines can also be loud.
You’ll be given earplugs or headphones to help
block out the noise.

Checking your physical ability

After the test, you should be able to resume
your normal activities right away. If you took
a sedative, you’ll be given time to recover.
Meanwhile, the scans will be sent to a
radiologist for review. A radiologist is a doctor
who’s an expert in reading the images. The
radiologist will send the results of imaging to
your doctor.

Another symptom of some peripheral T-cell
lymphomas is a rash or rashes on your skin.
Your oncologist (a doctor who specializes
in cancer) or a dermatologist (a doctor who
specializes in skin diseases) may ask to
examine the skin on your body.

Your doctor or health care provider will also
rate your overall health and ability to do basic
daily activities like walking, cleaning, bathing,
and so forth. This is known as performance
status. Doctors rate your performance status
to determine if you can undergo certain
treatments. This helps find the treatment that’s
best suited for you.

PET/CT



Positron emission tomography (PET) and
computed tomography (CT or CAT scan) are
two types of imaging. When used together,
they’re called a PET/CT scan. The PET/CT
scan is used to image your whole body. Some
cancer centers have one machine that does
both tests at the same time.


PET scan shows whether the cells in your
body are functioning normally. It highlights
cells that may be cancerous. It can show
even small amounts of cancer. A PET
scan requires injecting a substance called
a radiotracer into your bloodstream. The
radiotracer is detected with a special
camera during the scan. It makes cancer
cells appear brighter on the images.
Afterward, the radiotracer is passed out of
your body in your urine.

In addition, you may need a CT or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your
head and a CT scan of your neck to look for
cancerous lymph nodes.

PET/CT scan
Imaging instruments,
like this PET/CT
scanner, can show
what’s going on
inside your body.
During the scan,
you lie on a table
that moves into
the tunnel of the
machine. The scan
can detect even
small amounts of
cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, 2022

CT scan uses x-rays to take many
images of your body from different angles.
A computer then combines the pictures
to make a 3-D image. If a PET scan
isn’t available, a CT scan of your chest,
belly area, and between your hip bones
is needed. A contrast agent (also called
contrast dye) is used to make the pictures
clearer. Contrast is often injected into the
bloodstream and flushed out in urine.

Tests you’ll take

Blood tests

Blood tests

There are five types of white blood cells. A
“differential” counts the number of each type
of white blood cell. It also checks if the cell
counts are in balance with each other. White
cell counts that are unusually high or low
can suggest the possibility of cancer or other
illnesses.

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma can cause
abnormal blood counts. Doctors test blood to
look for this and other signs of disease. Blood
tests are also used to learn when treatment
should begin. A sample of your blood is
removed with a needle inserted into a vein.
This is called a blood draw.

Comprehensive metabolic panel

Your liver, bone, and other organs release
chemicals into your blood. A comprehensive
metabolic panel includes tests for up to 14 of
these chemicals. The tests show if the levels
of chemicals are too low or high. Abnormal
levels can be caused by cancer or other health
problems.

Tests that may be done with your blood sample
include:

CBC with differential

A complete blood count (CBC) measures
parts of the blood. Test results include
measurements of white blood cells, red blood
cells, and platelets. Cancer and other health
problems can cause low or high counts.

Checking your skin
A rash can be a symptom of peripheral
T-cell lymphoma. A doctor may use a
dermascope to look at your skin.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, 2022

Tests you’ll take

Blood tests

LDH

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a protein
that’s in almost all cells. Dying cells release
LDH into the blood. High levels of LDH can be
caused by cancer or other health problems. If
related to lymphoma, high levels may be a sign
that treatment may be needed soon.

Your pathology report
Lab results used for diagnosis are put
into a pathology report. This report
will be sent to your doctor. It’s used to
plan your treatment. A meeting among
all your doctors may be helpful for
treatment planning once the pathology
report is finished.

Uric acid

Uric acid is a normal waste product that’s
released by cells and is filtered by the kidneys.
But high levels of uric acid can be due to
fast-growing cancer, kidney disease, or other
health problems. High uric acid can also be
a side effect of chemotherapy or radiation
therapy.

Hepatitis test

Some types of cancer treatments can weaken
your immune system. This increases your
chance of getting infections. Hepatitis B and
hepatitis C infections in particular can become
active again after certain cancer therapies. So
it’s important to be tested for hepatitis viruses
before you start treatment.

HTLV test

Testing for human T-cell lymphotropic
virus (HTLV) can sometimes be helpful for
people who appear to have peripheral T-cell
lymphoma. In rare cases, HTLV can cause
adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. This type
of T-cell lymphoma can look very similar to
peripheral T-cell lymphoma, but is treated
differently. So it can be useful to get tested for
HTLV to make sure you’re being treated for
your correct cancer subtype.

HIV test

People with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) tend to have a weakened immune
system. So if you have peripheral T-cell
lymphoma, it’s important to know whether you
also have HIV. An HIV antibody test checks for
HIV antibodies in a sample of blood, urine, or
saliva.
If you haven’t been tested for HIV, you may
be tested as part of your treatment plan. If
you have HIV, treating it is an important part
of treating peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Also,
cancer treatment works better in people who
get treated for their HIV.

Biopsies

Biopsies

the lymph node is just below the skin, you’ll
be given a local anesthetic, which numbs only
the area of skin and just below the skin. If the
lymph node is deeper in the body, you may be
given a general anesthetic, which means you’ll
be asleep during the biopsy.

The only way to be sure that you have cancer
is to test fluid or tissue from your body. A
biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample
of fluid or tissue for testing. A biopsy is
generally a safe test and can often be done in
about 30 to 60 minutes.
Several types of biopsies are used to diagnose
peripheral T-cell lymphoma:

Lymph node biopsy

An incisional biopsy removes only a part
of the tissue that may have cancer.



An excisional biopsy removes all of the
tissue, such as an entire lymph node.

For either procedure, the surgeon will start
by cleaning the skin where the biopsy will be
done. Then the surgeon will make a small cut
just big enough to remove the lymph node
tissue. Lastly, the surgeon will close up the cut
with stitches and cover it with a bandage. The
tissue sample will be sent to a laboratory after
the biopsy is done.

Because peripheral T-cell lymphoma typically
affects lymph nodes, a lymph node biopsy is
common. This biopsy removes lymph node
tissue through a cut into your skin.
The duration and complexity of this biopsy
depend on the location of the lymph node. If

Bone marrow biopsy
Doctors use a bone marrow
biopsy and aspiration to
remove samples of solid
bone marrow and liquid
bone marrow for testing.
These tests are often done
at the same time on the
pelvic bone.

3

Tests you’ll take

Biopsies
Skin biopsy

In certain cases when the lymph node is
difficult to reach, a core needle biopsy may
be done. For a core needle biopsy, the doctor
uses a long, hollow needle to remove a small
tissue sample (core) from the lymph node.

Peripheral T-cell lymphomas and other T-cell
lymphomas may involve the skin. Based on
your skin exam, your doctor may want you to
have a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy removes a
sample of one or two layers of skin, which is
tested for cancer.

A biopsy may also be taken from an organ or
tissue such as the liver or intestine.

Before the biopsy, the area of skin will be
numbed with anesthesia. You may feel
pressure during the biopsy. Afterward, your
doctor will close the wound and apply a
bandage. There are usually no side effects, but
some people do get scars.

Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma sometimes
develops in bone marrow, which is part of the
lymph system. You may need a bone marrow
biopsy to confirm if there’s cancer.
A bone marrow biopsy removes a sample of
bone and soft bone marrow. A bone marrow
aspiration removes liquid bone marrow. Both
procedures are often done at the same time
on the back of the hip bone, which contains a
large amount of bone marrow.
You may receive a light sedative before the
test to help you relax. Your doctor will then
clean the area and you’ll be given anesthesia
to numb the skin and the bone beneath.
Once the area is numb, a hollow needle will be
inserted into the bone and rotated to remove a
sample of bone and soft marrow. You’ll notice
a feeling of pressure as this is happening and
you might feel some pain while the samples
are being removed. Afterward, your skin may
be bruised for a few days. After the tissue
samples are collected, they’ll be sent to a lab
for testing.

Diagnostic tests

Diagnostic tests

Immunophenotyping for peripheral T-cell
lymphoma also typically looks for proteins
CD2, CD3, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD20, CD30,
BCL6, Ki-67, ALK, and many others. Each of
these proteins performs a different job for the
cell.

Cancers of blood cells are difficult to tell apart.
Diagnostic tests can help reveal which cancer
you have.
For these tests, your blood and tissue
samples will be sent to a laboratory. At the
laboratory, a doctor called a hematopathologist
will view the samples under a microscope.
Hematopathologists are experts at diagnosing
cancers of blood cells. They can identify
different types of cancer by viewing the size,
shape, and arrangement of cells under the
microscope.

Besides identifying the subtype,
immunophenotyping is used to estimate how
aggressive the cancer is.
Immunophenotyping can also suggest which
type of treatment might work best against the
cancer. For example, anaplastic large cell
lymphoma (ALCL) is a subtype that has a lot
of CD30 protein. Scientists have developed
a treatment—brentuximab vedotin—that
targets and destroys cancer cells with the
CD30 protein. So the preferred treatment for
the ALCL subtype now includes brentuximab
vedotin. Newer treatments like this are often
more effective and may have fewer side effects
than standard chemotherapy.

If cancer cells are found, the
hematopathologist will test the cells for certain
proteins and genetic abnormalities. It often
takes several days before the test results are
known.
Diagnostic tests that may be performed
on your samples include protein tests and
biomarker tests.

Biomarker tests

Biomarker testing looks for biological clues of
cancer. Biomarkers can be genes, proteins,
or genetic changes (mutations). They can be
found in your tissues, blood, or other bodily
fluids.

Protein tests

Cancer cells can be detected by specific
proteins found on the surface of the cells.
The presence or absence of these proteins
can help determine the diagnosis and
type of the cancer. That is, each subtype
of peripheral T-cell lymphoma has its own
pattern or “signature” of proteins. This is called
immunophenotyping.

Biomarker testing can be used to:

By detecting this “signature,” the
hematopathologist can diagnose a subtype
based on which proteins it has and which
ones it doesn’t have. For example, a specific
subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma may
have the CD4 protein but not the CD5 protein.

Tests you’ll take

Fertility and pregnancy | Heart tests

Doctors can use biomarkers to help identify
some peripheral T-cell lymphoma subtypes
and choose the right treatment for them.
For example, certain genetic abnormalities
can point to specific subtypes, such as
ALK+ ALCL. In this subtype, a specific
genetic abnormality—a rearrangement of the
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene—is
found in all cases of ALK+ ALCL.

Ask if the
hematopathologist
who’s testing
your samples
has experience in
diagnosing peripheral
T-cell lymphoma.

But there is much more to learn. Scientists are
constantly looking for more biomarkers that
can provide more answers for better diagnosis
and treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

Fertility and pregnancy

Heart tests

Some cancer treatments may affect your ability
to conceive or bear children. However, options
are available. Sperm can be frozen and stored
in a sperm bank until after cancer treatment.
Like sperm banking, eggs can be removed
from ovaries and stored for later use. Discuss
your thoughts and preferences with your
doctors.

Some cancer treatments can damage your
heart. To plan treatment, your doctor may test
how well your heart is working. You may get
an echocardiogram or a multigated acquisition
(MUGA) scan. An echocardiogram uses sound
waves to make pictures of your heart. A MUGA
scan makes pictures using a radiotracer and
a special camera. If your heart isn’t working
well, your doctor may avoid using certain
chemotherapy drugs that could cause further
damage to your heart.

Some cancer treatments can harm an unborn
baby. If you might be pregnant now, get a
pregnancy test before your treatment. Also,
take steps to avoid getting pregnant or causing
a pregnancy during treatment. Your doctors
can tell you which birth control methods are
best to use.

Staging

Staging
Staging is a method that oncologists use to
describe the extent of cancer in the body. It’s
based on the results of a person’s imaging
scans, biopsies, and blood tests. Staging can
be used to estimate your prognosis and to help
choose the best treatment or the right clinical
trial for you.
Staging is often described as early stage or
late (advanced) stage. This is expressed using
numbers 1 to 4. Early stage disease is defined
as stage 1 and 2 while late or advanced stage
disease is stage 3 and 4. For peripheral T-cell
lymphoma, the cancer stages are:


Stage 2 – Cancer in two or more groups
of lymph nodes in the same area of the
body



Stage 3 – Cancer in lymph nodes in
different areas of the body or cancer in
lymph nodes in the same area of the body
and in the spleen



Stage 4 – Stage 1, 2, or 3 plus cancer
found in other organs like the liver, lung,
kidneys, GI tract, or bone marrow

Staging is helpful to make treatment decisions.
It helps determine if you need systemic
treatment alone or if systemic treatment should
be combined with local treatment like radiation.
Systemic treatment affects the entire body.

Stage 1 – Cancer in one lymph node or a
single cluster of lymph nodes

First-line therapy (also known as upfront
treatment) is the first type of treatment given
for a condition or disease. A first-line treatment
is one that generally provides the best results
with the fewest side effects. A side effect is an
unhealthy or unpleasant physical or emotional
condition caused by treatment.
The goal of first-line therapy is to be cured, if
possible. If a cure is not possible, then the goal
is to achieve long-term remission or control of
the cancer. Remission means the cancer isn’t
detectable and isn’t causing any symptoms
after treatment.
First-line therapy can be a single type of
treatment, such as chemotherapy, or it
can be a combination of treatments, such
as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Sometimes two or more treatments are used
together for a greater effect.

body. Treatment that affects the whole body is
called systemic therapy.

Chemotherapy (“chemo”) is the use of drugs
to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs kill
fast-growing cells throughout the body. Cancer
cells are fast-growing cells, but some normal
cells are fast-growing, too. Different types of
chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to kill
cancer cells or stop new ones from being made.

For peripheral T-cell lymphoma treatment, a
few chemotherapy drugs are often given at
the same time. This is called multi-agent or
combination chemotherapy. The advantage of
multi-agent chemotherapy is that each drug
has its own way of attacking the lymphoma.
This gives the combination a better chance
of overpowering the cancer. Plus, it’s much
harder for the cancer to develop resistance to
a combination of drugs than to a single drug.

Many chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are
injected slowly into a vein (IV infusion). Some
are pills that are swallowed. The drugs travel in
the bloodstream to treat cancer throughout the

First-line therapy

Chemotherapy

Medicines used in first-line
chemotherapy combinations
Certain medicines that aren’t chemotherapeutic drugs are often given as part
of first-line chemotherapy combinations. For example, one of the preferred
first-line therapy regimens for peripheral T-cell lymphoma consists of a drug
conjugate (brentuximab vedotin), two chemotherapy drugs (cyclophosphamide
and doxorubicin), and a corticosteroid (prednisone). These drugs can boost the
overall effect of chemotherapy and may help reduce side effects.

Brentuximab vedotin
• Brentuximab vedotin is a drug conjugate used
as a first-line treatment for peripheral T-cell
lymphomas that have the CD30 protein. A drug
conjugate combines two drugs in one medicine:
One drug finds and binds to certain cancer cells
and the other drug directly attacks the cancer
cells without harming other cells. Brentuximab
vedotin is called a targeted therapy because it
specifically targets cancer cells that have the
CD30 protein.

• The most common side effects of
brentuximab vedotin include fatigue, low
blood counts, tingling or numbness in
hands and feet, nausea, diarrhea, fever,
rash, and lung infections. Rare but severe
side effects include brain infection,
serious disorder of skin and mucous
membranes, and kidney problems.

Corticosteroids (often called “steroids”)
• These drugs are used to relieve swelling and
• Common side effects of steroids include
inflammation. Some steroids also have antifeeling hungry, trouble sleeping, mood
cancer effects. Plus, steroids help chemotherapy

away once the steroid is stopped.

Growth factors
• Growth factors are drugs that boost the immune system. Chemotherapy can weaken the
immune system. Growth factors help restore your immune system after chemotherapy.
Growth factors can be given as a daily injection under the skin or as a single injection that
keeps working in the body for several weeks. Not everyone who receives chemotherapy
needs growth factors.

First-line therapy

Chemotherapy

Treatment for peripheral T-cell lymphoma
usually involves a mix of liquid drugs. You’ll sit
in a chair or bed at the hospital or clinic while
receiving the medicine. A treatment session
can range from a few minutes to a few hours.

Don’t disregard a fever

Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment
days followed by days of rest. This allows the
body to recover before the next treatment
cycle. Cycles vary in length depending on
which drugs are used. Often, the cycles
are 14, 21, or 28 days long. The number
of treatment days per cycle and the total
number of cycles given also vary based on the
chemotherapy used.

Chemotherapy can weaken your
immune system and make you more
likely to get infections. One sign of an
infection is a fever. If you have a fever
while receiving chemotherapy, you
need to contact your treatment team.
Make sure to ask for a phone number
you can call if you get a fever or have
another urgent problem.

Common side effects of chemotherapy are
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores,
loss of appetite, hair loss, and low blood cell
counts. Feeling very tired (fatigue) or weak is
also common.

Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

Side effects of chemotherapy are generally
caused by the death of fast-growing cells,
which are found in the intestines, mouth,
blood, skin, and hair follicles. But the side
effects of chemotherapy depend on many
other factors, too. These include the drug, the
dose, and the person.

For peripheral T-cell lymphoma, radiation
therapy is given in very specific instances after
chemotherapy as part of first-line treatment.
Radiation therapy is used to destroy any
remaining cancer cells that are left behind after
chemo.

Not everyone experiences the same side
effects or number of side effects. Also, not all
side effects of chemotherapy are listed here.
Ask your treatment team for a complete list
of common and rare side effects. If any side
effect bothers you, tell your treatment team.
There may be ways to help you feel better.
There are also ways to prevent some side
effects.

In people who can’t have chemotherapy,
radiation therapy may be used alone to
relieve pain or other symptoms caused by the
lymphoma or by other treatment.
Radiation therapy involves a large machine
that sends out high-energy rays to a specific
area of the body. The rays damage the DNA in
cancer cells. This either kills the cancer cells or
stops new cancer cells from being made. You
won’t see, hear, or feel the radiation. It passes

through your skin and other tissues to reach
the lymphoma. (Radiation therapy won’t make
you radioactive.)

Other side effects occur in treated areas, such
as redness of the skin or hair loss. The side
effects of radiation therapy usually go away by
2 to 4 weeks after the treatment ends.

Radiation therapy is a type of local therapy.
Local therapy treats cancer cells only in a
specific area of the body. If you’re having
radiation therapy, a radiation oncologist will
come up with a treatment plan that tries to
avoid harming any important organs or other
parts of your body. To help accomplish this,
imaging with CT, PET, or MRI may be needed
to plan or to perform radiation therapy.
During treatment, you’ll lie on the treatment
table and be told how to get into position
needed for treatment. You need to remain very
still during radiation treatment. Devices may be
used to keep you from moving.

We want your
feedback!

You’ll be alone in the room while the radiology
technician operates the machine from a
nearby control room. The technician will be
able to see, hear, and speak with you through
an intercom and video system. One treatment
session takes about 15 to 30 minutes—only
a few minutes of the session involve actual
radiation time. Radiation therapy usually
requires a series of treatment sessions over
several weeks.

Our goal is to provide helpful
and easy-to-understand
information on cancer.

Side effects of radiation therapy differ among
people. Factors like the location of the
radiation on your body, radiation dose, and
length of treatment all play a role. Side effects
are cumulative, meaning they may not be too
severe in the first few visits but will get worse
over the course of treatment. Over time, you
may have nausea, diarrhea, or fatigue. You
may lose your appetite and may even lose
weight during treatment.

Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).
Participating in a clinical trial isn’t a “last-ditch”
effort. A clinical trial is a first-line treatment
option for many people with lymphoma.
Clinical trials give people access to options
that they couldn’t usually receive otherwise.
Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials.



Phase I trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of a drug or treatment
approach. They also look for early signs
that the drug or approach is helpful.



Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.



Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Who can enroll?

NCCN recommends that people with
peripheral T-cell lymphoma consider a clinical
trial as their first-line therapy, if available.

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

Talk to your doctors about whether a clinical
trial is recommended for you.

Informed consent

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and benefits
of joining. All of this information is also provided
in an informed consent form. Read the form
carefully and ask questions before signing it.
Take time to discuss with family, friends, or
other people who you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Start the conversation

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you’ve
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try not
to be discouraged if you can’t join. New clinical
trials are always becoming available.

Restaging

Restaging

To read about second-line therapy, go to
Chapter 5.

You read about staging in Chapter 3.
Restaging means evaluating the extent of a
person’s cancer after some treatment has
been given. Restaging can occur during the
middle of treatment to check how well it’s
working. Restaging can also be done after
treatment is over or if the cancer comes back
or has spread.

Complete response or partial response
People who have a complete response or a
partial response to first-line therapy will finish
the treatment and be restaged again. They
may have additional therapy or something
called consolidation therapy. For more
information about additional and consolidation
therapy, turn to Chapter 6.

During restaging, you’ll repeat some of the
same tests that you did before you were first
diagnosed. For peripheral T-cell lymphoma,
restaging occurs after 3 or 4 cycles of first-line
chemotherapy and is done with PET/CT or
other imaging. The results give doctors an idea
of how your cancer is responding to treatment.

Two types of survival

Responses to treatment:


Complete response means there are no
signs of lymphoma after treatment.



Partial response is when the size or
extent of the lymphoma has decreased
after treatment.



No response after treatment means
the cancer is stable with no significant
change—it didn’t grow but it didn’t shrink.

You may hear or read about different
terms for survival, such as overall
survival and progression-free survival.
In a clinical trial, measuring either form
of survival can show how well a new
treatment works. But what do these
terms really mean?

Overall survival: How long a person

Progressive disease means that the
cancer is growing and/or spreading
despite treatment.

remains alive after the start of their
cancer. The “start of their cancer” can be
either the date it’s diagnosed or the date
when treatment begins.

What’s next? It depends on how well the
lymphoma responds to treatment:

Progression-free survival: How



long a person goes after the start of
treatment without the cancer getting
worse.

No response or progressive disease

People who have no response or progressive
disease will move on to second-line therapy.

It’s normal to feel worried
Depression, anxiety, fear, and distress are very common feelings
in people with cancer. These feelings can make it harder to deal

when you want to move forward. Getting help when you’re feeling
worried or hopeless is an important part of cancer care. If you’re
feeling anxious or overwhelmed, ask your treatment team for help.

Second-line therapy

Second-line therapy

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma may come
back after the first line of treatment.
The goal of second-line treatment is to
stop it from getting worse and to keep
it from coming back again.
After first-line treatment, a lymphoma may
not get better. It may even get worse. This
is called refractory disease—it means the
cancer didn’t respond to treatment.
On the other hand, cancer may get better
or even be in remission after treatment,
but then come back again. This is called
a relapse or recurrence. In many people,
peripheral T-cell lymphoma often improves
with treatment but eventually relapses.
The treatment for refractory and relapsed
lymphoma is second-line therapy.

Second-line therapy
The goal of second-line therapy is to achieve
remission. Remission is when some or all
of the signs and symptoms of cancer have
disappeared.

Stem cell transplant:
To proceed or not to proceed?
A clinical trial is the preferred treatment option
for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell
lymphoma. But the choice of second-line
therapy is also based on whether or not a
patient is eligible for a stem cell transplant.
A stem cell transplant is a procedure that
replaces damaged or destroyed stem cells
with healthy stem cells. The healthy stem
cells help to grow new blood cells.
A stem cell transplant is an intense treatment.
It’s not for everyone. It tends to be more
successful in people who’ve had a complete
or partial response to chemotherapy. A stem
cell transplant is usually performed after
second-line therapy is completed. (For more
information about stem cell transplants, see
Chapter 6.)
For patients with relapsed or refractory
peripheral T-cell lymphoma who are ineligible
for a stem cell transplant, the goal is to keep
them in remission for as long as possible
while maintaining their quality of life. Quality
of life involves a person’s overall enjoyment
of life, including their sense of well-being and
ability to participate in regular activities.

Clinical trial | Single agents

Clinical trial

Preferred single-agent drugs include:

The preferred treatment option for all patients
with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell
lymphoma is a clinical trial. Clinical trials give
people access to treatment options that they
couldn’t usually receive otherwise.

Belinostat

Belinostat can be used as a single agent
for second-line therapy. It’s only for patients
with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell
lymphoma. It’s given by IV infusion into a vein.

A clinical trial is not a “last ditch” treatment.
It’s considered a first-line therapy in many
people with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. An
NCCN panel of lymphoma experts strongly
encourages people with relapsed or refractory
peripheral T-cell lymphoma to enroll in a
clinical trial if one is open and is the right fit.

Brentuximab vedotin

Brentuximab vedotin is a drug conjugate that
combines two drugs in one medicine (so it’s
still considered a single agent for second-line
therapy). Brentuximab vedotin specifically
targets cancer cells that have the CD30
protein. So it’s only given to patients whose
lab results show cancer cells with the CD30
protein.

Single agents

Pralatrexate

If a clinical trial isn’t available or isn’t the right
choice, then second-line therapy for peripheral
T-cell lymphoma involves chemotherapy.

Pralatrexate is a type of drug called a folate
analogue metabolic inhibitor. The drug works
by blocking (inhibiting) cancer cells from using
folate, an essential B vitamin. Without folate,
cancer cells can’t multiply. Pralatrexate is
only for patients with relapsed or refractory
peripheral T-cell lymphoma. It’s given by IV
infusion once a week for 6 weeks. After a
1-week break, the cycle is started over again.

But what type of chemotherapy? And should it
be a combination of chemotherapy drugs or a
single drug (also called a single agent)?
The choice of combination chemotherapy or a
single agent should be based on factors like
your age, physical ability (performance status),
the type of T-cell lymphoma, the potential drug
side effects, and the goals of therapy.

Romidepsin

Romidepsin is a single-agent drug that shuts
down histones. Histones are proteins that are
necessary for the formation of DNA in cancer
cells. Without histones, cancer cells can die.
Romidepsin is an IV infusion given once a
week for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week break.

Single agents are useful for some people
because they’re simple to take, cause fewer
or less harsh side effects, and still reduce
symptoms. Newer single agent drugs may
be more tolerable and equally effective as
combination chemotherapy. Talk to your doctor
about the different options and their risks and
benefits.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, 2022

All single-agent drugs have side effects such
as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tiredness,
infection, fever, loss of appetite, and others.

Combination chemotherapy

Combination chemotherapy
can include drugs given as an
intravenous (IV) infusion

For second-line therapy, a combination of
drugs may be a better choice than a single
agent for certain patients. These may be
people who are comparatively younger, have
good or adequate physical ability, or can
handle a more difficult treatment regimen.
Combination chemo may also be appropriate
in people who are eligible for a stem cell
transplant after second-line therapy.
Second-line combination chemotherapy
usually includes drugs that are different from
those used in first-line chemotherapy. Some
of these are platinum-based chemotherapy
drugs (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin).
These drugs disrupt DNA inside cancer cells,
which causes the cells to die. Platinum-based
chemotherapies are effective, but they can
cause severe side effects. Also, cancer tends
to quickly develop resistance to these drugs.

Palliative radiation therapy

Treatment response

Palliative means relieving symptoms that are
caused by the cancer or other treatmentrelated side effects. Palliative therapy is meant
to improve quality of life.

What happens after second-line therapy? Your
doctors and treatment team—with your input—
will make that decision based on how your
lymphoma has responded to treatment.

The purpose of palliative radiation therapy is to
reduce cancer symptoms like pain or bleeding,
and prevent symptoms from occurring.
Palliative radiation therapy targets cancer cells
only in a certain area of the body. This means
that lower doses of radiation can be used and
the treatment cycle can be shorter.

Importantly, the next phase of therapy depends
on whether a stem cell transplant is a goal of
your treatment plan:

Stem cell transplant:


Complete response or partial response
Treatment options for people who have a
complete or partial response to secondline therapy include a clinical trial or a
stem cell transplant. For more information
about stem cell transplants, turn to
Chapter 6.



No response or progressive disease
People who have no response or
progressive disease will move on to the
next line of therapy or follow-up care.

Supportive care
Supportive care aims to improve quality of life.
It includes care for health issues caused by
cancer and cancer treatment. Supportive care
(also called palliative care) is important at any
stage of cancer, not just at the end of life.
Supportive care addresses many needs. It can
help with making treatment decisions. It can
also assist with coordinating care between
health providers. Notably, supportive care can
help prevent or treat physical and emotional
symptoms.

No stem cell transplant:

Of course, supportive care can also help with
spiritual support, advance care planning (which
means deciding what you would want if you
become too sick to make medical decisions for
yourself), and end-of-life concerns.



Supportive care aims to improve quality of
life. It’s important at any stage of cancer,
not just at the end of life.



Observation means your doctors will
test you regularly for cancer growth. You
won’t receive treatment unless something
changes.

Every 6 to 12 months – PET or PET/CT
imaging for cancer surveillance

If any symptoms return, don’t wait until your
next visit. Contact your doctor.
In rare cases, a person’s lymphoma returns
but grows at a slow pace and doesn’t cause
any symptoms. Observation may be an option
in these patients, particularly those who aren’t
expected to have a stem cell transplant.
Observation means your doctors will watch for
cancer growth with regular follow-up tests over
a period of time. No treatment is given unless
symptoms appear or your condition changes.
If symptoms come back or your condition
changes during follow-up, you may need
further treatment. For more information about
further treatment, see Chapter 6.

Consolidation and additional therapy

Clinical trial | Stem cell transplant

Stem cell transplant

Consolidation and additional therapy
are used to “clean up” any cancer
left behind after first- or second-line
therapies. A stem cell transplant can be
a key part of this stage of therapy.

A stem cell is a basic cell that develops into
other types of cells. Blood stem cells are made
in the bone marrow and make blood cells. But
cancer and its treatment—especially when
used in high doses—can damage and destroy
cells in the bone marrow. A stem cell transplant
(also called a bone marrow transplant) is a
way to kickstart the bone marrow to make
more healthy blood cells.

People with peripheral T-cell lymphoma
who’ve had a partial or complete response
to therapy—that is, when their signs and
symptoms of lymphoma have decreased
or disappeared—may be eligible to have
consolidation therapy and additional therapy.

A stem cell transplant starts with chemotherapy
that destroys cells in the bone marrow. These
cells are replaced with healthy stem cells. The
healthy stem cells grow bone marrow and new
blood cells. A stem cell transplant is performed
after other treatments (first- or second-line
therapy) have already been given.

The purpose of consolidation therapy is to
“clean up” any cancer cells that are left behind
after first-line or second-line therapy. The
goal is to prevent or delay the lymphoma from
coming back.

A stem cell transplant can be an intense
procedure. Doctors consider many factors
when deciding who will benefit from this
treatment. Some of these factors include your
fitness level, health status, organ function,
cancer stage, previous treatments, other
medical conditions, available supportive care,
and additional factors—including your goals
and preferences.

Consolidation and additional therapy

Stem cell transplant

There are two types of stem cell transplants:




Autologous transplant - An autologous
stem cell transplant uses your own
blood stem cells to regrow bone marrow.
It’s also called high-dose therapy with
autologous stem cell rescue (HDT/
ASCR). First, some of your healthy stem
cells will be removed from your bone
marrow or peripheral blood. Next, you’ll
receive intensive chemotherapy to kill the
cancer cells in your body. It will also kill
the blood-producing cells in your bone
marrow. Lastly, your healthy stem cells
will be infused (no surgery) into your body
to “rescue” your bone marrow.

Allogeneic transplant - An allogeneic
transplant uses healthy stem cells from
another person (donor). First, you’ll
receive treatment called conditioning
to kill your bone marrow cells. Next,
you’ll receive an infusion of donor cells.
These cells will form new, healthy bone
marrow, which will make healthy red
and white blood cells. They’ll also attack
cancer cells that weren’t killed by earlier
treatment.

Autologous transplant is sometimes chosen
after first-line therapy, while allogeneic stem
cell transplant is often recommended after
second-line therapy. For people with refractory

Autologous stem cell transplant
First, stem cells are removed (“harvested”) from the patient’s blood or bone marrow.
Second, the harvested stem cells are concentrated and frozen for preservation. Meanwhile,
the patient receives high-dose chemotherapy to destroy any cancer cells in the bone
marrow. Lastly, the stem cells are returned (“transfused”) to the patient, where they’ll grow
healthy new cells in the bone marrow.

or relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma,
allogeneic stem cell transplant can be
more effective but also more risky than an
autologous stem cell transplant.

Follow-up occurs after completing treatment.
The goal of follow-up care is to watch out
for the cancer to come back or to get worse.
During follow-up, you’ll have regular visits with
your doctor or oncologist.

In some cases, radiation therapy can be used
on specific (local) areas of lymphoma before or
after high-dose chemotherapy.

Here’s the usual follow-up schedule for
peripheral T-cell lymphoma:

A type of allogeneic transplant that involves
less chemotherapy is called a reduced
intensity transplant. This type of transplant
relies on the donor cells’ ability to attack and
destroy cancer cells. A reduced intensity
transplant is used more often in older
patients and those who can’t tolerate intense
chemotherapy.



Every 3 to 6 months – Doctor’s visit for a
clinical history and physical exam.



Every 6 to 12 months – PET or PET/CT
imaging for cancer surveillance

If any symptoms return (recurrence), don’t wait
until your next visit. Contact your doctor right
away. For more information about relapse, see
Chapter 5.

Side effects of stem cell transplant

High-dose chemotherapy can result in nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, and mouth
sores. You’ll likely feel tired and weak after the
transplant and while waiting for the new blood
stem cells to grow in the bone marrow. This
weak and unpleasant feeling might last for
several weeks after you go home, too.

Treatment doesn’t necessarily end after
second-line therapy. If symptoms come back
or your condition changes during follow-up,
you can try more treatment. Treatment may
continue, off and on, for the rest of your life.

Also, you’ll have to be extra careful to
avoid germs in the first few weeks after the
procedure because your infection-fighting
immune system will be almost gone.

This can include one or more of the following
options:

regrow bone marrow.

We want your
feedback!

An allogeneic transplant uses healthy
stem cells from a donor.

Our goal is to provide helpful
and easy-to-understand
information on cancer.

An allogeneic stem cell transplant can be
more effective but also more risky than an
autologous stem cell transplant for people
with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.



Follow-up care comes after completing
treatment. The goal is to watch out for the
cancer to come back or to get worse.



Treatment doesn’t necessarily end after
first-line or second-line therapy. It may
continue, off and on, for the rest of your
life.

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable with
the treatment you choose. This choice
starts with having an open and honest
conversation with your doctors.

specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
If you make the effort to build a relationship
with your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions. Learning about lymphoma
will help you make better treatment decisions
as you talk with your doctor.

It’s your choice

Deciding on your treatment options

In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Choosing your treatment is a very important
decision. It can affect your length and quality
of life. But deciding which treatment option is
best can be hard. Doctors from different fields
of medicine may have different opinions on
which option is best for you. This can be very
confusing. Also, your spouse, partner, or family
members may disagree with which option you
want. That can be stressful. In some cases,
one option hasn’t been shown to work better
than another.

Treatment decisions are very personal. What’s
important to you may not be important to
someone else.
Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Availability of clinical trials in your area



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
chemotherapy or stem cell therapy



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Here are some ways to help you decide on
treatment.

Second opinion

People with cancer often want to get treated
as soon as possible. They want to make their
cancer go away before it grows any further.
While cancer can’t be ignored, there is usually
enough time to think about and choose which
option is best for you.
You may completely trust your doctor, but a
second opinion about which option is best
can help. A second opinion is when another
doctor reviews your test results and suggests a
treatment plan. Copies of the pathology report,
imaging, and other test results need to be sent
to the doctor giving the second opinion. Some
people feel uneasy asking for copies from

Think about what you want from treatment.

Questions to ask your doctors

their doctors. However, a second opinion
is a normal part of cancer care and most
doctors are very comfortable helping you
to get a second opinion. Even doctors get
second opinions!
Some health plans require a second
opinion. If your health plan doesn’t cover the
cost of a second opinion, you have the choice
of paying for it yourself.

Get group support
Many people with cancer find a lot of
value in a support group. In support
groups, you can ask questions and hear
about the experiences of other people
with cancer. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment.

If the two opinions are the same, you may
feel more at peace about treatment. If the
two opinions differ, think about getting a third
opinion. A third opinion may help you decide
between your options. It’s your cancer, and the
decision about which treatment is best is your
decision.

A support group can help with emotional
and psychological needs. A support group
can also be a good source of practical
advice and helpful tips. People with
common ground can share information on
their experiences, financial and emotional
burdens, coping strategies, and knowledge
about research and treatments.

Things you can do to prepare for a second
opinion:


Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who aren’t part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Ask your doctors or supportive care team
about finding a lymphoma or cancer
support community. Support groups can
be found online and in-person groups are
often available in larger communities.

Compare benefits and downsides

Every option has benefits and downsides.
Consider both when deciding which option is
best for you. Talking to others can help identify
benefits and downsides you haven’t thought of.
Scoring each factor from 0 to 10 can also help
because some factors may be more important
to you than others.
