About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma, Version 2.2023 — March 9,
2023.

Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer
of the lymph nodes and the lymphatic system.
Most people are diagnosed between the ages
of 15 to 30, or after age 55. It is the most
common cancer in teenagers 15 to 19 years of
age. It is less common in children between the
ages of 5 and 14.

Hodgkin lymphoma basics » The lymphatic system

The lymphatic system

Spleen

The lymphatic system helps the body
fight infection and disease. It is part of the
immune system. The tissues and organs of
the lymphatic system are made mostly of
white blood cells called lymphocytes. There
are many other types of white blood cells,
but lymphocytes are the most important for
understanding Hodgkin lymphoma.

The spleen is the largest organ of the
lymphatic system. It is about 4 inches long
and shaped like a fist. Like lymph nodes, the
spleen contains lymphocytes that help the
body fight infection and disease. The spleen
also plays an important role in blood filtration
and storage.

Bone marrow

Lymph and lymphatic vessels
A super-highway of ducts, called lymphatic
vessels, runs through the body. Much like
how blood vessels transport blood, lymphatic
vessels transport lymph. Lymph is a clear fluid
made mostly of lymphocytes. It is also called
lymphatic fluid.

Most bones have soft, spongy tissue in the
center called bone marrow. This is where new
blood cells, including some lymphocytes, are
made. B lymphocytes (B cells), 1 of 2 main
types of lymphocytes, are made in the bone
marrow. The "B" in B cells stands for bone
marrow.

Lymph nodes

Thymus

While traveling throughout the body in
lymphatic vessels, lymph passes through
hundreds of small bean-shaped structures
called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes filter out
foreign particles, germs, and harmful cells,
including cancer cells. Lymph nodes can’t
usually be seen or felt. Certain areas of the
body contain more lymph nodes than others.
The highest numbers of lymph nodes are
found in the:

The thymus is a small organ in the upper
chest. Here, early lymphocytes develop into
T lymphocytes (T cells), the other main type
of lymphocyte. The "T" in T cells stands for
thymus.

Hodgkin lymphoma basics » Types of Hodgkin lymphoma

Types of Hodgkin lymphoma

NLPHL

CHL

Only about 1 in 20 people with Hodgkin
lymphoma have nodular lymphocyte
predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL).
This rare type is slow-growing. Over time, in
rare cases, NLPHL can become an aggressive
type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Most people diagnosed with Hodgkin
lymphoma have classic Hodgkin lymphoma
(CHL). There are 4 types of CHL:


Nodular sclerosis (most common)



Mixed cellularity



Lymphocyte-rich



Lymphocyte-depleted (least common)

While they are all considered CHL, they look
different under a microscope. They may also
behave differently. For example, some types
are more likely to cause symptoms than
others. The CHL treatment information in this
guide applies to all 4 subtypes.

Doctors can tell if a suspected cancer is Hodgkin lymphoma by looking at one or
more lymph nodes under a microscope. In CHL, abnormally large lymphocytes
called Reed-Sternberg cells can be seen. Experts don’t know why normal
lymphocytes turn into Reed-Sternberg cells.
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a large and varied group of lymphomas. They do not
have the distinctive Reed-Sternberg cells seen in Hodgkin lymphoma.
This book does not discuss treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Hodgkin lymphoma basics » Clinical trials

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Finding a clinical trial
In the United States

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Informed consent

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and benefits
of participating. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

treatment is explained.

Fever

Physical exam
Your doctor will review your health history and
perform a physical exam. Normally, lymph
nodes can’t be seen or felt. But Hodgkin
lymphoma can cause them to get bigger than
normal. Using their hands, your doctor will feel
the areas of the body where there are the most
lymph nodes. This includes the neck, armpits,
and groin. In addition to these areas, expect
your doctor to feel your spleen and liver.

Heavy night

Symptoms
Hodgkin lymphoma can cause symptoms.
There are 3 in particular that your doctor
should be aware of, if you have them. These
are called “B” symptoms. They include:

Testing for Hodgkin lymphoma » Lymph node biopsy » Blood tests

Lymph node biopsy

In the case of nodular lymphocyte-predominant
Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), a surface protein
called CD20 can usually be seen but CD15
and CD30 usually cannot.

A lymph node biopsy is needed to diagnose
Hodgkin lymphoma. Either an excisional or
incisional biopsy is preferred. In an excisional
biopsy, one or more whole lymph nodes are
removed and tested. In an incisional or “open”
biopsy, a small amount of lymph node tissue
is removed through a cut in the skin. These
procedures are usually done under general
anesthesia.

Blood tests
The blood tests typically done as part of testing
for Hodgkin lymphoma are described below.
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
number of red blood cells, white blood cells,
and platelets in a sample of blood.

While these types are preferred, a core needle
biopsy is sometimes performed. This type
involves the use of a wide needle to remove
a sample of tissue from a lymph node. The
lymph node itself is not removed. This can
often be done with local anesthesia or deep
sedation.

An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test
measures how quickly red blood cells settle at
the bottom of a test tube that contains a blood
sample. A higher-than-normal ESR may be a
sign of inflammation, infection, cancer, or other
diseases.

Another type of biopsy called a fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) should not be used alone
to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma. In an FNA,
a thin needle is used to remove a sample of
tissue from a lymph node. This is typically
done with a local anesthetic.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein made
by the liver when there is inflammation in the
body. A high level of CRP can be a sign of
infection, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or
heart problems.

Testing the removed node(s)

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a
group of more than 10 blood tests. It provides
information about the health of the kidneys,
liver, and other organs and tissues. It also
gives information on your blood sugar, calcium,
and electrolytes.

The removed lymph nodes are examined
under a microscope to look for the abnormally
large Reed-Sternberg cells that are seen in
classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL).
The tissue is also tested using a process
called immunohistochemistry. Using a
microscope, this test looks for proteins on
the surface of cells. A diagnosis can be made
based on the proteins that can be seen (and
not seen). For example, in CHL, proteins
called CD15 and CD30 can usually be seen on
the surface of Reed-Sternberg cells, while CD3
and CD45 usually cannot.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children, 2023

Before starting treatment, those who are able
to become pregnant should have a pregnancy
test. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) and for hepatitis B and C is encouraged,
especially if your doctor thinks you may be at
risk for these diseases.
Testing for immune system problems
(immunodeficiency) may be ordered for
children under the age of 5. It is often also
considered for those with:

how much is absorbed by the liver and the
mediastinum (the area between the lungs).
A Deauville score of 1 or 2 means that there
are no cancerous areas of concern. A score
of 4 or 5 generally means that there are
cancerous areas of concern. A score of 3 can
be considered good or bad, depending on the
situation.

A personal or family history of
immunodeficiency.

Imaging
PET

FDG-PET scans are used to determine the
cancer stage and to see how well treatment is
working. It is common to have more than one
FDG-PET scan during the course of treatment.
FDG-PET is often combined with either
computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging.

Positron emission tomography (PET)
scans use a small amount of radioactive
glucose (sugar), called a radiotracer.
Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is most often
used. The tracer gives off a small amount of
energy that is detected by the scanner. Areas
with cancer appear brighter (“hotter”) because
cancer cells use sugar more quickly than
normal cells.

CT and MRI
Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) are other important
imaging tests used for Hodgkin lymphoma. As
part of initial testing, it is common to have a
CT scan of the area from the neck to the groin.

A 5-point system, called the Deauville criteria,
is used to rate how much of the tracer is
absorbed by areas with cancer compared to

Imaging for Hodgkin
lymphoma
In addition to FDG-PET
scans, CT and MRI
are important imaging
tests used for Hodgkin
lymphoma. Contrast is
often given for CT and
MRI scans.

your beating heart on a screen. The pictures
are recorded for future viewing.

Or you may have a combination of a CT scan
and an MRI of separate areas of your body.
Depending on the type of PET/CT or PET/MRI
obtained in your workup, you may not need
separate CT and MRI scans.

If chemotherapy containing an anthracycline is
planned, an echocardiogram is recommended.
Doxorubicin is an anthracycline used in some
chemotherapy regimens used to treat Hodgkin
lymphoma.

CT takes many pictures of a body part from
different angles using x-rays. A computer
combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures.

Electrocardiogram

MRI uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of areas inside the body. It
does not use radiation. Because of the very
strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell
the technician if you have any metal in your
body.

An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) may
be helpful in some cases. This test shows
electrical changes in the heart. It reveals
information about heart rate and rhythm. For
this test, small patches are placed on the chest
to track the heartbeat.

Contrast

Lung function tests

Contrast is a substance put into the body that
makes imaging pictures clearer. It is often used
for CT and MRI scans. The contrast is put into
the bloodstream through a vein and may also
be given as a drink. Tell your care team if you
have had problems with contrast in the past.
Allergic reactions, such as throat swelling and
hives, are possible. You will be asked a series
of questions to make sure you are not allergic
to the contrast.

Bleomycin is a chemotherapy medicine
sometimes used (with other medicines) to
treat Hodgkin lymphoma in young people.
Bleomycin can damage the lungs. If treatment
that includes bleomycin is being considered,
lung function tests are recommended. The
3 most common lung function tests are
described below.


Heart and lung tests


Some cancer treatments can damage the
heart and lungs. In order to plan treatment,
your doctors will test how well your heart and
lungs work.

Echocardiogram



An echocardiogram uses sound waves to see
how well the heart is working. A technician
called a cardiac sonographer performs this
test. The technician slides a wand with gel on
its tip across your chest. They are able to view
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children, 2023

Spirometry measures the amount of
air the lungs can hold, and how fast you
can empty the air out of your lungs.
A gas diffusion test involves breathing
in a harmless gas and measuring how
much of it you breathe out. It tells how
much oxygen travels from your lungs into
your blood.
Body plethysmograph involves sitting
in a small room and breathing into a tube.
This test measures how much air your
lungs can hold and how much air is left in
your lungs after you exhale.

Testing for Hodgkin lymphoma » Other testing and care

Other testing and care
Fertility and pregnancy
Most young people will have chemotherapy
with a regimen that is unlikely to cause
infertility. But if you want the option of having
children after treatment or are unsure, tell
your care team. There are ways to preserve
your fertility. The most common methods are
described next.

If you smoke or vape, seek
help to quit
If you smoke or vape, it’s important
to quit. Smoking can limit how well
cancer treatment works. Smoking
and vaping can also increase the risk
of lung problems during and after
chemotherapy. It also increases your
chances of developing other cancers.

Sperm banking stores semen for later use by
freezing it in liquid nitrogen. The medical term
for this is semen cryopreservation.
Like sperm, unfertilized eggs can be removed,
frozen, and stored for later use. This is called
egg freezing or oocyte cryopreservation.
Ovarian tissue banking involves removing
part or all of an ovary and freezing the part
that contains the eggs. The frozen tissue
containing the eggs can later be unfrozen and
put back in the body.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco
that makes you want to keep smoking.
Nicotine withdrawal is challenging for
most people who smoke. The stress of
having cancer may make it even harder
to quit. If you smoke, ask your doctor
about counseling and medicines to help
you quit.

More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Vaccines
The influenza vaccine (the “flu shot”) is
recommended for everyone with Hodgkin
lymphoma, even during treatment.

Physical exam


If treating the spleen with radiation therapy is
planned, certain vaccines are recommended
before or after treatment. These include the
vaccines for pneumonia, meningitis, and
Haemophilus influenzae type B (“Hib” or
“H-flu”). Despite its name, H-flu does not cause
the common flu. It is a bacteria that can cause
pneumonia and other serious infections, such
as meningitis.



Your doctor will perform a full physical
exam including examining your neck,
armpits, and groin. These areas have the
most lymph nodes.
“B” symptoms include unexplained fevers
(not caused by infection), heavy night
sweats, and weight loss.

Biopsy


The COVID-19 vaccine can affect the
appearance of your lymph nodes on FDGPET, CT, and MRI scans. The lymph nodes
may appear "hotter" on PET and larger on CT
and MRI, usually on the side you received the
vaccine. It is important to tell your doctors and
imaging technicians that you have received
this vaccine.

A lymph node biopsy is needed to
diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma. Either
an excisional or incisional biopsy is
preferred.

Imaging


FDG-PET scans are used to determine
the cancer stage and to see how well
treatment is working. FDG-PET is often
combined with either CT or MRI.

Heart and lung testing

Bone marrow biopsy



In general, bone marrow biopsies are no
longer included in the testing for Hodgkin
lymphoma. But if you have lower-than-normal
numbers of blood cells on complete blood
count (CBC) and a PET scan doesn’t suggest
there is cancer in the bone marrow, a bone
marrow biopsy may be needed.

If chemotherapy with an anthracycline
(such as doxorubicin) is planned, an
echocardiogram is recommended.

Staging » Overview and stages

Before starting treatment, it is
important to determine how far the
cancer has spread. This process
is called staging.

Let us know what
you think!

Overview and stages

Please take a moment to
complete an online survey
about the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients.

The results of the physical exam and imaging
tests are used to assign the stage.
Hodgkin lymphoma usually starts in the upper
body, often in lymph nodes in the neck, chest,
or armpits. The diaphragm is a thin muscle
below the lungs and heart. It can be thought
of as a dividing line between the chest and
the abdomen. Hodgkin lymphoma is staged in
part depending on whether cancer has spread
to lymph nodes or other areas below the
diaphragm.

NCCN.org/patients/response

There are 4 stages: I (1), II (2), III (3), and IV
(4). One or more of the following letters may
accompany the stage. They provide further
information about the cancer.








A – The cancer is asymptomatic (not
causing "B" symptoms).
B – There are B symptoms, such as
fevers, night sweats, and weight loss.
X –The lymph nodes with cancer are
bulky (large).
E – Cancer cells have invaded the nonlymphatic tissue next to or surrounding
the lymph nodes. This is called an
extralymphatic lesion or “e-lesion.”

The cancer stage describes the extent of
cancer in the body.
The physical exam and imaging results
are used to determine the stage.

The power of support

Hodgkin lymphoma usually starts in lymph
nodes in the neck, chest, or armpits.

Seek out support groups at your treatment
center, through social media, or from the
resources listed in the back of this book.
Look to friends, relatives, neighbors,
and co-workers for social support. Many
people find support groups helpful
even after treatment is over. It can help
with anxiety about cancer returning
(recurrence).

The cancer is staged based in part on
whether it has spread to lymph nodes
or other areas above or below the
diaphragm.
There are 4 stages: I (1), II (2), III (3), and
IV (4).
One or more letters providing extra
information may accompany the stage.

therapy may follow chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the most effective and widely
used treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a
type of systemic therapy. Systemic therapy is
the use of medicine to kill cancer cells.

Features seen in one person with Hodgkin
lymphoma may not be seen in another with
the same diagnosis. Over time, doctors have
found that cancers with certain features need
more intensive treatment. These features
include:








Most chemotherapies are liquids that are
slowly injected into a vein. This process
is called infusion. The drugs travel in the
bloodstream to treat cancer throughout the
body. Chemotherapy harms healthy cells in
addition to cancer cells. This is why it can
cause harsh side effects.

B symptoms (fevers, night sweats, weight
loss)
Bulky (large) lymph nodes with cancer

Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment
days followed by days of rest. This allows the
body to recover between cycles. Cycles vary in
length depending on which drugs are used.

Cancer outside of lymph nodes (higher
stage cancer)
Cancer in more than 1 group of lymph
nodes

Brentuximab vedotin

Blood tests signaling inflammation

Initial chemotherapy for high-risk CHL may
include brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris). This
antibody therapy combines 2 drugs in one. The
antibody component (brentuximab) finds and
attaches to cancer cells that have the CD30
protein on their surface, such as abnormally
large Reed-Sternberg cells seen in CHL. Once
attached, a chemotherapy drug is released
into the cancer cell. By targeting only cells
with CD30 receptors, fewer normal cells are
harmed.

Treatment is based on whether the cancer
has any of the above features. There are 3
risk groups: low, medium, and high. Tailoring
the amount of chemotherapy according to risk
group helps those with higher-stage cancer do
just as well as those with lower-stage cancer.
At this time, there isn’t one system that all
doctors use to assign the cancer a risk group.
And, risk grouping is always changing as new
data become available. Ask your doctor which
risk group applies to your cancer.

Radiation therapy

Regardless of risk level, seeking
treatment within a clinical trial is
strongly encouraged. Ask your care

Radiation therapy may be given after initial
chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. Using
high-energy x-rays (photons), electrons, or
27

Treatment for classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) » Treatments

protons, radiation therapy kills existing cancer
cells or stops new cancer cells from being
made.

Radiation therapy

If radiation therapy is needed, involvedsite radiation therapy (ISRT) is often
recommended. This type of external radiation
therapy targets the lymph nodes in which the
cancer started and nearby areas of cancer.

Radiation therapy may be given after
chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma.
A type of external radiation therapy called
involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT) targets
the lymph nodes where the cancer started
and nearby areas of cancer.

A simulation session will be performed before
treatment with radiation therapy starts.
Pictures of the tumor will be taken, usually
using a CT scan in the radiation treatment
position. The pictures are used to determine
the details of your treatment. You may be
asked to hold your breath during the simulation
scan or treatment to keep your heart and lungs
from moving.
During treatment, you will lie on a table in the
same position as done for simulation. A mesh
mask, body mold, or other devices may be
used to keep you from moving. You will be
alone while the therapists operate the machine
from a nearby control room.
Proton therapy
Proton therapy is a newer type of particlebased radiation therapy. It may reduce late
side effects caused by treatment with radiation,
such as heart disease and second cancers.
This is especially true for younger people with
lymphoma in the area between the lungs. If
treatment with radiation therapy is planned,
young people with Hodgkin lymphoma or their
caregivers are encouraged to ask if proton
therapy is right for them.

Treatment for classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) » Low-risk CHL

Low-risk CHL
Low-risk CHL includes non-bulky stage 1A
and 2A cancers, and some stage 1B cancers.
The cancer is contained within the nodes.
When cancer cells grow beyond a lymph
node into nearby non-lymphatic tissue, it is
called an extralymphatic lesion or e-lesion. To
be considered low-risk CHL, the cancer must
not be bulky or have e-lesions.

Side effects
Managing side effects is a shared
effort between you and your care
team. It is important to speak up about
bothersome side effects, such as
nausea and vomiting. Ask about your
options for managing or relieving the
effects of treatment.

Preferred treatment options
If a clinical trial is not available or otherwise
not an option, chemotherapy with the OEPA
regimen is preferred. The medicines included
in this regimen are listed in Guide 1 on page
32.

More information on nausea and
vomiting is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Treatment involves 2 cycles of OEPA. When
complete, you will have a PET scan to see
how well the treatment worked. The cancer will
be designated as being either fast or slow to
respond. If the cancer is designated as slow
to respond, radiation therapy is recommended
after chemotherapy.
If the response to chemotherapy is good, no
further treatment is needed.

Other recommended options
For a small number of young people with CHL,
the ABVD regimen may be considered. This
regimen is usually used for adults. It is more
toxic than regimens typically recommended
for young people. It also has lower rates of
success.

Treatment for classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) » When treatment is over

When treatment is over
Hodgkin lymphoma and its treatment can
cause serious health problems many years
later. It is important to maintain a relationship
with an oncologist who understands the health
risks faced by Hodgkin lymphoma survivors.
The recommended follow-up care after
treatment is explained below.

Good to know
There isn’t a “one-size-fits-all” care plan
that all Hodgkin lymphoma survivors
should follow after treatment. The types
of follow-up tests you should have—and
how often you should have them—
should be based on your specific cancer
circumstances. This includes:

Physical exams
Physical exams are an important part of followup care. They are given more often in the
years right after treatment, and then spaced
farther apart in later years.

3 Your age
3 The cancer stage when you were
diagnosed

First 1 to 2 years: Every 3 to 4 months

3 Your social habits
3 Your treatment history

Until year 3: Every 6 to 12 months
Years 4 and 5: Once per year

Blood tests
There isn’t a schedule for blood tests in the
first few years after treatment. Your doctor may
order bloodwork at the time of your physical
exams, or only if relapse is suspected.

Your doctor may order an echocardiogram
(heart ultrasound) when treatment is over.
The goal is to get a baseline (starting)
measurement of your heart health. The testing
may then be repeated according to your risk of
heart problems.

Recommended tests include a complete
blood count (CBC), chemistry profile, and
either erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or
C-reactive protein (CRP).

Imaging tests

If you had radiation therapy to the neck, a
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is
recommended at least once a year.

There isn’t a schedule for imaging after
treatment. Your doctor will order imaging if
you develop symptoms or if there are other
possible signs of relapse, but no routine
imaging is needed. If relapse is suspected, you
may have a chest x-ray, CT with contrast, or
MRI of all original areas of cancer.

Heart and lung tests
You may have lung function tests after
treatment. Your doctor will consider this testing
if chemotherapy included the drug bleomycin,
or if the lungs were treated with radiation.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children, 2023

If your most recent FDG-PET scan was a
Deauville score of 3, 4, or 5, either an FDG-

33

Treatment for classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) » When treatment is over

PET/CT or PET/MRI scan is recommended
when all treatment (including radiation therapy)
is over. This is to make sure that no cancer
can be detected. But having FDG-PET scans
on a regular basis to monitor for the return of
Hodgkin lymphoma is not recommended.

Survivorship

Vaccines

Second cancers
Anyone who has had Hodgkin lymphoma is
at risk of getting other types of cancer. This is
especially true if radiation therapy was used
as part of initial treatment. These “secondary
cancers” often occur more than 10 years after
treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.

Side effects of Hodgkin lymphoma and its
treatment can start years after treatment.
These are called “late” side effects. The most
serious late effects that Hodgkin survivors
experience are described below.

Everyone should continue to get the influenza
vaccine (the “flu shot”) every year, and other
vaccines as needed. If the spleen was treated
with radiation therapy, certain vaccines are
recommended after treatment. These include
the vaccines for pneumonia, meningitis,
and Haemophilus influenzae type B (“Hib”
or “H-flu”). Continue to let your doctors and
imaging technologists know if you have had a
COVID-19 vaccine prior to any imaging.

Thyroid cancer and breast cancer are the
most common secondary cancers diagnosed
in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors. Skin cancers
can also occur in areas treated with radiation.

Survivorship counseling
Hodgkin lymphoma survivors
are encouraged to undergo
counseling on survivorship,
including long-term
treatment effects, preventing
new cancers, and healthy
behaviors. Ask your doctor
about survivorship clinics
near you.

Thyroid problems
The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland
in the front of the neck. About half of Hodgkin
lymphoma survivors who had radiation therapy
to the neck or upper chest have thyroid
problems later in life. The most common
problem is hypothyroidism, in which the thyroid
gland doesn’t make enough thyroid hormone.

Weight gain, constipation, dry skin, and
sensitivity to cold temperatures are symptoms

Heart disease
Hodgkin lymphoma survivors have a higher
long-term risk of diseases that affect the heart
or blood vessels. This is called heart disease
or cardiovascular disease. Symptoms of heart
disease can start at any age, but damage
to the heart or blood vessels is usually
found more than 5 to 10 years after finishing
treatment.

disease in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors are:

encouraged. Your doctor should also refer
you to a specialized cancer center or consult
closely with a center with expertise in Hodgkin
lymphoma.

Most young people with Hodgkin lymphoma
stay cancer-free after treatment. But about 1
in 10 will experience a relapse, or the return of
cancer.

If a clinical trial is not available, relapsed CHL
is usually treated with chemotherapy first.
Immunotherapy may also be used, either by
itself or with chemotherapy. When used to
treat relapse, systemic therapy is called reinduction therapy. Currently recommended
regimens are listed in Guide 2.

If a relapse is suspected, a biopsy is needed
to confirm areas of suspected cancer before
starting treatment. This allows your doctor to
see what is in the tumor and plan treatment
accordingly. If confirmed, enrollment in
a clinical trial for treatment is strongly

Immunotherapy

The goal is to achieve a complete response to
re-induction therapy. This means that no cancer
can be detected. Chemotherapy with more than
one re-induction regimen may be needed to
get a complete response. If achieved, a stem
cell transplant is usually recommended next
for those that relapse within the first year after
the end of treatment. More information on this
procedure is provided below. Radiation therapy
may follow the transplant.

If the cancer returns after treatment with at
least 2 different chemotherapy regimens,
and immunotherapy has not yet been used,
treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor
should be strongly considered.
Examples include nivolumab (Opdivo) and
pembrolizumab (Keytruda). Checkpoint inhibitors
work by increasing the activity of the immune
system. This improves the body’s ability to find
and destroy cancer cells.

For some very-low-risk cases of relapse, it may
be possible to avoid a stem cell transplant.
Treatment with re-induction therapy and
radiation therapy may be given instead. Avoiding
a stem cell transplant may be possible if:

High-dose chemotherapy with
stem cell rescue

You do not have B symptoms (fevers, night
sweats, weight loss).

After re-induction therapy and either stem cell
transplant and/or radiation therapy, your doctor
will order an FDG-PET scan to check the
results. If no cancer can be seen, observation
will start. You will have a follow-up exam shortly
thereafter. If the FDG-PET scan shows areas of
cancer, more systemic therapy is recommended.
Options to try next are listed in Guide 2.

High-dose chemotherapy may be used to treat
relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.
Refractory means that the cancer was not cured
with initial treatment. Relapsed means that the
cancer returned after successful treatment.
Such high doses of chemotherapy can damage
or destroy hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem
cells, which are found in the bone marrow.
When damaged, they may not form the blood
cells needed by the body. To protect your
blood-forming stem cells from high-dose
chemotherapy, some stem cells are removed
from your blood weeks or months before this
treatment is started. They are stored in a lab.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children, 2023

37

Treatment for classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) » Relapse

After the high-dose chemotherapy regimen
has been completed, your bone marrow will be
"rescued" by giving back your healthy stem cells.
The transplanted stem cells will form new red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This
will restore your body’s ability to protect itself
from infection. It will also helps prevent bleeding.

The stem cell rescue process
The first step is to increase the number of stem
cells in the blood. This is known as mobilization.
Medicines are used to cause stem cells to move
from the bone marrow into the blood. When your
doctor determines that your stem cell count is
high enough, the next step is collection.

A number of names are used to refer to this
procedure, including:

A process called apheresis is used to collect
the stem cells from blood. Your blood will
be removed from a large vein, most likely in
your arm. It will flow through a tube and into
a machine that removes stem cells. The rest
of your blood will be returned to you in your
other arm. Apheresis typically takes around 4
to 6 hours and does not require anesthesia. It

High-dose chemotherapy may be used to treat relapsed or refractory cancer. To protect

weeks or months beforehand. When high-dose chemotherapy is over, your bone marrow is
"rescued" by giving back your healthy stem cells.

Early-stage NLPHL

NLPHL is a rare type of Hodgkin
lymphoma. It is usually very small

Most people have early-stage NLPHL at the
time of diagnosis. Early-stage NLPHL includes
stages 1A and 2A. Most of these tumors are
small (not bulky). The following information
applies to non-bulky stage 1A or 2A NLPHL.
The letter A after the stage means that the
cancer is not causing "B" symptoms.

and treatable when found. But
its treatment can cause late side
effects. Long-term follow-up is
essential.

Surgery to remove the cancer is
recommended. A positron emission
tomography/computed tomography (PET/
CT) scan is done afterward to learn if all of
the cancer was removed. Further treatment, if
needed, depends on the results of surgery.

Unlike classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL), most
people with NLPHL have had a lymph node
growing for several (more than 2) years. They
also don't usually have fevers, night sweats,
or weight loss. In young people, NLPHL also
tends to be found at an earlier age than CHL
and more often in those assigned male sex at
birth.

Complete resection
If the results of surgery are very good, it is
called complete resection. After complete
resection, there are 2 preferred options for
next steps. The first is enrolling in an ongoing
clinical trial. The other is observation.

The chemotherapy regimens used for earlystage CHL are also used for NLPHL. These
regimens work well but often overtreat the
disease. The chemotherapy and possibly
radiation therapy used can cause side effects
years later, including other cancers. NLPHL
can also transform into a fast-growing type of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma called diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma.

Observation involves monitoring the original
cancer site with imaging. An ultrasound is
recommended every 3 to 4 months for the first
2 years after surgery. Two out of 3 people with
NLPHL will be cured with surgery alone.
While observation alone is preferred for those
with a complete resection, chemotherapy is
also an option. If chemotherapy is planned, 3
cycles of the CVbP regimen is recommended.
Rituximab may be added. The medicines
included in the CVbP regimen are listed in
Guide 3 on the next page.

An antibody therapy called rituximab (Rituxan)
is sometimes added to chemotherapy to treat
NLPHL. Rituximab targets and attaches to a
protein found on the surface of NLPHL cells
(and some healthy blood cells). This helps the
immune system find and attack the cancer
cells.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children, 2023

For those above 18 years of age, regimens
normally used for adults with Hodgkin
lymphoma may be considered instead of
CVbP.

Incomplete resection

Guide 3
Systemic therapy for NLPHL

Sometimes the cancer cannot be fully removed
during surgery. This is called incomplete
resection. The following information applies to
those with non-bulky stage 1A or 2A cancer
that was incompletely resected.
There are 2 preferred options. The first is
enrolling in an ongoing trial. If a clinical trial
is not available or otherwise not an option,
chemotherapy is recommended. Three cycles
of one of the below regimens is preferred.

The medicines included in these regimens are

If the cancer responds well to chemotherapy,
no further treatment is needed. Follow-up care
will begin.
If cancer remains after 3 cycles of
chemotherapy, radiation therapy is
recommended. Or you may be referred to a
specialty center for further treatment.
Other recommended options
Another recommended option is 2 cycles of
OEPA chemotherapy. If cancer remains after 2
cycles, radiation therapy is recommended. Or
you may be referred to a specialty center for
further treatment.
For patients above 18 years of age, regimens
normally used for adults with Hodgkin
lymphoma may also be considered.

Advanced NLPHL

Key points

The stages listed below are considered
advanced.


Bulky stage 1A and 2A



Stage 1B and 2B



Stage 3



Stage 4



NLPHL is a rare type of Hodgkin
lymphoma. It is usually small and
treatable when found.

Early-stage NLPHL


Advanced-stage NLPHL is very rare in
young people. If advanced disease is
suspected, a double-check of the diagnosis is
recommended. An expert pathologist should
review the original tissue samples to confirm
that the cancer is NLPHL.





If confirmed, treatment at a specialty cancer
center is recommended when possible. Due
to a lack of data, advanced NLPHL is often
treated similarly to classic Hodgkin lymphoma.


Follow-up care
The same follow-up care that is recommended
for classic Hodgkin lymphoma is also
recommended for NLPHL. See page 33 for
more information.

Surgery is the recommended first
treatment for early-stage NLPHL. If the
results are very good, it is called complete
resection.
After complete resection, observation or
a clinical trial are preferred options. CVbP
chemotherapy is also a recommended
option.
After incomplete resection, preferred
options are a clinical trial and either
AVPC or CVbP chemotherapy. OEPA
chemotherapy is also a recommended
option.
If cancer remains after chemotherapy with
AVPC, CVbP, or OEPA, radiation therapy
is recommended.

Advanced NLPHL






Advanced NLPHL is very rare in young
people. The diagnosis should be
confirmed.
Treatment at a specialty cancer center is
recommended for advanced NLPHL when
possible.
Due to a lack of data, advanced NLPHL
is often treated much like classic Hodgkin
lymphoma.

Making treatment decisions » It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable

If you take the time to build a relationship with
your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. It will not upset
your treatment team. Even doctors get second
opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.


Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects






Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups
Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, check out the websites listed in this
book.

Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life and length of life
How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Questions to ask

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children, 2023

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.

Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment.
