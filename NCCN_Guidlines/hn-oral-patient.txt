About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Head and Neck Cancers Version 1.2024 – October 9, 2023.

Mouth cancer basics » The mouth

Mouth or oral cavity cancer is a



type of cancer that affects the lips,
the front two-thirds of the tongue,



the gums, the lining inside the



cheeks and lips, the floor (bottom)
of the mouth under the tongue,



the hard palate (bony top of the
mouth), the bony ridges that hold
the sockets of the teeth, and the



small area of the gum behind the
wisdom teeth.



Buccal (oral) mucosa is the lining
inside the cheeks and inside where the
lips touch the teeth.
Alveolar ridge is the bony, raised
area of the upper (maxilla) and lower
(mandible) jaw that holds the sockets of
the teeth.
Gums (gingiva) surround the base of
the teeth and help keep them in place.

Retromolar trigone is the small area
behind the wisdom teeth.

The oral mucosa is the mucous membrane
lining the inside of the mouth and lips.

The mouth, or oral cavity, is the first part of the
digestive and respiratory (breathing) systems.
The lips, cheeks, palate, teeth, and tongue
make up the mouth. The mouth helps us
breathe, talk, chew, taste, swallow, eat, and
drink. The cheeks and lips hold food in the
mouth and help to form and sound words.

It is made up of 2 layers.
1. Epithelium – The surface layer containing
stratified squamous cells, which are thin,
flat cells.
2. Lamina propria – The bottom layer of
connective tissue.

Parts of the mouth
The 2 main functions of the mouth are eating
and speaking. The mouth is also known as the
oral cavity or the buccal cavity.

A tumor can grow through the layers of the oral
mucosa. A measure of how deep the tumor
has grown is called depth of invasion (DOI).

Some important structures of the mouth:

Depending on the region of the mouth,
the epithelium may be nonkeratinized or
keratinized. Nonkeratinized squamous
epithelium covers the soft palate, inner lips,
inner cheeks, the floor of the mouth, and area
underneath the tongue. Keratinized squamous

Hard palate is the hard, bony part of the
roof of the mouth.

epithelium is present on rough surfaces caused
by chewing such as the gums (gingiva) and
hard palate as well as the top of the tongue.

It is strongly recommended,
when possible, for those with
head and neck cancers to be
treated at a high-volume center
or hospital that has experience
in their type of cancer.

Head and neck cancer
Head and neck cancer is a group of cancers
that arise in the head or neck area of the body.
Cancer is named and treated based on the
tumor location or where the cancer started.

Mouth (oral cavity),

Cancer that occurs on the inside of the mouth
is also called oral cancer or oral cavity cancer.
Mouth cancer is one of several types of cancers
grouped into a category called head and neck
cancers. Mouth cancer and other head and
neck cancers are often treated similarly.

Middle part of the throat near the mouth
(oropharynx),
Space behind the nose (nasal cavity and
paranasal sinuses),
Upper part of the throat near the nasal
cavity (nasopharynx),

Mouth cancer starts in the squamous cells that
form the surface lining of the mouth. Normally,
these are thin, flat cells and are similar to
the top layer of skin and surface lining some
other parts of the body such as the lungs and
esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
is the most common type of mouth cancer and
is the focus of this book.

Voice box (larynx), or
Lower part of the throat near the voice
box (hypopharynx).

More information on nasopharyngeal cancer
(NPC) and throat (oropharyngeal) cancer can
be found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Mouth cancer can develop in the parts that
make up the mouth such as:

Mouth cancer refers to cancer that
develops in any of the parts that make up
the mouth (oral cavity). Mouth cancer is a
type of head and neck cancer.
Head and neck cancers are a group of
cancers that arise in the head or neck
area of the body.
Cancer treatment is based on the tumor
location and cancer stage.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the
most common type of mouth cancer. It
forms in the thin, flat cells of the mucous
membranes of the mouth. SCC is the
focus of this book.

these findings. It is important you understand
what these tests mean. Ask questions and
keep copies of your test results. Online patient
portals are a great way to access your test
results. Please discuss your results with your
health care provider.

during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.
Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.
Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.
Keep a list of contact information for

In your contact list, include information on
the exact type of cancer you have, as well
as any treatments you've received and
the date each treatment started.
Set up a “MyChart” or health record
account if it’s available, which will
help you track your appointments and
communicate with your care team.

Family history
In general, head and neck cancers are
not inherited from your biological parents.
However, some cancers and other diseases
can run in families. Your care team will ask
about the health history of family members
who are blood relatives. This information is
called a family history. Ask family members
on both sides of your family about their
health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were

diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific
type of cancer or where the cancer started, if it
is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic
testing.

mirror or fiberoptic scope to look at these
areas.

Tobacco and alcohol use history

It is important to tell your dentist about your
head and neck cancer and to have regular
dental cleanings and checkups. Head and
neck cancer and its treatment can affect the
health of your jaw, teeth, and gums. If you
need any dental work or procedures, it might
be recommended before starting certain
treatments.

Dental exam

Tobacco and alcohol use are known risk
factors for developing head and neck cancer
and can limit how well treatment works. It can
affect survival. You will be asked about your
tobacco and alcohol use history and asked
to avoid tobacco and limit alcohol use during
treatment. Speak to your care team if you have
any questions or concerns.

Distress screening
It is normal to have strong feelings about being
diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can
also change from day to day and week to
week. Talk to your care team and those whom
you feel most comfortable about how you are
feeling. There are services and people who
can help you. Support and counseling are
available. Many treatment teams include mind
and body therapists who can help.

Physical exam
During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:


Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat





Dealing with a cancer diagnosis can be
stressful and may cause further distress.
Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You
may also experience depression, anxiety, and
sleep issues. Your treatment team will screen
your level of distress. This is part of your
cancer care.

Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.
Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

Complete head and neck exam
A physical exam will include the head and
neck. Since some parts of the mouth and
throat are not easy to see when you open
your mouth, a health care provider might feel

Endocrine tests

choosing a treatment plan. Your preferences
about treatment are always important.

Radiation therapy to the head and neck can
affect endocrine (hormone) glands found in the
head and neck, such as thyroid and pituitary
glands. Therefore, blood tests to look at thyroid
endocrine levels might be done before and/or
after treatment.

Fertility (all genders)
Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect
your fertility, the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might change your fertility. To preserve your
fertility, you may need to take action before
starting cancer treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options
before starting treatment.

Hearing test
A hearing test shows if there is any hearing
loss, and if so, the type of hearing loss, how
severe it is, and what might have caused it. An
audiogram is a graph showing the results of a
pure-tone hearing test. Tumors in the head and
neck can affect hearing. Treatment of head
and neck tumors can also affect hearing.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t really sure
at the moment. Fertility and
reproductive specialists
can help you sort through
what may be best for your
situation.

Nutrition assessment
You might meet with a nutrition expert before
starting treatment. A nutritionist or dietitian
can suggest the best foods and fluids for you.
It is important that you receive adequate and
sustained nutrition before you start treatment.

More information on fertility
preservation in adolescents
and young adults is available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Speech and swallowing
assessment
You might visit with a speech or swallowing
therapist who will test your ability to swallow
and speak before and after treatment.

Changes in fertility

Performance status

Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
self-care tasks. Your state of general health
will be rated using a PS scale called Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). PS

Testing for mouth cancer » Preventing pregnancy during treatment

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment
Preventing pregnancy during treatment is
important. Cancer and cancer treatment
can affect the ovaries and damage sperm.
Hormonal birth control may or may not be
recommended, so ask your doctor about
options such as intrauterine devices (IUDs)
and barrier methods. Types of barrier methods
include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps,
and the contraceptive sponge.

Testing for mouth cancer » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

look for cancer. In most cases, contrast will be
used.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your
body. Imaging tests show the primary tumor, or
where the cancer started, and look for cancer
in other parts of the body. A radiologist, an
expert in interpreting imaging tests, will write a
report and send this report to your health care
provider (HCP). It is likely that the report will be
sent directly to you through your patient portal
or patient access system. You should discuss
these results with your HCP. You will not have
all of the following tests.

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

Contrast material

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that help
enhance and improve the images of several
organs and structures in the body. It is used to
make the pictures clearer. The contrast is not
permanent and will leave your body in your
urine immediately after the test. The types of
contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI.

PET scan

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body to
grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on
PET scans. However, not all tumors will appear
on a PET scan. Also, not all bright spots are
cancer. It is normal for the brain, base
of the tongue or tonsil lymphoid
tissue, heart, kidneys, and bladder to
be bright on PET. Inflammation or infection
can also show up as a bright spot. When a
PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a
PET/CT scan.

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your head,
neck, and chest, may be one of the tests to
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mouth Cancer, 2024

14

Testing for mouth cancer » Imaging tests

FDG-PET/CT
An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made of
fluoride and a simple form of sugar called
glucose. You cannot eat or drink for at least
4 hours before the scan. This scan is most
helpful when other imaging results are unclear.
It may help find cancer in lymph nodes and
distant sites. If it clearly shows cancer in the
bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride PET/
CT may not be needed. FDG-PET/CT can
be done at the same time as a CT used for
diagnosis.

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit
A history of smoking or vaping nicotine
increases your chances of developing
head and neck, lung, and other cancers.
Smoking and vaping can limit how well
cancer treatment works and prevent
wound healing. They also greatly increase
your chances of having side effects during
and after surgery. Cannabis use might
also affect the amount of anesthesia used
during surgery.

Ultrasound
Ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer)
will be held and moved on your neck using
gel. Ultrasound is painless and does not use
x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed.
Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of
cancer that are near the skin. Sometimes, an
ultrasound or CT is used to guide a biopsy.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that
makes you want to keep smoking and
vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging
for most people who smoke or vape. The
stress of having cancer may make it even
harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask
your care team about counseling and
medicines to help you quit. In head and
neck cancers, stopping smoking or vaping
is essential to maximize the chance for
cure and minimize side effects.

Panoramic dental x-ray
A panoramic dental x-ray or panoramic x-ray
(Panorex) uses a very small dose of radiation
to capture the entire mouth in one image,
including the teeth, upper and lower jaws,
and surrounding structures and tissues. It
is commonly performed by dentists and oral
surgeons in everyday practice and may be
used to plan treatment for dentures, braces,
extractions, and implants.

Testing for mouth cancer » Biopsy » Biomarker testing

Biopsy

Biomarker testing

A biopsy removes a sample of tissue or fluid.
Samples removed during a biopsy or surgery
will be sent to a pathologist, an expert in
examining cells using a microscope (called
cytology) to confirm the presence of cancer.
The pathologist will determine the cancer
subtype called tumor histology.

Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total
of 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome
contains thousands of genes. Genes are
coded instructions for the proteins your cells
make. Most genes contain information about a
specific protein. A mutation is when something
goes wrong in the genetic code.

A fine-needle aspiration (FNA), fine needle
biopsy (FNB), and core needle biopsy (CNB)
use needles of different sizes to remove a
sample of tumor or lymph node. An ultrasound
or CT scan might be used to guide a lymph
node biopsy.

Biomarker tumor testing includes tests of
genes or their products (proteins). It identifies
the presence or absence of mutations and
certain proteins that might suggest treatment.
This information may be helpful when
choosing the best treatment for you. It is
sometimes called molecular testing or tumor
profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression
profiling, or genomic testing. These tests are
generally used in advanced or widely spread
(metastatic) cancers. However, in comparison
to other cancers, molecular testing has limited
value in the treatment of mouth cancers since
there are few drugs that specifically target the
genetic mutations causing mouth cancers to
grow and spread.

Biopsy of metastasis
Metastasis is the spread of cancer to an area
of the body such as lymph nodes or lung. A
biopsy of the metastasis may be needed to
confirm the presence of cancer. If there is
more than one metastasis, each site may be
biopsied. The type of biopsy used depends on
the location of the suspected metastases and
other factors.

MSI-H/dMMR mutation
Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of
DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are
fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.
Some cancers have DNA mutations or
changes that prevent these errors from being
fixed. This is called microsatellite instability
(MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).
When cancer cells have more than a normal
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mouth Cancer, 2024

Testing for mouth cancer » Biomarker testing

Tumor mutation testing

number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H
(microsatellite instability-high). This is often
due to dMMR genes.

Tumor mutation testing or tumor genomic
aberration testing uses a sample of your tumor
or blood to see if the cancer cells have any
specific DNA mutations. This is a different type
of DNA testing than the genetic testing for
mutations you may have inherited from your
biological parents. In tumor mutation testing,
only the tumor is tested and not the rest of
your body. Some mutations can be targeted
with specific therapies.

PD-L1 testing
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an
immune protein. If this protein is expressed
on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause
your immune cells to ignore the cancer and
suppress the anti-tumor immune response.
This is designed to activate your immune
system to better fight off the cancer cells. PDL1 expression is measured using a combined
positive score (CPS), which measures the
immune proteins in your tumor and your
immune system. If your cancer expresses this
protein and has a CPS of at least 1 percent
(1%) or higher, you might have treatment

Tumor mutational burden
When there are 10 or more mutations per
million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H).
Metastatic or unresectable TMB cancers
are often treated using immune checkpoint
inhibitors that target the proteins called
programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).

How mouth cancer is
staged

The extent (size) of the tumor (T):
How large is the cancer? Has it grown
into nearby areas?
The spread to nearby lymph nodes
(N): Has the cancer spread to nearby
lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where?
The spread (metastasis) to distant
sites (M): Has the cancer spread to
distant organs such as the lungs or liver?
Biomarker testing: Does the cancer
have any genes or mutations that might
suggest treatment?

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins. Doctors may
explain your cancer stage in different ways
than described next.

A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging.

Staging includes:


Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A
prognosis is the course your cancer will likely
take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.



Anatomic – based on extent of cancer
as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node
status (N), and distant metastasis (M).
Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM.
The prognostic stage also includes the
assumption that you are treated with the
standard-of-care approaches.

Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and
pathologic. Cancer staging is often done twice,
before and after surgery. Staging after surgery
provides more specific and accurate details
about the size of the cancer and lymph node
status.

“

Clinical stage
Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before
any treatment. It is based on a physical exam,
biopsy, and imaging tests. An example might
look like cN1 or cM1. In mouth cancer, the
clinical stage is based on imaging and biopsy
results. These tests are done before any
treatment as part of an initial diagnosis.

Anyone can give up; It’s the
easiest thing in the world to
do, but to hold it together when
everyone would expect for you
to fall apart, now that is true
strength.”

Pathologic stage
Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is
determined by examining tissue removed
during surgery. An example might be pN2.
If you are given cancer drug therapy before
surgery, then the stage might add a "y" and
look like ypT3.

Mouth cancer staging » TNM scores

TNM scores



The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage mouth cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different
areas of cancer growth. Based on imaging
and pathology results, a score or number is
assigned to each letter. The higher the number,
the larger the tumor or the more the cancer
has spread. These scores will be combined
to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM example
might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M0.










T (tumor) – Depth and size of the
main (primary) tumor and if the tumor
has grown into nearby tissue (tumor
extension).

Metastatic – This is cancer that
has spread to other parts of the body,
including lung and distant lymph
nodes. This might be referred to as
very advanced disease. Not all stage 4
cancers are metastatic.

Your preferences about treatment are
always important. Talk to your care
team and make your wishes known.

M (metastasis) -– If cancer has
spread to distant parts of the body or
metastasized

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with 4
being the most advanced. They might also be
written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III,
and stage IV.
Other terms might be used instead of
numbered cancer stages.



Moderately or very advanced
disease – This includes cancer that has
spread to parts of the neck such as the
bones and muscles of the jaw, sinuses, or
skin. It might include cancer in the base of
the skull or carotid artery.

N (node) – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes

Numbered stages



Locoregional or locally advanced –
This refers to a tumor that has spread to
tissue, organs, or lymph nodes near the
mouth.

Resectable – Tumor can be removed
completely with surgery.
Unresectable – Tumor cannot be
removed completely with surgery. The
tumor might involve major vessels or
other normal critical structures making it
unsafe to remove.

Those with head and neck cancer should seek
treatment at experienced cancer centers.



Treating cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementation of your treatment. Ask who will

Surgery

A certified lymphedema therapist
gives a type of massage called manual
lymph drainage.

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. When preparing
for surgery, you should seek the opinion of an
experienced otolaryngologist, head and neck
surgeon, or surgical oncologist with expertise
in head and neck cancer. The surgeon should
be an expert in performing your type of
surgery. Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating your type of cancer.

Speech-language and swallowing
therapists help people who have
trouble speaking or swallowing.
Psychologists and psychiatrists
are mental health experts who can help
manage issues such as depression,
anxiety, or other mental health conditions
that can affect how you think and feel.
Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional issues. The anxiety a
person feels when diagnosed with cancer
might be managed by a social worker
in some cancer centers. They, or other
designated professionals, can help
navigate the complexities of financial and
insurance stresses.

The removal of the cancer through surgery can
be accomplished in different ways depending
on the specific circumstances, such as the
size and location of the tumor, whether there is
cancer in any surrounding organs and tissues,
and your unique anatomy. Surgery is based on
the safest and best way to remove cancer.
When planning for surgery, you should ask
how your breathing, swallowing, speaking,
chewing, and appearance might be affected.
Sometimes nerves might need to be cut
and sewn back together or removed as part
of cancer surgery. Lymph nodes are often
removed. This is the time to ask how your neck
and face might look after surgery and your
options about facial reconstruction surgery.

Spiritual care specialists identify and
support those with spiritual distress or
unmet spiritual needs.
Smoking cessation specialists
can provide medication and counseling
for those who would like to stop using
tobacco or nicotine products.
A research team helps to collect
research data and coordinate care if
you are in a clinical trial. Clinical trials
help bring new therapies to patients and
advance the treatment for everyone.
Consider asking your care team about
access to clinical trials.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mouth Cancer, 2024

Goal of surgery
The goal of surgery is to remove all of the
cancer and keep your ability to function, such
as chew, swallow, breathe, and speak. During
surgery, the tumor is removed along with a
rim of normal-looking tissue around its edge
called the surgical margin. The surgical margin
may look normal but cancerous cells may be
found when viewed under a microscope by a

28

Treating mouth cancer » Surgery

pathologist. A clear or negative margin (R0) is
when no cancer cells are found in the tissue
around the edge of the tumor. In a positive
margin, cancer cells are found in normallooking tissue around the tumor. Your surgeon
will look carefully for cancer not only along the
surgical margin, but in other nearby areas.
Despite best efforts, it is not always possible
to find all of the cancer. Sometimes, surgeons
can’t safely remove the tumor with a cancerfree margin. Surgery often includes removal
of lymph nodes. You may have more than one
surgery. Surgery may also include rebuilding or
reconstructing any tissues that may have been
removed.

You know your body better
than anyone
Help your care team understand:

3 How you feel
3 What you need
3 What is working and what is not
Keep a list of names and contact
information for each member of your team.
This will make it easier for you and anyone
involved in your care to know whom to
contact with questions or concerns.

After surgery, you may receive treatment such
as radiation or chemotherapy with radiation
(chemoradiation) to kill any remaining cancer
cells.

Get to know your care team and
help them get to know you.

Tumor resection
Surgery to remove the entire tumor is called
tumor resection. Sometimes, the whole tumor
cannot be removed. It depends on the tumor
location, what structures are involved, how
close it is to vital organs, the depth of invasion
(DOI), and how function (such as swallowing
and speaking) will be affected. The removal of
lymph nodes is often part of cancer surgery.
For mouth cancers, as depth of invasion
increases, the risk of regional lymph node
metastases and the need for lymph node
surgery (neck dissection) also increases.

(MDT) is needed to perform high-quality
reconstruction. Find out who will be on the
reconstruction team. A MDT team is critical to
your functional and cosmetic recovery. Make
it a priority to ask your surgeons if they will
remove tissue from one part of your body to
repair or reconstruct areas of the mouth or
throat. Also, ask the expected length of the
surgery (time spent in the operating room) and
recovery. You may stay in a special nursing
area (“flap unit”) in the hospital to make sure
you recover safely. The more information you
have, the better prepared you will be.

Reconstruction after tumor
removal
If you plan to have reconstruction surgery after
tumor resection, you want to ask questions
now. For example, a multidisciplinary team

There are hundreds of lymph nodes
throughout your body. They work as filters to
help fight infection and remove harmful things
from your body. Lymph is a clear fluid that
gives cells water and food. It also helps to fight
germs. Lymph drains from lymph tissue and

A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph
node that cancer cells are most likely to spread
to from a primary tumor. Sometimes, there
can be more than one sentinel lymph node.
Removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during
surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB or SNB). It is done to determine if any
cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes.
The lymph nodes removed are called the
sentinel nodes. They may or may not contain
any cancer cells. Just because these nodes
are removed, it does not mean that they are
positive for cancer.

(the back portion of the neck)
•

5A superior half (toward the head)

•

Lymph node surgery
The removal of lymph nodes or groups of
lymph nodes is called lymph node or nodal
dissection. It might be referred to as cervical
lymphadenectomy or neck dissection and is
often part of tumor resection surgery. Lymph
nodes may be removed on the side of the
neck where the main (primary) tumor is found.
When the tumor is near the center of the neck
(midline), then lymph nodes from both sides
may be removed. The type of neck dissection
is based on tumor location and information
gathered in the pre-surgery (clinical) staging.

To find the sentinel lymph nodes, a radioactive
material and other dyes are injected into the
area where tumor is located. From here, the
dye travels through the lymphatic system to
the lymph nodes. Once the nodes are found,
those containing the radioactive material or
dye are removed and tested by a pathologist.
If cancer is found, then further treatment may
be needed.

There are different types of cervical (neck)
lymph node dissections:








Selective neck dissection (SND)
removes some of the regional lymph
nodes where the cancer is likely to travel.
Comprehensive neck dissection
removes all lymph nodes in a group or
level.
Radical neck dissection removes all
lymph nodes, and may require removing
veins, arteries, nerves, or muscle next to
the nodes.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is done
during surgery to remove the tumor.

Radiation therapy

your radiation oncologist for ways to help keep
you comfortable and calm.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, electrons,
and other sources to kill cancer cells and
shrink tumors. RT may be used as the main
treatment to cure cancer (curative treatment),
or as supportive care or palliative care to help
ease pain or discomfort caused by advanced
cancer.

You will see your radiation oncology at least
weekly to review your progress and to help
with side effects, such as sunburn-like rash,
mouth soreness, lack of taste, dry mouth,
or thick saliva. Ask your care team which
radiation option(s) are best for your situation,
if RT will be combined with chemotherapy, and
what side effects to expect. RT puts you at a
small risk of developing another cancer in the
future.

Radiation is typically delivered from outside
the body by a computerized device, which
can shape to the treatment to closely fit your
body. Treatment is given in small daily doses,
typically over 6 to 7 weeks on workdays,
with weekends off. In special circumstances,
particularly for palliative treatment, your
course of therapy may be shorter. A device
resembling a hockey goalie mask may be used
to keep you still during treatment. If you get
uncomfortable in tight spaces, please talk to

Panoramic dental x-ray is part of a
pre-radiation therapy dental evaluation. It is
needed to check the health of your jaw and
teeth to see if you need any dental work before
starting RT. It is important to tell your dentist
about your head and neck cancer and to have
regular dental cleanings and checkups.

Radiation therapy
External beam radiation
therapy (EBRT) uses a
machine outside the body to
aim radiation at the tumor(s)

Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape
of the tumor. This limits the amount of
radiation to normal tissue.

Worldwide

Stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) uses high-energy
proton or photon beams to kill or ablate
the tumor. SBRT is very precise, which
reduces the chance of damage to nearby
tissues.

area. A small radioactive seed travels into the
tube(s) and delivers radiation to the tumor area
from inside the body.

Treating mouth cancer » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
some normal cells. Sometimes, chemotherapies
are combined together, or are combined with
a checkpoint inhibitor therapy or targeted
therapy. This is called multiagent chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy might be followed by radiation
therapy or chemoradiation.

Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might
be used alone or with other therapies. Goals of
systemic therapy may be curative or palliative
and should be discussed before starting
treatment. The choice of systemic therapy
will be based on your individual needs. Your
wishes about treatment are important. Make
your wishes known.






Chemoradiation
Treatment that combines chemotherapy with
radiation therapy is called chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy may improve how well radiation
works; that is why they are sometimes used
together. For locally advanced disease,
cisplatin is often the preferred chemotherapy
drug given with radiation therapy (RT).
Chemoradiation is often used to cure your
cancer. Chemoradiation may also be used to
control symptoms caused by a tumor even if a
cure is not possible.

When systemic therapy is given before
surgery or chemoradiation, it is called
neoadjuvant or induction therapy.
When systemic therapy, chemoradiation,
or radiation therapy is given after surgery,
it is called adjuvant or postoperative
therapy.
When systemic therapy is given for
noncurable advanced or metastatic
disease, it is called palliative therapy.

For systemic therapy examples, see Guide 3.

Treating mouth cancer » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop or inhibit
the action of molecules that help cancer cells
grow and/or survive. If your tumor has certain
mutations, targeted therapy might be used.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Immunotherapy

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Immunotherapy is a type of systemic
treatment that tries to reactivate the immune
system against tumor cells. The immune
system has many on and off switches.
Tumors take advantage of turning on the "off
switches." If your tumor has a high number
of mutations, immunotherapy might be given.
Immunotherapy can be given alone or with
chemotherapy or targeted therapy.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

For more information, see NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Immunotherapy Side Effects,

Phase I trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase II trials study how well the drug
or approach works against a specific type
of cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or
approach against a standard treatment. If
the results are good, it may be approved
by the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Treating mouth cancer » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, lab
tests, or general health. These requirements
ensure that participants are alike in specific
ways and that the trial is as safe as possible
for the participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
It depends on the study, your health insurance,
and the state in which you live. In general,
procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered
standard of care will be billed to you or
your insurance, whereas those considered
research are covered by the trial sponsor. Your
treatment team and the research team can help
determine if you are responsible for any costs.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Treating mouth cancer » Supportive care

Supportive care
It is important to tell your care
team about all of your side effects
so they can be managed.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to prevent,
reduce, and relieve suffering, and to improve
quality of life. Supportive care might include
pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual
support, financial aid, or family counseling. Tell
your care team how you are feeling and about
any side effects so they can be managed.
Supportive care, best supportive care, and
palliative care often mean the same thing.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.
Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment.

Side effects

Survivorship

All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. When treatment
leads to remission (or no evidence of disease),
you will need follow-up or survivorship care for
late effects. During survivorship care you will
still have a care team, but it will look different.
Seek out peer support groups, whether online
or in person.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mouth Cancer, 2024

Treating mouth cancer » Side effects

Side effects

Cranial neuropathies
Cranial neuropathy affects the nerves in
the head and neck and might cause pain;
dizziness (vertigo); weakness, numbness,
or tingling in the face; or changes in vision,
hearing, taste, and smell. These changes
can affect speech, swallowing, and hearing,
making it difficult to communicate. This
might cause distress and impact your ability
to function and complete certain tasks at
home and at work. Your treatment may
not completely reverse these symptoms.
Treatment may also worsen or cause new
cranial neuropathies if your cancer is located
close to sensitive nerve or brain structures.
Ask your doctor about these risks, and what
can be done to minimize them. You can
also ask to see an occupational therapist
or speech-language pathologist (SLP), who
might be able to help your recovery from these
symptoms.

Difficulty eating, swallowing, or
speaking
Because of the location of mouth cancer,
difficulty eating, swallowing, or speaking are
common side effects of treatment. Difficulty
swallowing (dysphagia) or painful swallowing
(odynophagia) can be caused by cancer or its
treatment and might be long term (chronic).
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) can
help people who have trouble swallowing or
speaking.

Lymphedema
Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph
fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.
It may be caused when part of the lymph
system is damaged or blocked, such as
during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment, or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression devices, and
other means.

Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicines that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Pain

Dry mouth

Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain. Some people may benefit from
palliative radiation therapy or ablation therapy
to help relieve pain. During this treatment, a
radiation beam is focused on the tumor.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mouth Cancer, 2024

Xerostomia is the medical term for dry mouth.
Treatment for mouth cancer can affect your
salivary glands. This means you may not make
as much spit (saliva) as before and so your
mouth may become dry. It is a very common
side effect after radiation and might be long
term (chronic). Drinking plenty of water and
avoiding beverages with caffeine, alcohol,
38

Treating mouth cancer » Side effects

Low blood cell counts

or sugar can help. Special mouth rinses
are available. Continue to see your dentist
regularly.

Some cancer treatments can cause low blood
cell counts.

Fatigue



Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.





Loss of appetite
Sometimes side effects from cancer or its
treatment, and the stress of having cancer
might cause you to feel not hungry or sick
to your stomach (nauseated). You might
have a sore mouth or difficulty swallowing.
Healthy eating is important during treatment.
It includes eating a balanced diet, eating the
right amount of food, and drinking enough
fluids. A registered dietitian who is an expert
in nutrition and food can help. Weight loss is
common in those with head and neck cancer.
You might be asked to see a nutrition expert
before starting treatment to help prevent
severe weight loss.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mouth Cancer, 2024

Anemia is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to
your cells. You might tire easily if you are
anemic.
Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infection.
Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Treating mouth cancer » Side effects

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

Keep a pain diary
A pain diary is a written record that helps you
keep track of when you have pain, how bad it
is, what causes it, and what makes it better or
worse. Use a pain diary to discuss your pain
with your care team. You might be referred to
a specialist for pain management.

Neurocognitive or
neuropsychological effects
Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration, memory, and thinking.

Neuropathy

Include in your pain diary:

Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment. Most of the
time, neuropathy goes away after treatment.

Cancer or its treatment can cause a stiff neck
and shoulders and long-term (chronic) neck
pain. The stress of having cancer can also
cause tightness in the neck, shoulders, jaw,

Systemic therapy works throughout the
body. It includes chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and immunotherapy.
Targeted therapies can block the ways
cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the
body.
Immunotherapy uses your body’s natural
defenses to find and destroy cancer cells.
Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, gamma rays,
protons, photons, and other sources to kill
cancer cells and shrink tumors.
Treatment that combines chemotherapy
with radiation therapy is called
chemoradiation.
A clinical trial is a type of research that
studies a treatment to see how safe it is
and how well it works.
Supportive care is health care that
relieves symptoms caused by cancer or
its treatment and improves quality of life.
Supportive care is always given.
All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important for you to tell your
care team about all your side effects so
they can be managed.
Eating a balanced diet, drinking enough
fluids, exercise, yoga, and massage
therapy can help manage side effects.
Pain may be treated with medication, or
radiation with or without systemic therapy.
Keeping a pain diary might help you
manage pain.

Factors such as your overall health are
considered when making treatment decisions.
Your preferences about treatment are always
important. Talk to your care team and make
your wishes known.

Early stage
In early-stage (stage 1 or 2) cancer, the tumor
is less than 4 cm with depth of invasion (DOI)
of 10 mm or less. Cancer is not seen in lymph
nodes on imaging tests but may be found
during a biopsy or lymph node surgery called
neck dissection.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions

In early-stage cancer, the tumor might
be found only in the mouth or in nearby
structures.

You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

Surgery is the preferred treatment for
early-stage cancer. Radiation therapy
(RT) is also an option.
Cancer found in lymph nodes might
be treated with a combination of
surgery, systemic therapy with RT
(chemoradiation), or RT alone.

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

In locally advanced (stage 3 or 4a)
cancer, the tumor can be any size and
may have spread to nearby structures.
Cancer metastasis may be found in 1 or

Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.

Treatment such as radiation therapy or
chemoradiation might follow surgery.
After completing treatment, you will have
blood and imaging tests, physical exams,
and doctor appointments to monitor for
any signs of cancer returning. Contact
your doctor right away if you notice any
changes in your head or neck.

systemic therapy options, see Guide 5.

Recurrent or persistent disease treatment
options are based on:



If you had radiation therapy before, and
If the tumor can be removed with surgery
(resectable) or cannot be removed with
surgery (unresectable).

If surgery is an option
A resectable tumor can be removed with
surgery. If surgery is done, it might be followed
by radiation therapy (RT), chemoradiation,
or a clinical trial. A clinical trial is preferred in
some cases. Surgery is not the only option for
a resectable tumor, particularly if the surgery
is anticipated to affect swallowing or speaking.
In these cases, other options include targeted
therapy, immunotherapy, chemoradiation,
or systemic therapy followed by RT or
chemoradiation.

Key points






Advanced mouth cancer or very
advanced cancer is cancer that remains
after treatment (persistent cancer) or
cancer that has returned after a cancerfree period (recurrence). It also includes
cancer that cannot be removed with
surgery (unresectable) or cancer that
has spread to near (locoregional) or
distant (metastatic) sites through the
bloodstream.



Treatment is based on the size and
location of the tumor(s), if there is cancer
in the lymph nodes, and what treatment
you had before. Your overall health and
preferences about treatment are also
important.

Standard of care is the
best-known way to treat a
particular disease based
on past clinical trials. There
may be more than one
treatment regimen that is
considered standard of
care. Ask your care team
what treatment options are
available and if a clinical
trial might be right for you.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mouth Cancer, 2024

50

A resectable tumor can be removed
with surgery. An unresectable tumor
cannot be removed with surgery
because it is too close to vital organs.
Sometimes an unresectable tumor can
become resectable after treatment with
chemoradiation, radiation therapy, or
systemic therapy.
Metastatic disease is cancer that has
spread through the bloodstream to
distant areas of the body. A clinical trial is
preferred for metastatic disease.

Making treatment decisions » It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your
care team. If you take the time to build a
relationship with your care team, it will help
you feel supported when considering options
and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest
conversation with your care team.

Second opinion

It’s your choice

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:




What you want and how that might differ
from what others want

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments

Support groups



Your feelings about pain or side effects

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, check out the websites listed in this
book.
