About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Colon Cancer,
Version 1.2024 — January 29, 2024.

Colon cancer basics » The colon

Colon cancer is common and

The term colorectal cancer is used to describe
cancers that form in either the colon or
rectum. While these cancers are similar, their
treatment is different. The focus of this guide
is colon cancer. For information on rectal
cancer treatment, see the NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Rectal Cancer at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

treatable. Many cancers that
start in the colon can be cured,
especially when found early.

The colon
The colon makes up most of the large intestine
(bowel). In the colon water is absorbed from
eaten food, turning it into feces or stool. After
leaving the colon, stool moves into the rectum.
The rectum is the last 6 inches or so of the
large bowel. Stool is held here until it leaves
the body through an opening called the anus.

The colon
The start of the colon is a
pouch called the cecum.
Sticking out from the
cecum is the appendix.
This skinny tube is about
the size of a finger and is
closed at one end. The rest
of the colon has 4 main
sections: the ascending,
transverse, descending,
and sigmoid colon.

Polyps

Key points

Polyps are non-cancerous growths that form
on the inner lining of the colon and rectum.
The most common type is called an adenoma.
While it may take many years, adenomas
can become invasive colon cancer. Cancer
that forms in an adenoma is called an
adenocarcinoma. This is the most common
type of colon cancer. Polyps that rarely
turn into cancer include hyperplastic and
inflammatory polyps.

This guide discusses the following key topics
about colon cancer diagnosis and treatment.

called mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)

Non-metastatic cancer

While most polyps do not become cancer,
almost all colon cancers start in a polyp.
Removing polyps can prevent cancer before
it starts. Most can be removed during a
colonoscopy using a minor surgical procedure
called a polypectomy. Polyps can also be
tested to make sure that cancer has not
already started to develop.

This chapter describes testing and
other care needed to create your

with colorectal cancer are more likely to have
this cancer compared to the average person.

treatment plan. All colon cancers
should be tested for mutations
(changes) in genes that fix
damaged DNA, called mismatch

Most colon cancers occur for unknown
reasons. While rare, some people are born
with a disorder that makes them more likely
to get colon and other cancers. These are
called inherited cancer syndromes. Two such
conditions include Lynch syndrome and familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

repair (MMR) genes.

Most colon cancers are found during
colonoscopy. It is common to have another
colonoscopy to thoroughly examine the colon
and look for other possible areas of cancer.
This is called a diagnostic colonoscopy.

People born with Lynch syndrome are at high
risk of developing colon, endometrial, and
ovarian cancers. Lynch syndrome is caused
by inherited mutations of the MMR genes.
For cancers found to have the dMMR/MSI-H
biomarker, testing for Lynch syndrome is
recommended.

Mismatch repair testing
Mismatch repair (MMR) or
microsatellite instability (MSI)
testing is recommended for everyone
diagnosed with colon cancer. This
feature of some colon cancers is a type of
biomarker. Biomarkers are targetable changes
of a cancer that help guide your treatment.

FAP causes hundreds to thousands of polyps
to form in the colon and rectum. The polyps
start as benign growths, but over time can
become invasive colon cancer. Cancer often
develops by age 50 in people with classic FAP.
A milder form (attenuated FAP) causes fewer
polyps and usually starts later in life.

Testing involves analyzing a piece of the
colon tumor in a lab. Depending on the
method used, an abnormal result is called
either microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or
mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Tumors that
do not have these changes are referred to as
microsatellite stable (MSS) or mismatch repair
proficient (pMMR).

If an inherited syndrome is suspected, your
doctor will refer you to a genetic counselor.
This expert can speak with you and your
family about testing for syndromes related to
colon cancer. To be tested, you must provide
a sample of blood or saliva. A pathologist tests
the sample for gene mutations that cause
these syndromes. It is important to meet with
a genetic counselor before having any genetic
testing.

If the cancer is dMMR/MSI-H, you will also be
tested for an inherited condition called Lynch
syndrome, described next.

Testing and treatment planning » Blood tests

“

Blood tests
The following tests are not used alone to
diagnose colon cancer, but abnormal results
may signal health problems.

I was diagnosed in the ER at age
44, 58 days after my wedding, and
I faced biases and unexpected
challenges. I had to fight to get care
because I was dismissed for more
than a year for so many different
reasons. My journey taught me
this: never give up, explore every
reasonable option, and prioritize
your mental health. Your life is the
only one you have, so be true to
yourself. Before any diagnosis, put
on your life jacket first—take care
of yourself. Get screened, know
your family history. When facing
colorectal cancer, the best care
begins with self-care."

Complete blood count
Cancer and other health problems can cause
low or high blood cell counts. A complete blood
count (CBC) measures the number of white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in a
blood sample. White blood cells help the body
to fight infection. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout the body. Platelets help wounds
heal by forming blood clots.

Chemistry profile
Also known as a comprehensive metabolic
panel (CMP), this group of tests provides
information about how well your kidneys, liver,
and other organs are working.

CEA blood test
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a protein
found in blood. The level of CEA is often higher
than normal in people with colon cancer,
especially if the cancer has spread to other
organs.

ctDNA
There is growing interest in circulating tumor
DNA (ctDNA) testing for people with earlystage colon cancer. Also called a liquid
biopsy, this test looks for small pieces of DNA
released by tumor cells into the blood. It can
detect microscopic disease that may remain
in the body after colectomy. This information
may be helpful in predicting the risk of the
cancer returning or other outcomes. But more
information is needed, and at this time ctDNA
testing is only recommended as part of a
clinical trial.

Monitoring CEA can be helpful even when
the cancer is only in the colon and the level
is normal, because the level will rise if the
cancer later spreads to other organs. However,
monitoring CEA is not helpful for everyone,
even if the cancer has spread. People who
are pregnant and those who smoke may have
higher CEA levels.

allergic reaction. Tell your doctor if you’ve had
problems with contrast in the past.

Imaging tests can show areas of cancer inside
the body. A radiologist interprets the images
and conveys the results to your oncologist.
Your care team will tell you how to prepare for
your scans. If you get nervous in tight spaces,
let them know. You may be offered a type of
medicine called a sedative to help you relax.

MRI
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not often
used to plan treatment for colon cancer. Your
doctor may order an MRI to get a better look at
the liver or rectum, or if the CT scan results are
unclear.

CT

Getting an MRI is much like getting a CT scan.
In some cases, the area of the body being
imaged is placed within a narrowed coil device
that looks like a brace. It covers your body
from below your chest to the top of your legs.
It sends and receives radio waves. Straps may
be used to help you stay in place. An MRI may
cause your body to feel warm. If MRI is being
used to better see cancer near the rectum,
an enema may be needed. Or a gel may be
inserted into the rectum beforehand.

Computed tomography (CT) is the main
imaging test used to see colon cancer in the
body. During the scan you will lie face-up
on a table that moves through a tunnel-like
machine. You will be able to hear and speak
with a technician at all times.
A substance called contrast is used to make
the pictures clearer. It is injected into your vein
and mixed with a liquid to drink. You may feel
flushed or get hives. Some people have an

CT scan
CT with contrast is the
main imaging test used to
determine the extent of colon
cancer in the body. CT takes
many pictures of the inside
of the body using x-rays.
A computer combines the
x-rays to make one detailed
picture.

Testing and treatment planning » Fertility and family planning

Fertility and family planning
For unknown reasons, colon cancer is being
diagnosed more often in young adults. Some
cancer treatments make it hard or impossible
to have children. If you are interested in
potentially having children in the future, tell
your care team. They will discuss any fertilityrelated risks of your treatment plan with you.
Some methods for preserving (keeping) fertility
before cancer treatment are described below.
Your doctor may refer you for counseling about
fertility preservation options.

For more information on fertility
and family planning, see the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients
for Adolescent and Young
Adult Cancer at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Sperm banking
Sperm banking stores semen for later use by
freezing it in liquid nitrogen. The medical term
for this is semen cryopreservation.

Egg freezing
Unfertilized eggs can be removed, frozen, and
stored for later use. This is called egg freezing
or oocyte cryopreservation.

Ovarian tissue banking
This method involves removing part or all of an
ovary and freezing the part that contains the
eggs. The frozen tissue that contains the eggs
can later be unfrozen and put back in the body.

Treatment for non-metastatic cancer » Polyps with cancer

Polyps with cancer

Colon cancer often forms in
polyps on the lining of the colon,

A polyp is an overgrowth of cells on the inner
lining of the colon wall. The most common type
is called an adenoma. While it may take many
years, adenomas can become invasive colon
cancer. Cancer that starts in an adenoma is
called an adenocarcinoma.

but can also form as lesions.
This chapter explains treatment
for cancer that has not spread to
areas far from the colon.

There are 2 main shapes of polyps.
Pedunculated polyps are shaped like
mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall.
They have a stalk and round top. Sessile
polyps are flatter and do not have a stalk. A
polyp in which cancer has just started to grow
is called a malignant (cancerous) polyp.
Most polyps can be removed during a
colonoscopy, using a minor surgical procedure
called a polypectomy.

Colon polyps
Polyps are growths on
the inner lining of the
bowel wall. Some look
like mushrooms and
stick out from the colon
wall. These are called
pedunculated polyps.
Others are flatter and do
not have a stalk. These
are called sessile polyps.

Invasive cancer

Often, no further treatment is needed after
a polypectomy. In other cases, surgery
(resection) of a bigger piece of the colon is
needed. This depends on:

For cancers not found early enough to be
removed by polypectomy, colectomy (colon
surgery) is needed. Surgery is only an option if
the colon tumor can be completely removed. If
you cannot have surgery first, see page 19.

The results of testing the removed tissue.

Colectomy
A colectomy is a surgery that removes the part
of the colon with cancer. After the cancerous
part is removed, the two healthy ends of the
remaining colon are sewn or stapled together.
At least 12 lymph nodes near the tumor will be
removed and tested for cancer, in addition to
any nodes that look abnormal to the surgeon.

Before deciding whether resection is needed
after a polypectomy, your doctor will review
the results of testing with you and discuss your
options.

A colectomy can be done in two ways. The
open method removes tumor tissue through a

Colectomy
Surgery for colon cancer is called colectomy. It involves removing the cancerous part of the
colon. The two healthy ends of the remaining colon are then attached to each other.

large cut in your abdomen. The minimally
invasive method involves making a few small
cuts. Tools are inserted through the cuts to see
and remove part of your colon.

of the abdomen. This opening is called a
stoma. Stool exits the body through the stoma
and enters a bag attached to the skin. This
is typically only needed for a short time. For
colon cancer surgery, the colostomy can often
be reversed with another operation. Colostomy
is also known as diversion because it diverts
(redirects) the flow of stool.

The tissue removed during surgery is sent to
a pathologist. The pathologist determines how
far the cancer has grown within the colon wall.
They also test the removed lymph nodes for
cancer. These results are used to assign the
cancer a stage. The stage helps determine
whether you need chemotherapy after surgery.
At the time of colectomy, some people may
also have a procedure called a colostomy. This
is done in cases where it may not be safe to
reconnect the remaining sections of colon. In
a colostomy, the remaining upper part of the
colon is attached to an opening on the surface

Colostomy
If the two healthy ends of the remaining colon cannot be safely reconnected after the cancer
is removed, a colostomy may be performed. A colostomy connects a part of the colon to the
outside of the abdomen. This creates an opening in your abdomen that allows stool to pass
through. For colon cancer surgery, it is rare for a colostomy not to be reversed with another
operation.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Treatment for non-metastatic cancer » Invasive cancer

Bowel blockage
In rare cases, a tumor may grow so large that
it blocks the flow of stool. There are several
ways to deal with a blockage. One option is a
colectomy that also unblocks the bowel. This is
known as a one-stage colectomy.

Your care team will give you
information on:

A second option is colectomy with colostomy.
This is typically only needed for a short time.
Another possibility is that a colostomy may
be done first, followed by a second surgery to
remove the cancer.
Lastly, in rare cases, a mesh metal tube called
a stent may be placed first, followed by a
second surgery to remove the cancer. The
stent keeps the colon open, allowing gas and
stool to pass.

Staging
The cancer stage describes the extent of
cancer in the body. Having a general idea of
the structure of the colon wall is helpful for
understanding how colon cancer is staged.
The colon wall is made of layers of tissue.
Cancer starts in the innermost layer that
comes in contact with food. This layer is called
the mucosa.

How to prepare for surgery

•

What to expect during and after surgery

•

Recovery

•

Possible short- and long-term side
effects of colectomy, including:
¬

Leaking from the spot where the
colon was reconnected (anastomotic
leak)

¬

Changes in bowel habits

¬

Bowel blocked by scar tissue

¬

Organs pushing through tissues
or muscles weakened by surgery
(hernia)

Cancer cells can also break off from the colon
tumor and travel through lymph or blood to
nearby lymph nodes.

The next layer is the submucosa. It is made of
connective tissue and contains mucus glands,
blood and lymph vessels, and nerves. The
submucosa is followed by a layer of muscle
called the muscularis propria. The outer, fourth
layer is called serosa (or adventitia).

The American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system
is used to stage colon cancer. In the AJCC
system, the following key pieces of information
about the cancer are used to give it a stage:

If left untreated, cancer cells grow through the
layers of the colon wall, towards the inside
of the abdomen. The cancer can then invade
structures or organs outside of the colon.

If you can’t have surgery first

T: How far the tumor has grown into or
through the colon wall

Having surgery first is not always an option. It
may not be possible because of the location
of the tumor, or because of other health
problems. In this case, systemic therapy
(chemotherapy or immunotherapy) is given
first. Systemic therapy may also be given
first for advanced cancers, or cancer that has
spread to lymph nodes.

N: Whether any lymph nodes have cancer
M: Whether the cancer has spread
to areas or organs outside the colon
(metastasized)

The T, N, and M scores are combined to
assign the cancer one of the following stages:
0, I (1), II (2), III (3), or IV (4). The stages are
explained below.

If this approach is planned, chemotherapy
is recommended for pMMR/MSS cancers.
Immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor
is preferred for dMMR/MSI-H cancers.
Immunotherapy increases the activity of your
immune system, improving your body’s ability
to find and destroy cancer cells.

Stage 0
There are abnormal cells on the innermost
layer of the colon wall. These abnormal cells
may become cancer and spread into deeper
layers of the colon wall. Stage 0 colon cancer
is also called carcinoma in situ of the colon.

Checkpoint inhibitors recommended for use
before colectomy in dMMR/MSI-H cancers
include:

Stage 1
The cancer has grown into either the second
or third layer of the colon wall. There is no
cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas
outside the colon.




Stage 2
The cancer has grown into, or beyond, the
fourth layer of the colon wall. There is no
cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas
outside the colon.

Nivolumab (Opdivo) with or without
ipilimumab (Yervoy)

Sometimes radiation therapy (alone or with
chemotherapy) is given along with systemic
therapy for unresectable cancers.
For more information on the side effects
of checkpoint inhibitors, see the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Immunotherapy Side
Effects: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Stage 3
The cancer has spread from the colon to
nearby lymph nodes or there are tumor
deposits. Tumor deposits are small tumors in
the fat around the colon.
Stage 4
The cancer has spread to areas outside the
colon and nearby lymph nodes. Colon cancer
spreads most often to the liver and/or lungs.

Treatment for non-metastatic cancer » Chemotherapy after surgery

Chemotherapy after surgery
Side effects

Chemotherapy is the use of medicine to kill
cancer cells. It is a type of systemic therapy.
Chemotherapy is usually given intravenously.
This means the medicine is slowly infused
into the bloodstream through a vein. It travels
through the bloodstream to reach cells
throughout the body.

Systemic therapy kills both cancer cells
and healthy cells. The damage to healthy
cells can cause hair loss, cracked skin,
mouth sores, and other side effects.
Managing side effects is a shared effort
between you and your care team. It is
important to speak up about bothersome
side effects, such as nausea and vomiting.
Ask about your options for managing or
relieving the effects of treatment.

Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment
days followed by days of rest. This allows your
body to recover between cycles. Cycles vary in
length depending on which drugs are used.

Stage 1

More information on supportive care is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient Guides for
Cancer app.

Chemotherapy is not recommended after
colectomy for stage 1 cancers.

Stage 2
Chemotherapy is not recommended after
colectomy for stage 2A and 2B dMMR/MSI-H
cancers, but may be given for some stage 2C
dMMR/MSI-H cancers.
Chemotherapy is recommended after
colectomy for some stage 2 pMMR/MSS
cancers. It is most helpful for cancers with
a high risk of recurrence (returning after
treatment). Your doctor will consider the
features and risk factors of the cancer
to determine if recurrence is likely. If
chemotherapy is planned, recommended
regimens include capecitabine and
5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin. These are
given for 6 months. FOLFOX and CAPEOX
are recommended options for high-risk
cancers. FOLFOX is given for 6 months;
CAPEOX for 3 months.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Colon Cancer, 2024

Stage 3
Chemotherapy is recommended after
colectomy for all stage 3 colon cancers.
Preferred regimens include CAPEOX and
FOLFOX. Other recommended options include
capecitabine and 5-FU.
Chemotherapy is typically given for 3 to 6
months. The length of treatment depends on
the regimen and the risk of recurrence.

Surveillance

tests may be ordered if your doctor thinks the
cancer may have come back or spread.

Follow-up testing is started when there are no
signs of cancer after treatment. It can help find
new cancer growth early.

Stages 2 and 3
In addition to colonoscopy, surveillance for
stages 2 and 3 colon cancer includes physical
exams, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
blood tests, and CT scans. The recommended
schedule for surveillance testing is shown in
Guide 1.

Stage 1
A colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after
surgery for stage 1 cancers. If the results are
normal, your next colonoscopy should be in 3
years, and then every 5 years. If a concerning
or high-risk adenoma is found, your next
colonoscopy will be needed within 1 year.

In addition to surveillance testing, a range of
other care is important for cancer survivors.
For more information, see Chapter 5:
Survivorship.

If you don’t have any symptoms, other testing
is not needed on a regular basis. Imaging

Biomarker testing
Biomarkers are targetable features of a
cancer. They are often mutations (changes)
in particular genes. When possible, biomarker
testing is performed on a piece of tumor tissue
removed during a biopsy or surgery. If this isn't
possible, a sample of blood can be tested. All
metastatic colon cancers should be tested for
the following biomarkers:


A team of experts can determine the best local
therapy for your metastatic tumor(s). To learn if
surgery or treatment with other local therapies
is an option, your case should be evaluated
by a multidisciplinary team of experts. The
team should include a surgeon experienced
in removing liver and lung tumors and an
interventional oncologist/radiologist.

vein embolization. An interventional radiologist
inserts a catheter into certain veins in the liver.
This blocks the blood vessel to the liver tumor,
causing the healthy part of the liver to grow.

Embolization
If the cancer has spread only (or mainly) to the
liver, treatment with intra-arterial liver-directed
therapies may be an option. These therapies
may be considered for liver tumors that:

Ablation
Image-guided thermal ablation destroys small
liver or lung tumors. A specialized needle is
placed directly into or next to the target tumor.
This probe delivers targeted energy to the

Cannot be resected or ablated.

Intra-arterial therapies treat liver tumors with
chemotherapy beads (chemoembolization)
or radioactive spheres (radioembolization).
If radiation spheres are used, it is known as
selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)
or transarterial hepatic radioembolization
(TARE). These procedures are performed by
interventional oncologists/radiologists.

Radiofrequency and microwave ablation
are commonly used methods that kill cancer
cells using heat. Cold energy (cryoablation)
is used sometimes, mostly for lung tumors.
Less common types include irreversible
electroporation (“nanoknife”) and laser
ablation.

A catheter is inserted into an artery in your leg
or wrist and guided to the liver tumor(s). Once
in place, the spheres or beads are injected into
the blood vessel leading to the tumor. They
collect inside the tumor and deliver radiation or
chemotherapy, causing the cancer cells to die.

Thermal ablation may be used in addition to
surgery, or alone for small tumors that can be
fully removed. It will only be used if all visible
areas of cancer can be destroyed. Ablation
may be performed by either an interventional
radiologist or a surgeon. Sometimes it can be
done in a single session in the interventional
radiology department.

The chemotherapy beads can also work to
starve the tumor by stopping its blood supply.
The chemotherapy or radiation further damage
the cancer cells and cause the tumor to shrink.
When embolization with chemotherapy is
not an option, small beads may be used to
physically block blood supply to the tumor. This
is called bland embolization.
HAIC
Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC)
is chemotherapy given directly to the liver. It is
often given in addition to standard intravenous
chemotherapy. Using a port or pump that is

usually placed during surgery to remove liver
tumors, the drugs are funneled directly into the
artery leading to the liver. HAIC should only be
performed by medical oncologists at treatment
centers with experience in this method.

In SBRT, high doses of radiation are delivered
to metastatic tumor(s) using very precise
beams. The radiation comes from a large
machine outside the body. The radiation
passes through skin and other tissue to reach
the tumor(s). Treatment with SBRT is typically
complete in 5 or fewer sessions, called
fractions.

Stereotactic body radiation

Stage 4 cancer in the liver
or lungs

Recommended first-line regimens are listed
below. The targeted therapy bevacizumab
(Avastin) may be added to any of these
regimens:

When possible, surgery and systemic therapy
is the recommended treatment approach for
these cancers. The choice of systemic therapy
(chemotherapy or immunotherapy) depends
on the mismatch repair (MMR) status of the
cancer.
Surgery involves colectomy to remove the
colon tumor. The liver or lung tumors are
resected when the colectomy is performed, or
later as a separate surgery. If the metastatic
tumors are small, removing or destroying them
with local therapies may be an option—alone
or with surgery.

FOLFIRI



FOLFOX

CAPEOX



FOLFIRINOX

For some pMMR/MSS cancers, FOLFIRI
or FOLFOX may be given with a targeted
therapy—either panitumumab (Vectibix) or
cetuximab (Erbitux). These regimens are
only recommended for tumors without RAS
(KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutations.
While uncommon, systemic therapy may
shrink the tumors enough to be removed with
surgery and/or local therapies. After surgery,
most people will have more systemic therapy.
In some cases, observation or a short course
of chemotherapy may be possible.

pMMR/MSS cancer
Your doctor may recommend 2 to 3 months
of chemotherapy before, after, or between
surgeries. This is in addition to the
chemotherapy that is recommended for
everyone after surgery, called adjuvant
chemotherapy.

If the tumors do not become resectable during
first-line therapy, systemic therapy is typically
continued. The goal is to slow the growth and
spread of the cancer.

The goal of adjuvant chemotherapy is to kill
any cancer cells that may remain in the body.
Either FOLFOX or CAPEOX is preferred.
Capecitabine and 5-FU/leucovorin are also
options if needed. After chemotherapy,
surveillance begins.

If the cancer progresses, the regimen you
receive next may be different from what you
had before. The choice will depend on prior
systemic therapy you’ve had and how well
you are expected to tolerate certain regimens.
Another important factor is whether the tumor
has any biomarkers. Regimens targeting
specific biomarkers are listed in Guide 2 on
the next page.

If all areas of cancer cannot be removed
with surgery and/or local therapies,
stage 4 colon cancer is treated with systemic
therapy. Systemic therapy given first is called
first-line therapy.

Treatment for metastatic cancer » Stage 4 cancer in the abdomen

Stage 4 cancer in the
abdomen

Another recommended treatment approach
for these cancers is surgery followed by
chemotherapy. Either FOLFOX or CAPEOX is
preferred. Capecitabine and 5-FU/leucovorin
are also options if needed.

Some people with metastatic colon cancer
will also form tumors in the layer of tissue that
lines the abdomen, called the peritoneum.
The peritoneum covers most of the abdominal
organs.

If all areas of cancer cannot be removed
with surgery and/or local therapies, stage 4
colon cancer is treated with systemic therapy.
If you are a candidate and haven’t had
immunotherapy, treatment with a checkpoint
inhibitor is recommended. Your doctor will
check the extent of the cancer every 2 to 3
months. Surgery may become possible. Or you
may continue immunotherapy or switch to a
different systemic therapy.

In most cases, systemic therapy is given with
the goal of relieving or preventing symptoms.
The regimen you receive will depend on
whether the tumor has any biomarkers and
how well you are expected to tolerate certain
systemic therapies.
Tumors growing in or around the bowel can
block stool from moving and leaving the body.
In this case, the bowel needs to be unblocked
before starting systemic therapy. This is done
using one of several surgical techniques, or
with a mesh metal tube called a stent.

If you’ve already had immunotherapy, another
type of systemic therapy is recommended.

Cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC
In a small number of people, cytoreductive
surgery and/or hyperthermic intraperitoneal
chemotherapy (HIPEC) may be treatment
options. But research is needed on whether
the benefits of these treatments outweigh
the possible harms. They are only used
in specialized centers and under certain
circumstances.
Cytoreductive surgery involves surgically
removing all visible tumors. If the tumor cannot
be separated from the surface of an organ,
the organ may also need to be removed. In
HIPEC, a heated chemotherapy solution is put
directly into the abdominal cavity through small
tubes called catheters.

Treatment for metastatic cancer » Distant recurrence

Distant recurrence

For cancers without biomarkers, chemotherapy
with FOLFIRI or irinotecan is a recommended
first-line option. A biologic may be given with
chemotherapy. Biologics include bevacizumab,
ziv-aflibercept, ramucirumab, cetuximab, and
panitumumab.

After treatment for non-metastatic colon
cancer, the cancer may return and spread to
the liver, lungs, or other areas. This is called
a distant recurrence. Treatment with surgery
and/or local therapies is recommended if all of
the tumors can be totally removed. But, this is
uncommon, and most distant recurrences are
treated with systemic therapy.

Resectable pMMR/MSS cancer
If you have received treatment with
chemotherapy, one recommended
option is resection (and/or treatment with
local therapies) first, followed by either
chemotherapy or observation. Observation
is preferred for those who have already had
treatment with oxaliplatin.

Systemic therapy may shrink the tumors
enough to be removed with surgery. If your
doctor thinks this might be possible, the size
of the tumors will be checked about every 2
months during systemic therapy. If the cancer
does not become resectable, systemic therapy
is typically continued. The goal is to slow the
growth and spread of the cancer.

A second option is 2 to 3 months of
chemotherapy first, followed by resection
(and/or treatment with local therapies). More
chemotherapy may follow.

Specific recommendations are provided below
according to the mismatch repair status of the
cancer and whether resection is possible.

If you have not had any chemotherapy,
resection (and/or treatment with local
therapies) is often performed first, followed by
chemotherapy. FOLFOX and CAPEOX are
preferred for chemotherapy. Capecitabine and
5-FU/leucovorin are also options if needed.

Unresectable pMMR/MSS cancer
If you’ve had recent treatment with FOLFOX
or CAPEOX, you should not have more
chemotherapy that includes oxaliplatin.
Oxaliplatin can cause serious nerve damage.
Your options for systemic therapy will
depend, in part, on whether the cancer has
any biomarkers. Therapies targeting the
biomarkers listed below are available:

months. Surgery may become possible. Or,
you may continue immunotherapy or switch to
a different systemic therapy.

Supportive care is available for
everyone with cancer. It isn't
meant to treat the cancer, but
rather to help with symptoms and
make you more comfortable.

If you’ve already had immunotherapy, another
type of systemic therapy is recommended.
This may be oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy
such as FOLFOX or CAPEOX. Or, if the

Treatment for metastatic cancer » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.





Phase 1 trials study the safety and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach.

Start the conversation

Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. Try not to
be discouraged if you cannot join. New clinical
trials are always becoming available.

Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Finding a clinical trial

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and

screening tests you should have based on
your age and risk level.

Aspirin
Talk to your doctor about the possible risks and
benefits of long-term aspirin therapy to help
prevent the return of colorectal cancers.

Other health care
Get other recommended health care for
your age, such as blood pressure screening,
hepatitis C screening, and immunizations (like
the flu shot).

Quit smoking
If you smoke or vape, quit! Your doctor will be
able to provide (or refer you for) counseling on
how to stop smoking.

Experts recommend eating
a diet that includes a lot of
plant-based foods, such
as vegetables, fruits, and
whole grains.

Survivorship focuses on the physical,
emotional, and financial issues unique to
cancer survivors.
Ideally, your oncologist and primary care
doctor will work together to provide the
follow-up care you need.
A survivorship care plan is helpful in
transitioning your care to your primary
care doctor.
Healthy habits, including exercising and
eating right, play an important role in
helping to prevent other diseases and
second cancers.

Making treatment decisions » It’s your choice » Questions to ask

It’s important to be comfortable

and share concerns with your care team. If you
take the time to build a relationship with your
care team, it will help you feel supported when
considering options and making treatment
decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest
conversation with your care team.

Second opinion
It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:




What you want and how that might differ
from what others want

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Your religious and spiritual beliefs

Support groups



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.






Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life and length of life
How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Questions to ask

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of specific
treatments and procedures. Weigh options
