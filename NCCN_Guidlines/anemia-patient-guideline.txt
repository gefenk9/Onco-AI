Blood basics

Blood is a body fluid made up of 4
factors: plasma, red blood cells, white
blood cells, and platelets. Blood has
many functions, including carrying
oxygen and nutrients. This chapter
provides a look at the various blood cell
types and their functions.

Blood cells have important jobs. Red blood
cells carry oxygen throughout the body. White
blood cells fight infection. Platelets help control
bleeding. Plasma transports red blood cells,
white blood cells, and platelets.
Blood cells don’t live forever. Normal red blood
cells live for 3 months. Normal white blood
cells live for 8 to 14 days. Normal platelets live
for about a week (7 days). After cells reach
these ages, they die off and are replaced by
new cells. Your blood cells are being replaced
in your body all the time.

Blood basics
Blood is made up of plasma and cells that
float within it. Plasma is the liquid part of the
blood, comprised mostly of water. Plasma also
contains proteins, hormones, vitamins, and
minerals. Blood takes oxygen and nutrients to
your body’s tissues, and carries away wastes.

Blood has many functions. These include:


Blood stem cells
Bone marrow contains
stem cells. A blood stem
cell is an immature cell
that can develop into a
red blood cell, a white
blood cell, or a platelet.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®:
Anemia and Neutropenia, 2021

Transport - Blood takes oxygen from
the lungs to the cells of the body. It takes
carbon dioxide from the body’s cells to the
lungs where it is breathed out. Blood also
carries nutrients, hormones, and waste
products around the body.

1

Blood



Regulate - Blood helps to keep the
acid-alkali balance of the body in check.
It also plays a part in regulating body
temperature. Increasing the amount of
blood flowing close to the skin helps the
body to lose heat.



Blood cell types
check on the size, number, shape, and health
of your red blood cells.
If red blood cells are damaged, they are no
longer able to carry oxygen and can release
toxins. This may lead to kidney damage.
Problems with red blood cells may be caused
by illness or a lack of iron or vitamins in your
diet. Some diseases of the red blood cells are
inherited (passed down from one’s parents
or ancestors). Diseases of the red blood cells
include many types of anemia. Anemia is a
condition where your body does not make
enough healthy red blood cells, resulting in
less oxygen in your cells.

Protect - White blood cells attack and
destroy invading germs (bacteria) and
other pathogens. Blood clots form after an
injury, which protects the body from losing
too much blood.

Blood cell types

White blood cells

There are 3 types of blood cells:


Red blood cells (erythrocytes)



White blood cells (leukocytes)



Platelets

White blood cells (WBCs) are essential to the
immune system by helping to fight infections.
For example, if a microorganism (bacteria
or virus) enters the blood, through a cut or
an infection, white blood cells surround and
destroy the invading cells.

Red blood cells

There are several types of white blood cells:

Red blood cells (RBCs) look like tiny flat
doughnuts without holes. They get their color
from hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein
that picks up oxygen in the lungs. As the
blood travels throughout the body, hemoglobin
releases oxygen to different body parts. Then,
red blood cells pick up carbon dioxide from
tissues and organs and carry it back into the
lungs for removal.

Monocytes



Lymphocytes



Neutrophils



Basophils



Eosinophils

Monocytes
Monocytes are the largest type of white blood
cells. They have a longer lifespan than other
white blood cells. Monocytes help to break
down bacteria and clean up dead cells.

Red blood cells live for about 120 days. Each
day, the body makes new red blood cells. They
are made inside part of the bone called bone
marrow. Bone marrow produces 7.5 billion
red blood cells every hour, or 2 million each
second. Your doctor will use a blood test to

Blood cell types

Lymphocytes
Lymphocytes are a form of white blood cell. All
lymphocytes fight bacteria, viruses, and other
potentially harmful invaders. However, some
white blood cells have specific jobs.

Eosinophils
Eosinophils attack and kill bacteria and
parasites (such as worms), and help with
allergic responses. These cells are best known
for their role in creating allergy symptoms
when fighting off invaders (such as pollen).

There are 3 types of lymphocytes:


B lymphocytes (B cells) make antibodies
to help the body fight infections.



T lymphocytes (T cells) attack foreign
cells, cancer cells, and virus-infected
cells.



Natural killer cells (NK cells) kill virusinfected cells or tumor cells. These cells
are different in that they can “remember”
certain virus cells for many years and
fight to keep the body from being infected
again.

Platelets

Platelets (thrombocytes) are tiny, plate-shaped
cells that form clots. Platelets circulate in the
blood. When a damaged blood vessel is found,
they bind together to create a clot. Platelets
work with proteins called clotting factors to
control bleeding inside your body and on your
skin. Platelets only survive about 9 days in
the bloodstream. They are constantly being
replaced by new platelets made in the bone
marrow.

Plasma

Neutrophils
Neutrophils kill and digest bacteria and fungi.
They are the most numerous type of white
blood cell, making up nearly half of all white
blood cells. They are the first line of defense
when infection strikes.

Plasma is a straw-colored liquid that makes up
more than half (60%) of the blood’s volume.
Plasma contains water, salts, enzymes,
antibodies, and other proteins. Plasma
serves as a transportation system by bringing
nutrients (such as proteins, minerals, vitamins,
sugars, and fats) to all parts of the body, and
carrying away waste.

Basophils
Basophils sound an alarm when infectious
agents invade your blood. They secrete
chemicals such as histamine (a marker of
allergic disease), which helps control the
body’s immune response.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®:
Anemia and Neutropenia, 2021

This transportation system allows for a
constant circulation of white blood cells and
antibodies. The circulation in the plasma
allows the white blood cells to travel wherever
they are needed to fight infections. Also,
plasma allows clotting proteins to travel where
blood clots are needed. Clotting proteins in the
plasma are required for platelets to form blood
clots.

How blood is made

Bone marrow

Stem cells that circulate in the veins and
arteries are called peripheral blood stem
cells. People recovering from chemotherapy
or healthy people treated with certain drugs
to stimulate bone marrow cell growth tend to
have a large number of peripheral blood stem
cells.

Bone marrow is a spongy substance found in
the center of the bones. Bone marrow contains
parent cells called stem cells. Stem cells can
rapidly divide and clone themselves to form
new cells. Healthy bone marrow is needed to
make blood cells.
There are two types of bone marrow:


Red bone marrow produces blood cells



Yellow bone marrow stores fat

How blood is made
Your body makes millions of blood cells every
day. Each cell type lives for a certain period of
time. Red blood cells can live for months, while
white blood cells live for days or hours. When
a blood cell dies, it is broken down by the
body. Normally, there is a balance between the
number of blood cells created and those that
die and are broken down.

Red bone marrow is involved in hematopoiesis
(blood cell production). Red bone marrow can
develop into a variety of different blood cells,
including red blood cells and platelets. As you
get older, your red bone marrow is gradually
replaced with yellow bone marrow. Yellow
bone marrow stores fats. Fat is used as an
energy source as needed. Yellow bone marrow
also contains mesenchymal stem cells (cells
that can develop into bone, fat, cartilage, or
muscle cells). Over time, most bones in adults
contain increasing amounts of yellow bone
marrow.

Hormones in the bloodstream and chemicals in
the bone marrow help to maintain this balance.

Stem cells

Stem cells are special cells that can develop
into different cell types including new red blood
cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Stem
cells continually divide and create new cells.
The new cells may remain stem cells or form
into mature blood cells. Mature blood cells
are released from the bone marrow into the
bloodstream. Stem cells are the only cell in the
body that have the ability to create new cell
types.



Erythropoietin (a hormone made in the
kidneys) increases the creation of red
blood cells.



Thrombopoietin (a hormone made in the
liver and kidney) increases the creation of
platelets.



Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(a chemical produced in the body)
increases the creation and release of
neutrophils and other white blood cells
from the bone marrow.



Growth factors (a general term for
chemicals or hormones) help regulate the
number of blood cells created.

Anemia

Anemia
Anemia is a condition where your body does
not make enough healthy blood cells, resulting
in less oxygen being carried to your cells.

You may not have
symptoms of anemia
right away. Speak with
your doctor about
treatment options.

There are different types of anemia, including:


Anemia associated with bone marrow
disease or cancer/cancer treatment



Aplastic anemia



Hemolytic anemia



Iron deficiency anemia



Sickle cell anemia



Vitamin deficiency anemia

Hemolytic anemia

Anemia associated with bone marrow
disease or cancer/cancer treatment

Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood
cells are destroyed faster than bone marrow
can replace them. Hemolytic anemia can be
acquired in two ways: either you can inherit it,
or you can develop it later in life.

Anemia associated with bone marrow disease
affects the blood produced in your bone
marrow. This anemia includes a variety of
diseases, such as leukemia and myelofibrosis.
In people with cancer, anemia can also be
caused by chemotherapy treatments.

Sickle cell anemia

Sickle cell anemia is an inherited and serious
condition. It is caused by a defective form
of hemoglobin that forces red blood cells to
assume an abnormal crescent (moon) shape.
The irregular blood cells die too soon, resulting
in an ongoing shortage of red blood cells.

Aplastic anemia

In aplastic anemia, normal blood cell
production slows or stops. This occurs
because bone marrow stem cells are
damaged. The number of stem cells also goes
down because they are unable to replicate
themselves or are being destroyed by a part of
the immune system.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®:
Anemia and Neutropenia, 2021

Iron deficiency anemia

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common
type of anemia. It is caused by a lack of iron
in your body. Your bone marrow needs iron to
make hemoglobin. Without enough iron, your
body can’t produce enough hemoglobin for red
blood cells.

11

Blood

Neutropenia | Thrombocytopenia

Neutropenia

Vitamin deficiency anemia

Similar to iron, vitamins (folate, vitamin B12,
vitamin C) are essential to making healthy red
blood cells. Vitamin deficiency anemia can
occur if you do not eat enough foods that have
folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin C. It can also
occur if your body has trouble absorbing or
processing these vitamins.

Neutropenia refers to a decrease in
neutrophils, the most common type of white
blood cell. A low number of white blood cells
can lead to frequent or severe infections.
A person with neutropenia may experience:

Symptoms depend on your specific type of
anemia. Mild symptoms can be so mild that
they go unnoticed. However, as your body
loses more iron and the anemia gets worse,
symptoms also increase.
Anemia signs and symptoms may include:



Frequent fevers or infections



Bladder infections that are painful or
make you urinate more often



Lung infections that cause coughing and
difficulty breathing



Mouth sores



Fatigue



Sinus infections



Weakness



Skin infections



Pale skin



Chest pain, fast heartbeat, or shortness of
breath



Headache, dizziness, or lightheadedness



Cold hands and feet



Loss of appetite

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®:
Anemia and Neutropenia, 2021

More information is provided on neutropenia in
the next chapter.

Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia refers to a condition where
there are not enough platelets found in the
blood. Platelets are important; they help your
blood clot, which stops bleeding. If there are
not enough platelets in your blood, you may
experience bruising and excessive bleeding
from wounds or injuries to other tissues.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

Myelodysplastic syndromes

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fastgrowing blood cancer that starts in diseasefighting lymphocytes of your immune system.
In ALL, bone marrow makes too many
immature lymphocytes called lymphoblasts.
Lymphoblasts can crowd out other blood cells
causing blood to not work as it should. Acute
leukemias grow faster than chronic leukemias.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a rare
group of bone marrow disorders. In MDS, the
body does not make enough healthy blood
cells for the bone marrow. Bone marrow is a
spongy substance found in the center of the
bones. Bone marrow contains parent cells
called stem cells. In normal bone marrow, stem
cells can rapidly divide and clone themselves
to form new cells.

ALL can be found in bone marrow, blood, and
organs such as the testicles or the central
nervous system (CNS).

In MDS, some stem cells are abnormal.
Abnormal cells may not develop into normal
cells. Instead, abnormal, immature cells crowd
out normal cells in the bone marrow.

Acute myeloid leukemia

For more information on blood disorders
such as MDS, AML, and/or ALL, read the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Acute Myeloid
Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
or Myelodysplastic Syndromes, available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a fastgrowing cancer of myeloid progenitor cells.
Changes in these cells stop myeloid blasts
(or myeloblasts) from becoming mature
blood cells. As a result, there is a buildup of
abnormal blasts in the marrow and blood. In
turn, there are not enough red blood cells,
platelets, and mature white blood cells.

General health tests

General health tests

In anemia, your body does not make
enough healthy red blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried
to your cells. This chapter reviews tests
used to diagnose anemia.

Family history

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families. Your doctor will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members about their
health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed.

A blood test called a complete blood count
(CBC) test is used to diagnose anemia. The
test results include the number of red blood
cells in a person’s body. A red blood cell count
is measured in several ways.

Health history

Common measurements for a CBC include:


Hemoglobin



Hematocrit

A health history is a record of all health issues
and treatments you have had in your life.
Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
A health history will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Hemoglobin is a red protein that transports
oxygen in the blood. Hematocrit refers to the
percentage of blood that is made up of red
blood cells.
People with specific cancer types or those who
are receiving certain cancer treatments may
have regular blood tests. These tests look for
anemia and other blood-related problems. If
test results show that you have anemia, you
may need additional tests to find the cause.
Anemia does not always cause symptoms. You
may find out you have anemia when checking
for another condition.

Medical exam

A medical exam checks the body for signs of
disease.
A health care provider may:

Your risk for anemia is based on results of
blood tests. Blood tests for anemia include
a CBC with indices, blood smear, and
reticulocyte count and mean corpuscular
volume (MCV).

Testing



Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin. Tell the doctor
if you have felt any lumps or have any

Blood tests | Hemorrhage
Reticulocyte count

A reticulocyte count test measures the number
of young red blood cells in the blood. The test
shows whether your bone marrow is making
red blood cells at the correct rate. This test
helps to determine the cause and type of
anemia.

Doctors should perform a thorough exam
along with a complete health history.

Mean corpuscular volume

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) measures
the average size of red blood cells. This test is
especially helpful in identifying iron-deficiency
anemia, as red blood cells are smaller than
normal.

Blood tests
Complete blood count with indices

A complete blood count (CBC) is used to
measure the number and physical makeup of
cells found in your blood. Your doctor will be
specifically interested in red blood cell levels
within the hematocrit and hemoglobin in your
blood. Hemoglobin is a protein in the red blood
cells. Hematocrit measures how much space
red blood cells take up in the blood. A low level
of either of these is a sign of anemia.

Hemorrhage
A hemorrhage refers to a release of blood from
a broken blood vessel (either inside or outside
the body). A stool guaiac or endoscopy is used
to test for hemorrhage. A stool guaiac test
(fecal occult test) looks for hidden blood in the
stool. The test is performed by taking a small
stool sample on guaiac paper and applying a
drop or two of hydrogen peroxide. If there is
blood present, the sample will immediately turn
blue.

The indices for the CBC include:


Average red blood cell size



Hemoglobin amount per red blood cell



The amount of hemoglobin compared to
the size of the cell per red blood cell

An endoscopy is used to look at the upper
digestive tract for signs of bleeding. An
endoscopy is a nonsurgical test that uses
an endoscope (flexible tube with a light and
camera) to look inside a person’s digestive
tract.

If your CBC results indicate anemia, your
doctor may ask for further blood testing
including a blood smear test.

Blood smear

A blood smear is a blood test used to look for
abnormal blood cells. A smear test looks at
both your red and white blood cells. It helps
define the shape of red blood cells and the
presence of abnormal cells.

Testing

Hemolysis

Hemolysis

Direct antiglobulin test

A direct antiglobulin test is used to diagnose
hemolytic anemia caused by your immune
system. Your immune system is your body’s
defense system. It makes proteins called
antibodies to attack invading cells. Hemolytic
anemia stimulates your immune system to
make antibodies that mistakenly attack your
own red blood cells.

In hemolytic anemia, your damaged red blood
cells grow faster than the bone marrow’s ability
to make new cells.
If you are suspected of having hemolytic
anemia, your doctor may request one of the
following tests:


Direct antiglobulin test (DAT)



Disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC) panel



Haptoglobin



Indirect bilirubin



Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

Disseminated intravascular
coagulation panel

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
is a serious condition where clotting proteins in
the blood become overactive. This may disrupt
normal blood flow to organs and can lead to
organ failure. Tests are used to detect DIC,
evaluate how severe it is, and monitor effects
over time. Many factors are used to diagnose
DIC. They include signs and symptoms,
presence of an underlying condition, physical
examination, and medical history.

Hemolysis is a
rupture or destruction
of red blood cells.

Nutritional tests

Nutritional tests

Haptoglobin

Haptoglobin is a protein that binds with
hemoglobin to help transport oxygen. A
haptoglobin test measures the amount of
haptoglobin in your blood.

Iron

An iron test may be performed if your doctor
suspects too little iron (deficiency) or too
much iron (overload). The test is performed by
drawing a blood sample and sending it to a lab
to be tested.

Indirect bilirubin

Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment created during
the breakdown of red blood cells. A bilirubin
test measures the levels of bilirubin in your
blood. Higher than normal results for indirect
bilirubin point to a diagnosis of hemolytic
anemia (red blood cells are destroyed faster
than they can be made).

Total iron-binding capacity

A total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) test is
used to see how well transferrin transports iron
through your blood. Transferrin moves iron
through the blood to various tissues such as
the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The TIBC
test determines whether there is too much
or too little of the transferrin protein in your
bloodstream.

Higher than normal levels of bilirubin may
indicate different types of liver or bile duct
problems. Occasionally, higher bilirubin
levels may be caused by an increased rate
of destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).
Hemolysis refers to when your body is getting
rid of too many red blood cells.

Ferritin

Ferritin is a protein in the blood that contains
iron. A ferritin test is used to find out how much
iron is stored in your body. If a ferritin test
result shows lower than normal results, you
may have iron deficiency.

Lactate dehydrogenase

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) helps to turn
sugar into energy. LDH is found in many of
the organs and tissues in the body, including
the liver, heart, pancreas, kidneys, skeletal
muscles, lymph tissue, and blood cells. An
LDH test is used to find out if you have any
tissue damage.

B12 and folate

Vitamin B12 and folate are nutrients only
found in the food you eat. Vitamin B12 and
folate tests measure vitamin levels in the liquid
portion of the blood (serum or plasma) to
detect deficiencies.

Hormone issues

Glomerular filtration rate

Hypogonadism

Glomeruli are tiny filters in the kidneys that
clean out waste from the blood. A glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) is a blood test used to
estimate how much blood passes through the
glomeruli each minute. Creatinine will also be
tested in the blood sample. Creatinine is waste
product created by a breakdown of creatine in
the muscles. Creatine is a chemical produced
by the body that helps to supply energy to
muscles.

Hypogonadism is a condition that affects
both males (gonads/testes) and women
(ovaries). During this condition, the body
does not produce enough of the hormone
(testosterone for men or estrogen for women).
Testosterone helps to regulate fertility, muscle
mass, fat distribution, and red blood cell
production. Estrogen helps to develop and
maintain the female reproductive system and
characteristics, such as breasts and pubic
hair. Treatment for hypogonadism may include

Adrenal dysfunction

Adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease)
refers to a disorder that occurs when your
adrenal glands do not produce enough
hormones (cortisol and aldosterone). Your
adrenal glands are located above the kidneys.
Cortisol is released by the adrenal glands to
help support your body to deal with stressful
situations. Aldosterone helps to balance
sodium and potassium in your blood. Too
much aldosterone can cause you to lose
potassium and retain sodium.
Tests used to measure the levels of cortisol
and aldosterone in your body include:

A GFR is a blood test
that looks at how
well your kidneys are
working.

Hormone issues

Hyperthyroidism

Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disorder
that causes hyperthyroidism, or overactive
thyroid. With this disease, your immune
system attacks the thyroid and causes it to
make more thyroid hormone than your body
needs.

Hyperthyroidism occurs when your body
becomes overactive from producing too much
of the thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and
triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroxine supports
digestion, heart and muscle function, brain
development, and maintenance of bones.
Triiodothyronine helps the body with important
functions such as growth and development,
metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate.

Hypothyroidism

During hypothyroidism, your thyroid gland
cannot make enough hormones to function
well. A slow production of hormones leads to a
slowing of your metabolism. A slow metabolism
will cause weight gain.

During hyperthyroidism, you may have a
fast heartbeat, increased appetite, anxiety,
sensitivity to heat, or sudden weight loss.

Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common
type of hypothyroidism. It refers to when your
body attacks its own immune system. This
attack causes the thyroid to stop producing
hormones, which leads to hypothyroidism.

Hyperthyroidism most commonly occurs in
three ways:


Thyroiditis



Thyroid nodule



Graves disease

Thyroiditis is caused by antibodies that attack
the thyroid. This leads to inflammation and
damage to the thyroid cells. Thyroiditis is
often caused by autoimmune diseases such
as juvenile diabetes (type-1) and rheumatoid
arthritis.
Thyroid nodules are found in both
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.
These nodules are often benign. Under
hyperthyroidism, nodules may increase your
thyroid’s size or produce too much T4 thyroid
hormone.

inflammation
C-reactive protein

Inflammation may
prevent your body
from using stored
iron to make enough
healthy red blood cells.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is found in blood
plasma. CRP increases when there’s
inflammation in your body. A CRP test is used
to check for inflammation. Inflammation is an
indication of infection or a chronic inflammatory
disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or
heart disease.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate

An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
is a blood test that measures how quickly
erythrocytes (red blood cells) settle at the
bottom of a test tube. Red blood cells normally
settle slowly. Inflammation is indicated by a
faster-than-normal rate.

An ESR test

Anemia

Overview

If you have anemia, your body’s cells
may not be receiving enough oxygen.
There are many forms of anemia, each
with its own cause and symptoms.
This chapter will provide information
on anemia caused by cancer or
chemotherapy treatment.

Anemia is a very common side effect of
chemotherapy. Anemia most often results in
fatigue and lightheadedness. If your anemia
is severe, you may be treated with a blood
transfusion, iron supplements, or medications
to stimulate red blood cell production (called
erythropoietin stimulating agents).
Fatigue is common with cancer. Anemia
may make fatigue worse. Anemia can also
impact your cancer treatment. Severe anemia
caused by chemotherapy may result in a
delay in treatments, or a need to reduce the
chemotherapy dose. Any delay in treatment
may cause it to be less effective.

Overview
Anemia is a condition where your body does
not make enough healthy red blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to your
cells. There are many types and causes
of anemia. Mild anemia is a common and
treatable condition that can occur in anyone.
Anemia may also be a sign of a more serious
condition. It may result from chronic bleeding
in the stomach, chronic inflammation from
an infection, kidney disease, cancer, or an
autoimmune disease.

Complete blood count with indices

A complete blood count (CBC) is used to
measure the number and physical makeup of
cells found in your blood. Your doctor will be
specifically interested in red blood cell levels
within the hematocrit and hemoglobin in your
blood. Hemoglobin is a protein in the red blood
cells. Hematocrit measures how much space
red blood cells take up in the blood. A low level
of either of these is a sign of anemia.

You will receive blood tests before and after
chemotherapy treatments to measure your red
blood cell count and hemoglobin. Blood tests
will provide information on size and number of
cells. These tests can help further define your
anemia.
For a list of additional tests for anemia, see



Hemoglobin amount in each red blood cell



The amount of hemoglobin compared to

Treatment depends on the type of anemia and
the cause. Iron supplements may be used to
treat iron deficiency. Vitamin B supplements
may be used for low vitamin levels. Blood
transfusions may be used for blood loss. And,
certain medications may be used to induce
blood creation.

If your CBC results indicate anemia, you may
need further testing.

Blood smear

Erythropoietic therapy

A blood smear is a blood test used to look for
abnormal blood cells. A smear test looks at
both your red and white blood cells. It helps
define the shape of red blood cells and the
presence of abnormal cells.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are
used to treat anemia due to chronic kidney
disease, chemotherapy, or certain treatments
for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).
ESAs can help reduce the need for blood
transfusions during chemotherapy treatment.
ESAs stimulate the bone marrow to make
more red blood cells. Epoetin alfa (Procrit® and
Epogen®) and darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®) are
examples of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

Reticulocyte count

A reticulocyte count test measures the number
of young red blood cells in the blood. The test
shows whether your bone marrow is making
red blood cells at the correct rate. This test
helps to determine the cause and type of
anemia.

You may receive ESA treatment if you have
anemia and any of the following:

Mean corpuscular volume

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) measures
the average size of red blood cells. This test is
especially helpful in identifying iron-deficiency
anemia (too little iron), as red blood cells are
smaller than normal.
There are many types and causes of anemia
in addition to chemotherapy. Further testing
may be needed to identify what is causing the
anemia.

Red blood cell transfusion

Transfusions

The fastest way to increase red blood cells
is with a red blood cell transfusion (blood
transfusion). A blood transfusion is a routine
procedure where donated blood is given to
you through a vein in your arm.

A transfusion is a common procedure to replace
blood or blood components (red blood cells
or platelets). It is given to you through an
intravenous line (IV), a tiny tube that is inserted
into a vein with a small needle.

A blood transfusion typically takes 1 to 4
hours, depending on how much is needed
and what part of the blood you need. You
should expect to receive regular blood tests
to check your blood counts. In some cases,
you may need to get more than one blood
transfusion.
Before your first blood transfusion, you will
be evaluated for the severity of your anemia.
If you are not experiencing symptoms and
do not have other major health issues, no
treatment is necessary. Your doctor will re-test
your blood at various times during treatment.
If your red blood cell numbers continue
to decline due to recent chemotherapy
or radiation therapy, and you have no
other major health issues, your doctor will
recommend treatment with a red blood cell
transfusion. Before your blood transfusion,
you will be tested for any issues with your
heart, lungs, and brain.
If you have symptoms of anemia, you will be
tested for the following health concerns before
starting treatment:

Iron monitoring
Total iron-binding capacity

Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is used to
measure the amount of iron that can be bound
by proteins in the blood. Transferrins are
glycoproteins that support the movement of
iron through blood plasma.

Serum ferritin

Ferritin is a protein that stores iron and
releases it when necessary. A serum ferritin
test is considered the most accurate to
diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

Iron monitoring
Iron is important in maintaining body functions
such as producing hemoglobin, the molecule
in your blood that carries oxygen. Iron is also
necessary to maintain healthy cells, skin, hair,
and nails. If it is found that your iron levels
are low, your doctor may treat you with an
intravenous (IV) iron supplement. Side effects
caused by IV iron may include feeling flushed,
headaches, and joint or muscle aches days
after treatment.

Iron deficiency anemia is treated based on
your ferritin level and transferrin saturation
(absorption):

An iron panel is used to test for the level of
iron in your blood. Tests include serum iron
and serum ferritin tests. A total iron-binding
capacity test will also measure iron levels.



If you have an absolute iron deficiency,
you may be treated with an IV or oral
supplement.



If you have a functional iron deficiency
and are receiving erythropoiesisstimulating agents (ESAs), you may
receive an IV iron supplement with
erythropoietic therapy (ESAs).



If you may have a functional iron
deficiency, work with your doctor to
determine if any iron supplement is
needed.



If you do not have an iron deficiency, no
treatment will be provided.

Serum iron

Serum iron is a test that measures the amount
of iron that is bound to transferrin and serum
ferritin.

In all instances, you will receive routine blood
tests to check your iron levels.

Neutropenia

Overview | Causes

Neutropenia refers to a low white blood
count. A low number of white blood
cells leads to immunosuppression
(a reduced ability to fight infections).
Immunosuppression can be caused
by certain diseases or treatments like
chemotherapy or radiation. This chapter
presents an overview of neutropenia.

Neutropenia is common after receiving
chemotherapy. This is because chemotherapy
kills cancer cells as well as healthy white blood
cells. As a result, you will be at increased risk
for infections.
Most people are not aware that they have
neutropenia. People often find out when they
have a blood test performed for other reasons.
If the neutropenia is severe, even bacteria
normally found in your mouth and intestines
can cause serious illness.

Overview
Neutropenia describes a low number of white
blood cells called neutrophils. Neutrophils are
made in the bone marrow. Neutrophils (a type
of white blood cell) are important in fighting
infection in the body. Neutrophils make up
approximately 40 percent (40%) to 60 percent
(60%) of the white blood cells in our bodies.

Causes
Neutropenia occurs for a couple of reasons,
either neutrophils in the blood are used up
or destroyed faster than they can be made,
or the bone marrow does not make enough
neutrophils.

Febrile neutropenia

Overview

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a serious
side effect of chemotherapy that
may result in delays in treatment or
reductions in chemotherapy doses.
Febrile neutropenia occurs when a
person with neutropenia (very low white
blood cell count) develops a fever. This
chapter presents an overview of febrile
neutropenia.

Signs of infection may include the following:

Overview
Neutropenia refers to a decrease in the
number of white blood cells. White blood cells
are the body’s main defense against infection.
When neutropenia is combined with a fever,
it is called febrile neutropenia (FN). This can
be a severe complication of chemotherapy
treatment that may result in delays or dose
reductions of chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
normal cells. A side effect of chemotherapy is
that it can decrease the number of white blood
cells in your body. Having a low white blood
cell count weakens your immune system,
which leads to an increase in your risk of
infection.

Risk assessment

Dose-dense chemotherapy is given more
frequently than normally scheduled, with
less time between doses. The purpose of the
shortened time between doses is to kill as
much of the cancer cells as possible.

You will be evaluated for risk of developing
febrile neutropenia before your first
chemotherapy treatment and throughout your
chemotherapy treatments.
Evaluation for risk may include:


Cancer type



Dose and type of chemotherapy



Patient risk factors



Goal of cancer treatment

Standard-dose chemotherapy is given on a
regular schedule (such as monthly). Certain
combinations of chemotherapy drugs, even
if they are not high-dose or dose-dense can
increase the risk of severe neutropenia.

Patient risk factors
Patient risk factors will be considered when
deciding on the best course of treatment. Risk
factors for neutropenia complications include
age, other health concerns such as lung or
heart disease, and previous cancer treatments
received.

Cancer type
Your cancer type will be considered when
discussing your risk for neutropenia. For
example, neutropenia is a common side effect
in people with leukemia.
Dose and type of chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
normal cells. Your risk of febrile neutropenia
may be increased based on the dose of
chemotherapy or the chemotherapy regimen
(combination of drugs) you receive.

Goal of treatment
Work with your care team to define your
treatment goal. Your options will vary between
cure or palliative care. Palliative care refers to
relieving the side effects of chemotherapy or
radiation treatment.

Chemotherapy doses include:


High-dose chemotherapy



Dose-dense chemotherapy



Before starting chemotherapy, you will be
placed into a risk group based on your specific
risk factors. A risk factor is anything that
increases your chance of febrile neutropenia.

G-CSFs include the following:

Your risk for developing febrile neutropenia will

After your risk is determined, you will be
placed into one of the following risk groups:


Low



Intermediate



High

If you do not have any symptoms and have no
other major health issues, then you are at low
risk for febrile neutropenia. Prophylaxis is not
needed.
You will be re-evaluated for febrile neutropenia
after your first cycle of chemotherapy. If
your risk does not change after the first
cycle of chemotherapy, you will be tested for
any changes to your risk score after each
chemotherapy treatment.

A low risk means you have a less than 10
percent (10%) chance of developing febrile
neutropenia. Intermediate risk means you have
a 10 to 20 percent (10% to 20%) chance. If
you are at high risk, you have a more than 20
percent (20%) chance of developing it. More
information about each of these groups can be
found next.

Intermediate risk
If you have an intermediate risk for febrile
neutropenia, it refers to having one or more of
the following risk factors:

Prophylaxis treatment

Prophylaxis means to prevent and refers
to medications given before chemotherapy
starts. Prophylaxis treatment includes
the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating
factors (G-CSFs). G-CSFs stimulate the
development of granulocytes (white blood
cells). They are used to prevent complications

fever, it is called febrile neutropenia (FN).



Neutropenia is common after receiving
chemotherapy and increases your risk for
infections.



You will be evaluated for risk of
developing febrile neutropenia before
and throughout your chemotherapy
treatments.



Before starting chemotherapy, you will be
placed into a risk group based on specific
risk factors. A risk factor is anything
that increases your chance of febrile
neutropenia.

Thrombocytopenia

Overview

Overview



Platelets are an important part of blood.
Platelets work with proteins called clotting
factors to control bleeding inside our bodies
and on our skin. Platelets are made in your
bone marrow along with other kinds of blood
cells. They travel through your blood vessels
and stick together (clot) to stop bleeding when
needed.

Certain drugs such as heparin, certain
antibiotics, ethanol, anticancer drugs, and
quinine

Thrombocytopenia can last days to years
depending on its cause.
Symptoms of thrombocytopenia may include
any of the following:


Easy or excessive bruising (known as
purpura)



Bleeding from your gums, skin, or nose



Heavy menstrual bleeding

During thrombocytopenia, serious bleeding
can occur inside your body or underneath your
skin.



Excessive bleeding during or after birth or
surgery



Blood in urine or stool

There are many factors that can cause
thrombocytopenia, including:



Red or purple dots on your skin



Fatigue



Headaches



Enlarged spleen

When your blood has lower than normal
platelets, it is called thrombocytopenia.
Thrombocytopenia occurs when your immune
system attacks the platelets in your blood.



The bone marrow does not make enough
platelets (such as leukemia or blood
disorders)



Infection such as hepatitis C virus, human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or EpsteinBarr virus



Platelets become trapped in the
spleen (such as cirrhosis of the liver,
myelofibrosis, and Gaucher disease)



Red blood cell transfusions can thin
platelet numbers in the blood



The body may destroy or use up
platelets made in the bone marrow
(this occurs in many disorders including
immune thrombocytopenia, thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolyticuremic syndrome)

cells, which help to define blood cells that are
abnormal in shape or size (dysplasia).
A blood smear test may also be used to check
for blast cells in the bloodstream. Although
blast cells are normally found in the bone
marrow, in some cases of MDS, blast cells
may be found in the bloodstream.

Testing

Thrombocytopenia is common in people with
cancer. It can be caused by chemotherapy,
radiation treatment, or the disease itself. If
you are suspected of having chemotherapyinduced thrombocytopenia (CIT), you will
be tested to determine the cause. Required
testing will include a complete blood count
(CBC) with differential for evaluation of other
cytopenias (one or more blood cell types are
lower than they should be) and blood smear
morphology, including checking for platelet
clumping.

Additional testing may be required to
determine treatment.

Treatment

Treatment for thrombocytopenia depends
on its cause and severity. If you do not have
chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia
(CIT), you will be treated for the cause of low
platelets as determined from the tests.

Complete blood count
A CBC measures the levels of red blood cells,
white blood cells, and platelets in your blood.
Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your
body, white blood cells fight infection, and
platelets control bleeding. A CBC looks for
many illnesses including anemia, infections,
and leukemia.

If you are found to have CIT, you can expect to
be treated with one or more of the following:

Differential
There are 5 types of white blood cells:
neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,
eosinophils, and basophils. A differential
counts the number of each type of white blood
cell (WBC). It also checks if the counts are in
balance with each other. Your doctor may be
able to determine the cause of an abnormal
white blood cell count from this test.

Platelet transfusion

Reduction in chemotherapy dose or
change in treatment



Platelet transfusion
You may receive a platelet transfusion if your
platelet count is low. During a transfusion,
platelets are given through an intravenous (IV)
drip into your vein. The platelets will be from
one or more donors. A platelet transfusion is
used to stop or prevent bleeding in someone
with thrombocytopenia. The transfusion
normally takes about 15 to 30 minutes to
complete. You can expect an immediate
increase in the number of platelets in your
blood after a transfusion.

Blood smear
In a blood smear test, a drop of blood is
placed on a slide so it can be viewed with
a microscope. A pathologist will look at cell
size, shape, type, and maturity. This test is
also used to count the different types of blood

Thrombocytopenia

After a stem cell transplant

After a stem cell transplant

For some, however, the effects may only be
temporary and more transfusions may be
needed.

Testing

Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) (also
referred to as bone marrow transplant or stem
cell transplant), destroys cells in the bone
marrow and replaces them with new, healthy
blood cells. These blood-forming cells are
called blood stem cells or hematopoietic stem
cells.

Chemotherapy dose reduction or change in
treatment
If your chemotherapy treatment is causing
issues with low platelet count, your treatment
may be reduced or changed. You will want
to weigh the pros and cons of changing or
delaying chemotherapy doses with your care
team.

The goal of an HCT is to cure cancer by
replacing unhealthy blood stem cells with
healthy ones. The transplanted healthy cells
may also recognize and attack cancer cells.

Clinical trial of thrombopoietin receptor
agonists
You may be asked to participate in a clinical
trial for thrombopoietin receptor agonists
(TPO-RAs). TPO-RAs have shown success in
increasing platelet counts, decreasing bleeding
events, and reducing the need for rescue
treatments. Rescue treatments are treatments
given when you do not respond to standard
therapy.

This is done by first suppressing the normal
stem cells and cancer cells with chemotherapy.
Then, healthy stem cells from another person
are infused. The healthy stem cells will expand
to form new cells, and potentially attack any
remaining cancer cells.
If you have thrombocytopenia after a
hematopoietic cell transplant, you will be
tested for the following:

Romiplostim
Romiplostim (Nplate®) is an injection drug. It
is used to increase the number of platelets
(cells that help the blood to clot) to decrease
the risk of bleeding. It is a granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). A G-CSF
stimulates the bone marrow to make more
stem cells.

G-CSF

Myeloid growth factors (MGFs) such as
granulocyte colony-stimulating factors
(G-CSFs) are used to reduce the
occurrence of febrile neutropenia (FN)
in those receiving myelosuppressive
chemotherapy.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors
(G-CSFs) stimulate the development of
granulocytes (white blood cells). They are
used to prevent febrile neutropenia when
you receive myelosuppressive cancer
chemotherapy or to reduce neutropenia
associated with a bone marrow transplant.

Myeloid growth factors (MGFs) help to
stimulate the body to produce certain cells.
MGFs are naturally made in the body, or
they can be made in a lab. They are used to
increase the number of blood cells and prevent
infections.

G-CSFs include the following:

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors

G-CSF

How it works

G-CSFs stimulate bone marrow to produce
more white blood cells. White blood cells
help to reduce the risk of infection after some
cancer treatments. G-CSF also helps to move
stem cells from bone marrow into the blood.
Stem cells are special cells that can develop
into different cell types including new red blood
cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

Keep a pain diary
A pain diary is a written record that helps you
keep track of when you have pain, how bad it
is, what causes it, and what makes it better or
worse. Use a pain diary to discuss your pain
with your care team. You might be referred to
a specialist for pain management.

G-CSFs are used before a stem cell transplant
to help stimulate the bone marrow to produce
more normal stem cells. Stem cells are
then collected and stored while you receive
high-dose chemotherapy. Since high-dose
chemotherapy stops bone marrow from
producing blood cells, the saved stem cells are
necessary to reboot the bone marrow to start
making different types of blood cells again.
The saved stem cells are infused back into the
bloodstream to help with the reboot.

Include in your pain diary:

Bone pain

Bone pain is a common side effect of G-CSFs.
It is not clear why. It may be due to the body’s
inflammatory response (immune system’s
response to an irritant).
Speak to your care team if you experience
bone pain. They may be able to prescribe
medication to relieve the pain.

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your doctor.

when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

Second opinion

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.
Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Questions to ask your doctors

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
If you take the time to build a relationship with
your doctor, it will help you feel supported
