About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas Version 3.2024 –
August 22, 2024.

Lymphoma is the most common type of blood
cancer. It affects the lymphatic system. The

of the body’s immune system. It is a germfighting network of tissues and organs that
includes the bone marrow, spleen, thymus,
lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels.

1 CTCL basics » Lymphocytes

As lymph travels throughout your body, it
passes through hundreds of small beanshaped structures called lymph nodes. Lymph
nodes make immune cells that help the body
fight infection. They also filter the lymph fluid
and remove foreign material such as bacteria
and cancer cells.

There are 3 main types of lymphocytes:




Lymphocytes



Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer
of lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type of
white blood cell that helps fight and prevent
infection. Lymphocytes are found in blood
and lymph tissue, and every organ in the
body. Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels
and lymph nodes. Lymphocytes normally
grow in response to infection or inflammation.
When they grow on their own without proper
regulation, they can develop into lymphoma.

T lymphocytes or T cells help kill
tumor cells and help control immune
responses.
Natural killer (NK) cells have
granules (small particles) with enzymes
that can kill tumor cells or cells infected
with a virus.

T cell
T lymphocytes or T cells are direct fighters
of foreign invaders and produce cytokines,
which help activate other parts of the immune
system. T cells destroy the body’s own cells
that have been taken over by viruses or that
have become cancerous. You have normal T
cells throughout your body, including in your
skin.

Lymphocytes
A lymphocyte is a type of
white blood cell. In primary
cutaneous lymphoma,
abnormal lymphocytes
cause skin lesions.

B lymphocytes or B cells make
antibodies. An antibody is a protein that
fights infection.

Primary cutaneous
lymphomas

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) develops
when abnormal T cells grow in the skin. These
abnormal cells can also grow in the blood,
lymph nodes, or other areas of the body, as
well as the skin. Although the skin is involved,
the skin cells themselves are not cancerous.

Primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCL) or
lymphomas of the skin are a rare group of
NHLs.
PCL is not a type of skin cancer. Skin cancer
develops from skin cells. PCL develops from
abnormal B or T lymphocytes.

On the skin, CTCL can cause rash-like
redness, slightly raised or scaly rough patches,
plaques (raised, flat-topped lesions), and
sometimes skin tumors. The lesions can be
itchy. Lesions may appear red, purple, or
brown, and can be lighter or darker in color
than the surrounding skin. It might show
up as more than one type of lesion and on
different parts of the skin (often in areas not
exposed to the sun). Some skin lymphomas
appear as a red rash over some or most of
the body (known as erythroderma). Most
CTCLs are slow growing (indolent) and not life
threatening. However, in a small number of
people, CTCL can progress to involve lymph
nodes, blood, and, in rare cases, internal
organs.

There are 2 types of PCL:


Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)



Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL)

This book will discuss treatment options for
CTCL. More information on CBCL can be
found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

CTCL is treatable, but generally not curable.
Most people with CTCL can live a long healthy
life with ongoing care and management.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary
syndrome (SS) (or simply referred to as
MF/SS)
Primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell
lymphoproliferative disorders (PCTLDs)

1 CTCL basics » Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

Mycosis fungoides

persistent, scaly plaque, commonly
involving the limbs.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common
form of CTCL. It starts in the skin, but in
advanced stages, MF can spread to the
lymph nodes, blood, or other organs such as
the spleen, liver, or lungs. MF is usually slow
growing (indolent) and appears as patches,
plaques, and tumors. A combination of
patches, plaques, and tumors with open sores
(ulceration) is possible. Symptoms include
rash and itchy skin.



Sézary syndrome
Sézary syndrome (SS) is a rare type of CTCL
closely related to MF but with its own unique
features. SS often causes skin redness
(erythema) over most of the body called
erythroderma. In SS, abnormal T cells called
Sézary cells are found in the skin and blood
and may cause swollen and enlarged lymph
nodes (lymphadenopathy). A characteristic of
Sézary cells is an abnormally shaped nucleus,
described as cerebriform. On the skin, SS
and MF can look alike. Blood tests are used
to tell the difference. For a person to have SS,
Sézary cells must be present in the blood.

There are several different types of MF:




Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides
(FMF) affects hair follicles. Lesions are
found in the head, eyebrow, or neck
area and often with follicular papules
and plaques. Loss of hair is common in
affected sites.
Pagetoid reticulosis (PR) or
Woringer-Kolopp disease is
characterized mostly by a single,

Granulomatous slack skin (GSS) is
a rare type of CTCL where bulky, hanging
skin folds are found in the armpit or groin.

CD30+ PCTLD
Primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell
lymphoproliferative disorders (PCTLDs) are a
group of diseases that include lymphomatoid
papulosis (LyP), cutaneous anaplastic large
cell lymphoma (ALCL), and borderline cases
with overlapping features. In PCTLD, T cells or
T lymphocytes that are CD30-positive (CD30+)
grow and cause skin lesions or nodules.
Typically, in PCTLD, more than 75 percent
(75%) of T cells are CD30+. This means that
at least 3 out of every 4 T cells have a protein
called CD30 on their surface (CD30+).

Those with lymphomas of
the skin should be treated at
centers experienced in this
type of cancer.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a
cancer that develops from lymphocytes,
a type of white blood cell. Primary
cutaneous lymphoma (PCL) is an NHL
found in the skin. It is not skin cancer.
Lymphocytes normally grow in response
to infection or inflammation. When
they grow on their own without proper
regulation, they can develop into
lymphoma. Lymphomas that develop on
the skin are called cutaneous lymphomas.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)
develops from T-cell lymphocytes. It often
appears as an itchy rash that can thicken
or form a tumor.
Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most
common form of CTCL. It starts in the
skin and can spread to blood and other
organs.
In Sézary syndrome (SS), cancerous T
cells called Sézary cells are found in the
skin, blood, and lymph nodes.
In primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell
lymphoproliferative disorders (PCTLDs),
T cells or T lymphocytes that are CD30positive (CD30+) grow and cause
skin lesions or nodules. Types include
lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), cutaneous
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL),
and borderline cases with overlapping
features.

testing. Accurate testing is needed


to diagnose and treat lymphomas
of the skin such as cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). This
chapter presents an overview of



possible tests you might receive
and what to expect.

Test results


The diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
(CTCL) is based mainly on a skin biopsy.
Examination of the blood can detect circulating
cancer cells and is part of diagnosing Sézary
syndrome (SS). Results of your physical exam,
blood tests, skin biopsy, and possible imaging
studies will determine your treatment plan. It
is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions about your test results.
Online patient portals are one way to access
your test results. Please wait to discuss the
results with your doctor or health care team.



Set up a MyChart or health record
account if it’s available, which can
help you track your appointments and
communicate with your care team. In
many places the MyChart or portal
messages are not immediately seen by
a nurse or physician, so ask your care
team how best to communicate with them,
especially in an emergency.

Guide 1.

It's beneficial to have a support system
in place during diagnosis and treatment.
Enlist the help of friends, family members,
or peers who can provide transportation,
meals, and emotional support. These can
be different people for different tasks or
change over time.
Consider bringing someone with you to
doctor visits if possible, or have someone

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

Organize your medical documents,
including insurance forms, medical
records, and test results. Keep a list of
contact information for your care team
and update your primary care physician
(PCP) regarding any changes. Include
details about the specific type of cancer,
treatment, and dates in your contact list.

For possible tests and procedures, see

Keep these things in mind:


Don’t hesitate to ask questions and take
notes during appointments. Write down
questions and ask a friend or family
member to take notes. Caregivers should
ask questions, too.

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

2 Testing for CTCL » Skin exam

Skin exam

Does the area itch or burn? Is it dry? Is it red
or warm to the touch? Are there bumps or a
raised, smooth area? Is there an odor? Share
any photos.

A dermatologist is an expert in the skin and
diseases of the skin. It is important to find a
dermatologist experienced in lymphomas of
the skin to conduct a skin exam. A complete
skin exam looks for signs of CTCL. CTCL
might appear as a rash, lumps, bumps, or
tumor. A rash is an area of irritated or swollen
skin. Many rashes are itchy, red, and painful.

Skin lesions
Skin is the largest organ in your body. A skin
lesion is a change in color or texture in an
area of the skin. Some words to describe skin
lesions include patch, papule, plaque, nodule,
tumor, and erythroderma.

The amount of cancer is measured using
the size of your hand. One hand is equal to
1 percent (1%) of your total body surface
area (BSA). In addition, any tumors will be
measured by their depth, height, size, and
region of the body. Keeping a photo journal
might help track your skin changes over time.
You know your skin better than anyone. Tell
your doctor about your normal skin color. Show
the differences in where the skin looks normal
and different to you. Describe any changes.

Skin lesions
A papule is a very small,
solid bump. A plaque
is a raised or hardened
lesion that forms on the
skin, larger than a papule.
Plaques sometimes become
tumors on the skin.

2 Testing for CTCL » Fertility (all genders)

Patch

Keeping a photo journal might
help track skin changes over
time.

A patch is a flat, thin, pink or red lesion of
any size that forms on the skin. Patches
may be dry, scaly, and itchy, and may look
like eczema or psoriasis. They can be lighter
than surrounding skin or brown in people with
darker skin. The patches may sometimes
become plaques (hard, raised lesions) on the
skin.

Tumor
A tumor is a firm, dome-shaped mass at least
1 centimeter in size.

Papule
A papule is a very small, solid lump that might
look like a very small pimple. Usually, papules
are found in groups. Papules may be red,
purple, brown, or pink.

Ulcer
A skin ulcer is an open sore or wound on the
skin.

Plaque

Fertility (all genders)

A plaque is a raised (elevated) or hardened
(indurated) lesion of any size that forms on the
skin. Plaques may be red, scaly, and itchy, and
may look like eczema or psoriasis. Plaques
sometimes become tumors on the skin.

Some types of treatment can impact your
fertility, the ability to have children. If you think
you want children in the future, ask your care
team how cancer and cancer treatment might
change your fertility. To preserve your fertility,
you may need to take action before starting
cancer treatment. Those who want to have
children in the future should be referred to a
fertility specialist to discuss the options before
starting treatment.

Papulonodular
Papulonodular is a combination of papules and
nodules found on the skin. Nodules are raised
higher on the skin than papules.

Erythroderma

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t sure at the
moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists
can help you sort through what may be best for
your situation.

Erythroderma is redness of over 80% of
the body’s skin surface. It is an important
part of recognizing and treating mycosis
fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS).
Erythroderma can look like sunburn or large
blotches on the skin.

2 Testing for CTCL » Blood tests

HTLV

More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) testing
is used to detect an HTLV infection that could
be the cause of a T-cell lymphoma. In the
United States, all donated blood is screened
for HTLV.

Lactate dehydrogenase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is a protein found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into the blood.
Fast-growing cells also release LDH and
cause levels of this protein to be elevated in
the blood.

Blood tests
Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into a vein in your
arm.

Pregnancy test
If planned treatment might affect pregnancy,
then those who can become pregnant will
be given a pregnancy test before treatment
begins.

Complete blood count and
differential
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your
blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a picture
of your overall health. A differential counts the
number of each type of WBC (neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and
basophils). It also checks if the counts are in
balance with each other.

Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures substances in your blood. A CMP
provides important information about how well
your kidneys and liver are working, among
other things.

2 Testing for CTCL » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

MRI scan
An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body to look for cancer deposits. A
radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report
to your doctor. While these reports might be
available to you through your patient portal or
patient access system, please wait to discuss
these results with your care team.

Contrast material

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are substances that help enhance
and improve the images of several organs
and structures in the body. It is used to make
the pictures clearer. The contrast is not
permanent and will leave your body in your
urine immediately after the test. The types of
contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI.

PET scan

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

A PET (positron emission tomography) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans. However, not all tumors will
appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright
spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain,
heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on
PET. Inflammation or infection can also show
up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

CT scan
A CT or CAT (computed tomography) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your head,
neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis may be one
of the tests to look for cancer. In most cases,
contrast will be used.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

X-ray
An x-ray is a type of radiation. In small doses,
it is used to make pictures of the inside of the
body. It might be referred to as a radiograph.
17

2 Testing for CTCL » Biopsy

Biopsy

Skin lesion biopsy
A sample of your lesion will be removed and
tested to confirm a diagnosis of lymphoma of
the skin. A skin lesion biopsy can be incisional
or excisional. An incisional biopsy removes
an area of skin using a scalpel blade. Stitches
are usually required after an incisional biopsy.
An excisional biopsy usually removes a larger
area of skin and is done infrequently in CTCL.

A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue
such as skin. A biopsy is needed to diagnose
CTCL. Your sample should be reviewed by a
pathologist who is an expert in the diagnosis
of lymphomas of the skin. The pathologist will
review thin sections of the skin biopsy under
a microscope. This review is often referred
to as histology or histopathology review. The
pathologist will note the overall appearance
and the size, shape, and type of your cells.

Skin punch biopsy
In a skin punch biopsy, a small sample of skin
and connective tissue are removed using a
hand-held tool. Stitches are often used to close
the opening in the skin.

Histology is the study of the anatomy
(structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under
a microscope.
A biopsy is an important part of a correct
CTCL diagnosis. Diagnosing CTCL can be a
challenge. It is common to have several skin
biopsies in order to make a clear diagnosis.

Seek out support groups
at your local hospital,
through social media,
or from those listed
in the back of this
book. Look to friends,
relatives, neighbors, and
coworkers for social
support.

2 Testing for CTCL » Immunophenotyping

Skin shave biopsy

bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe.
For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to
remove a small piece of the bone. You may
feel bone pain in your hip for a few days. Your
skin may bruise.

A skin shave biopsy removes the top layer
of skin using a tool like a razor. This type of
biopsy may not be recommended because it
doesn’t take a deep enough sample. Abnormal
lymphocytes are often found under the surface
of the skin.

Immunophenotyping

Lymph node biopsy

Immunophenotyping is a process that uses
antibodies to detect the presence or absence
of antigens. Antigens are proteins or markers
that can be found on the surface of or inside
white blood cells such as T cells. Specific
groupings of antigens are normal. However,
some specific patterns of antigens are found
on abnormal cells.

Lymph nodes are usually too small to be
seen or felt. Sometimes, lymph nodes can
feel swollen, enlarged, hard to the touch, or
don’t move when pushed (fixed or immobile).
A lymph node biopsy can be done using a
needle biopsy procedure or as a small surgery
to remove (excise) a lymph node.

Immunophenotyping can be done
using specialized techniques called
immunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow cytometry.
These techniques are used to distinguish
CTCL from other types of lymphoma.
Immunophenotype can change as cancer
progresses.

Bone marrow tests
Bone marrow tests might be done in some
cases.
There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that
are often done at the same time:


Bone marrow aspirate



Bone marrow biopsy



Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding
liquid and cells. An aspirate takes some of the
liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy
takes a piece of the sponge.


For many, this is an uncomfortable procedure.
Your care team will try to make you as
comfortable as possible. The samples are
usually taken from the back of the hip bone
(pelvis). You will likely lie on your belly or side.
For an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed

Mycosis fungoides (MF) and
Sézary syndrome (SS) cells are
typically characterized by the following
immunophenotype: CD2+, CD3+, CD5+,
CD4+, CD8- (rarely CD8+ and CD4-), and
they lack certain T-cell markers, such as
CD7 and CD26.
Primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder
(PCTLD) cells are CD30-positive
(CD30+).

Testing for CTCL biomarker
and genetic changes

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to immune cells. The cells are
then studied using a microscope. IHC looks
for the immunophenotype of cells from a skin
biopsy.

Biomarker and genetic tests are used to
learn more about your type of CTCL, to guide
treatment, and to determine the likely path
your cancer will take (prognosis). This genetic
testing is different from family history genetic
testing or genetic cancer risk testing. This
testing looks for changes only in the CTCL
cells that have developed over time, and not
changes in the rest of your body’s cells.

CD4 and CD8 are proteins that are on two
families of T lymphocytes. CD4 T cells (helper
cells) help regulate functions of the immune
system. CD8 T cells (killer cells) break down or
rid the body of foreign substances. Most cases
of CTCL come from CD4 T cells. An IHC will
look for these cells and others. An IHC panel
of skin biopsy may include testing for CD2,
CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD20, and CD30.
Others might be included.

Inside our cells are DNA molecules. These
molecules are tightly packaged into what
is called a chromosome. Chromosomes
contain most of the genetic information in a
cell. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
Each chromosome contains thousands of
genes. Genes are coded instructions for the
proteins your cells make. A mutation is when
something goes wrong in the genetic code.
Proteins are written like this: CD4. Genes are
written with italics like this: TCR. When a gene
or protein is found (expressed), it is shown with
a plus sign (+) like this: CD4+. When a gene or
protein has not been found, it is written with a
negative sign (-) like this CD4-.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry is a laboratory method used
to detect, identify, and count specific cells.
Flow cytometry involves adding a lightsensitive dye to cells. The dyed cells are
passed through a beam of light in a machine.
The machine measures the number of
cells, things like the size and shape of the
cells, and other unique features of the cells.
Flow cytometry may be used on cells from
circulating (peripheral) blood, bone marrow,
or a biopsy. The most common use of flow
cytometry is in the identification of markers on
cells, particularly in the immune system (called
immunophenotyping). In CTCL, flow cytometry
is often used to count the number of Sézary
cells or CTCL cells in the blood.

CTCL mutation testing
A sample of your skin, lymph node, blood,
or bone marrow might be used to see if the
cancer cells have any specific mutations.
Some mutations can be targeted with specific
therapies. This is separate from the genetic
testing for mutations that you may have
inherited from your biological parents.
CTCL cells can have changes in genes
and chromosomes. Some mutations may

Gene rearrangements

determine the type of treatment given. Subtle
new drug-resistant mutations may occur
over time. Mutations can also happen during
treatment. Mutation testing is used to look for
these new mutations. Some mutations lead to
resistance to certain targeted therapies. There
are many possible mutations. Ask your care
team for more information.

Normal T cells break their DNA in certain ways
to create diversity within your immune system.
In a tumor, all cancer cells are derived from the
same original cell. In CTCL that cell is a T cell.
When that one T cell divides many times, the
entire group of T cells is called clonal or the
tumor is described as having clonality. Clonal
T cells should have the same T-cell receptor
and the same T-cell receptor gene sequence.
Pathologists have tests to determine if a group
of cells is clonal or not. This is commonly
described as TCR.

FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. Since
this test doesn’t need growing cells, it can be
performed on a blood sample.

Biomarker and genetic testing is used to detect
T-cell rearrangements commonly found in
CTCL. This information can be helpful when
diagnosing and treating CTCL. SS has a clonal
rearrangement of TCR in the blood.

FISH can find translocations that are too small
to be seen with other methods. A translocation
occurs when parts of two chromosomes switch
with one another. However, FISH can only
be used for known changes. It cannot detect
all the possible changes found within the
chromosomes or genes. For example, FISH
is used to detect TP63 gene rearrangements
by attaching probes to TP63 (3q28) and
TBL1XR1/TP63.

Skin lesions can appear anywhere on
the body. Lesions may look like papules,
patches, plaques, or nodules.
A biopsy is needed to diagnose
lymphomas of the skin such as cutaneous
T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs). Your biopsy
should be reviewed by a pathologist who
is an expert in the diagnosis of CTCL.
A sample from your biopsy may undergo



decisions. Cancer staging for
mycosis fungoides (MF)/Sézary



syndrome (SS) is different than
for other lymphomas of the skin.



Although the same staging system
is used, MF and SS are treated
differently.

B is for blood – This refers to if
abnormal T lymphocytes are found in
circulating (peripheral) blood.

In MF/SS, the amount of cancer is measured
by evaluating what percent of your skin is
affected by lymphoma. One hand is equal
to 1 percent (1%) of your total body surface
area (BSA). In addition, any tumors will be
measured by their depth, height, size, and
region of the body. Tumors are often measured
in centimeters (cm).

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage many cancers. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different areas
of cancer growth. Based on biopsy and other
test results, each letter will be assigned a
score or number. The higher the number, the
larger the tumor or the more the cancer has
spread to lymph nodes or other organs. These
scores will be combined to assign the cancer
a stage. A TNM example might look like this:
T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M0.





Staging in MF/SS looks slightly different than
in other cancers. It is referred to as TNMB or
tumor, node, metastasis, blood.



T is for skin – In mycosis fungoides/
Sézary syndrome (MF/SS), tumor refers
to type and number of tumors covering
the skin. Staging looks for the presence

3 MF and SS cancer staging » TNMB scores

N = Node

M = Metastasis

There are hundreds of lymph nodes throughout
your body. Lymph nodes work as filters to
help fight infection and remove harmful things.
They also produce lymphocytes. As abnormal
T lymphocytes multiply, they can distort or
overtake the lymph node.

Cancer that has spread to distant parts of the
body is usually called metastatic. It is shown
as M1. In MF/SS, cancer can spread to bone
marrow or visceral (internal, solid) organs such
as the spleen, liver, or lungs.


Abnormal lymph nodes are any that can
be felt on physical exam as firm, irregular,
clustered, fixed, or 1.5 cm or more in diameter.
Node groups examined on physical exam
include neck (cervical), above the collarbone
(supraclavicular), arm (epitrochlear), armpit
(axillary), and groin (inguinal).

B = Blood

N0 means that there are no abnormal T
lymphocytes found in lymph nodes.

Peripheral blood circulates throughout your
body (bloodstream). The amount of abnormal
T cells found in the blood will be measured.

N1 means that there are some abnormal
T lymphocytes found in lymph nodes.
N2 means that there are many abnormal
T lymphocytes or clusters found in lymph
nodes.



N3 means that abnormal T lymphocytes
have altered the structure of lymph nodes.
This is called lymph node (nodal) disease.

B0 (no or very low blood
involvement) – No blood involvement or
very small amounts (less than 5% or 250
cells/mm3) of CD4+/CD26- or CD4+/CD7Sézary cells are found in the blood.
B1 (low blood tumor burden) –
More than 5% but less than 1000/µL of
peripheral (circulating) blood lymphocytes
are Sézary cells.
B2 (high blood tumor burden) – More
than 1000/µL Sézary cells are found. A
diagnosis of SS requires B2 involvement.

Treating cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.

treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding at the time of your cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.

Cancer and cancer treatment can affect the
ovaries and damage sperm. If you become
pregnant during chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or other types of systemic therapy,
serious birth defects can occur. Speak with
your care team about preventing pregnancy
while being treated for cancer. Hormonal birth
control may or may not be recommended,
so ask your doctor about options such as
intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier
methods. Types of barrier methods include
condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the
contraceptive sponge.

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
period may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is

4 Treating CTCL » Skin-directed therapy

Skin-directed therapy

Local radiation therapy
Local radiation therapy (RT) treats the skin
lesion. Involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT)
is a type of local radiation. It can be used on
lymph nodes and/or skin lesions. The type of
radiation is usually electrons. Some with CTCL
may see a benefit with low doses of radiation.

Types of therapy focused on the skin
include topical therapy, local radiation, and
phototherapy.

Topical therapy
A topical treatment is put on the surface of
the skin. It might be a lotion (cream), gel,
or ointment. Types of topical therapy are
described next.










Phototherapy
Phototherapy uses different ultraviolet (UV)
light wavelengths to treat skin lesions or
tumors.

Corticosteroids (steroids) are used
to reduce inflammation. Steroids can be
topical or intralesional. An intralesional
steroid is injected directly into a lesion on
or just below the skin.

Types include:


Imiquimod is used to treat certain types
of flat, scaly growths on the skin. Brand
names include Aldara and Zyclara.



Nitrogen mustard
(mechlorethamine hydrochloride)
stops or slows the growth of cancer.
Brand names include Valchlor and
Ledaga.



Retinoids are products related to
vitamin A. Examples include bexarotene
(Targretin gel) and tazarotene (Tazorac
Gel, Tazorac Cream).



Carmustine is a chemotherapy that
stops or slows the growth of cancer.
Topical carmustine (BiCNU) is applied to
lesions.

Ultraviolet B (UVB) – exposes the skin
to an artificial UVB light source for a set
length of time on a regular schedule.
Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)
– uses a very specific UV wavelength.
Photochemotherapy or psoralen
plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) – combines
psoralen (P) with UVA. Psoralen is a type
of medicine taken by mouth (orally) that
causes your skin to be sensitive to light.
After taking psoralen, the skin is exposed
to long-wave UV light.
Ultraviolet A1 (UVA1) – penetrates
deep into the skin causing T cells to die.

Often, UVB or NB-UVB is used for patch or
thin plaques and PUVA or UVA1 is used for
thicker plaques or tumors.
UV can increase your risk of some skin
cancers. Phototherapy may not be favored
in those with a history of skin cancer, or who
have had melanoma.

4 Treating CTCL » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, electrons, and
other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink
tumors. RT can be given alone or with other
treatments. Treatment may focus on individual
tumors, a small area/region of the body, the
entire surface of the skin, or specific lymph
nodes. RT may be used as supportive care or
palliative care to help ease pain or discomfort
caused by cancer. RT in CTCL often involves
use of electrons which only affects tissues a
couple millimeters deep.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

EBRT

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s) or areas of the body.
The most common types of EBRT that may be
used to treat CTCL include:




Involved-site radiation therapy
(ISRT) targets a specific area of skin. It
can also be used to treat specific lymph
nodes with cancer.



Turmeric



Ginkgo biloba



Green tea extract



St. John’s Wort



Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care
medicines given during systemic therapy.
Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.

Total skin electron beam therapy
(TSEBT) treats the entire skin surface.
You might stand on a rotating platform to
receive this treatment.

4 Treating CTCL » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

The goal of treatment is to improve
your condition and to maintain
this improvement for as long as
possible.

Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
It includes retinoids, chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy
might be used alone or with other therapies.

Extracorporeal photopheresis
Photopheresis, also known as extracorporeal
photopheresis (ECP), is a medical treatment
that removes blood from the body using a
machine. The machine separates out the white
blood cells. These white cells are exposed to
a medicine called 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP)
followed by ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation. Then
the blood with the treated white blood cells is
returned to your body.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop the action
of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/
or survive.

Immunotherapy

Chemotherapy

Immunotherapy is a drug therapy that
increases the activity of your immune system.
By doing so, it improves your body’s ability to
find and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy
can be given alone or with other types of
treatment.

Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
normal cells. There are many chemotherapies
used to treat primary cutaneous lymphomas.

Retinoids
Retinoids are products related to vitamin A
that can stop the growth of cancer cells. When
taken by mouth (orally), they work throughout
the body.

4 Treating CTCL » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, lab
tests, or general health. These requirements
ensure that participants are alike in specific
ways and that the trial is as safe as possible
for the participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
It depends on the study, your health insurance,
and the state in which you live. In general,
procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered
standard of care will be billed to you or
your insurance, whereas those considered
research are covered by the trial sponsor. Your
treatment team and the research team can
help determine if you are responsible for any
costs.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

4 Treating CTCL » Hematopoietic cell transplant

Hematopoietic cell
transplant

After conditioning, you will receive a
transfusion of the healthy stem cells from a
donor matched to you. A transfusion is a slow
injection of blood products into a vein. This
can take several hours. The transplanted
stem cells will travel to your bone marrow
and grow. New, healthy blood cells will form.
This is called engraftment. It usually takes
about 2 to 4 weeks. Until then, you will have
little or no immune defense. You may need to
stay in a very clean room at the hospital or be
given antibiotics to prevent or treat infection.
Transfusions are also possible. A red blood cell
transfusion is used to prevent bleeding and
to treat anemia (below normal red blood cell
count). A platelet transfusion is used to treat
a low platelet count or bleeding. While waiting
for the cells to engraft, you will likely feel tired
and weak.

A hematopoietic stem cell is an immature cell
that can develop into any type of blood cell. A
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) replaces
hematopoietic stem cells that have been
destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/
or radiation therapy as part of the transplant
process. You might hear it called a stem cell
transplant (SCT) or a bone marrow transplant
(BMT). This book will refer to it as HCT. HCTs
are performed in specialized centers.
There are 2 types of HCT:



Autologous – stem cells come from you
Allogeneic – stem cells come from a
donor who may or may not be related to
you

The goal of the transplant is for the new
immune system to recognize what remains
of the CTCL as foreign and destroy it and to
provide you with new, healthy bone marrow.

In some cases, an allogeneic HCT is a
treatment option. It is used to cure MF/SS. The
steps of an allogeneic HCT are described next.

Possible side effects

Allogeneic transplant

Every treatment has side effects. You will be
monitored for infections, decreases in your
blood counts that require blood transfusions,
disease relapse, and graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD). In GVHD, the donor cells attack your
normal, healthy tissue. There are treatments
for GVHD. Ask your care team about the
possible side effects or complications of HCT
and how this might affect your quality of life.

An allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(allogeneic HCT) uses healthy stem cells
from a donor. The donor may or may not be
related to you. Before an HCT, treatment is
needed to destroy bone marrow cells. This is
called conditioning and it creates room for the
healthy donor stem cells and eliminates any
remaining lymphoma cells. Your blood will be
in a weakened state after conditioning until
the donor stem cells settle in and take over
as your new blood supply. Conditioning also
weakens the immune system so your body
won’t kill the transplanted cells. Chemotherapy
and/or radiation is used for conditioning.

4 Treating CTCL » General supportive care

General supportive care

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social health
issues, and second cancers. The sooner late
effects are treated the better. Ask your care
team about what late effects could occur. This
will help you know what to look for.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Supportive care might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you are
feeling and about any side effects so they can
be managed. Supportive care, best supportive
care, and palliative care often mean the same
thing.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

A personalized survivorship care plan will
contain a summary of possible long-term
effects of treatment called late effects and list
follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care
provider will coordinate with specialists for your
follow-up care.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

5 Mycosis fungoides » Stage 1A

Stage 1A

Mycosis fungoides is a chronic
disease that starts in the skin, but

In stage 1A, cancer is limited to a small area
on the skin (T1). The amount of cancer is
measured by evaluating what percent of your
skin is affected by lymphoma. One hand is
equal to 1 percent (1%) of your total body
surface area (BSA). In stage 1A, less than
10% of the skin (BSA) is covered in patches,
papules, and/or plaques.

in advanced stages can spread
to the lymph nodes, blood, or
other organs. Depending on the
cancer stage, treatment might
be a skin-directed therapy or a
combination of systemic therapy

Primary treatment

with skin-directed therapy. The

Primary treatment is the first treatment given.
Treatment options focus on skin-directed
therapies. These therapies may be used alone
or with other skin-directed therapies or with
systemic (drug) therapy. Preferred systemic
therapy options include bexarotene (Targretin),
interferon, or methotrexate.

goal of treatment is to improve
your condition and to maintain
this improvement for as long as
possible. Together, you and your
care team will choose a treatment
plan that is best for you.



The goal of treatment is to improve your
condition and to maintain this improvement
for as long as possible. Treatment will be
based on the cancer stage, if any and what
treatments were given before, and other
factors. If cancer in the blood (B1 involvement)
is suspected, then treatment may follow stage
3 (erythrodermic disease).



A complete response (CR) is described
as remission or a disease-free period. In
order to maintain remission for as long
as possible, maintenance therapy is
often given. Maintenance therapy uses
the same treatment, but often at a lower
dose.
In a partial response (PR), treatment is
working, but cancer remains. You will
likely continue the same treatment until a
CR.

Relapse
When cancer returns after a disease-free
period, it is called a relapse. Relapse can
happen after a CR or PR. Treatment is based
on cancer stage.

5 Mycosis fungoides » Stage 1B and 2A

Stage 1B and 2A

Progression
Disease progression is cancer that is growing
or spreading. If cancer progresses higher than
stage 1A, then treatment is based on the new
stage.

In stage 1B, patches, papules, and/or plaques
cover 10% or more of the skin (T2). Cancer
is not found in lymph nodes (N0) or visceral
organs (M0).

Persistent

In stage 2A, any amount of the skin surface is
covered with patches or plaques (T1 or T2).
There is some involvement of lymph nodes,
but not enough to alter the structure of lymph
nodes (N1 or N2). If cancer is found in the
blood (B1), it might be treated as stage 3
erythrodermic disease.

T1 skin disease that persists, but has not
progressed, may be treated with a different
skin-directed therapy. Treatment aims to
reduce the amount of cancer before starting
treatment for refractory disease.

Refractory

Treatment for stage 1B and 2A is based on
the amount of skin disease called burden. The
lower the amount of skin disease, the lower the
skin disease burden.

When cancer appears resistant to multiple
therapies, it is called refractory. Treatment
might be systemic therapy with or without skindirected therapies as found in stage 1B and
2A, radiation therapy if not used before, or a
clinical trial.

Lower skin disease burden

Relapse

Lower skin disease burden is mostly patch
disease. A limited area of the skin is involved.
Treatment focuses on limited or local skindirected therapies. These therapies might be
used alone or in combination with other skindirected therapies or with systemic therapy.
For systemic therapy options, see Guide 3.

When cancer returns after a disease-free
period, it is called a relapse. Treatment will be
based on the cancer stage, what treatments
were given before, and other factors.

Progression
If cancer progresses to higher than stage
1B or 2A, then the cancer will be restaged.
Treatment will be based on the new stage.

Higher skin disease burden
Higher skin disease burden is mostly plaque
disease. The goal of treatment is to improve
your condition and to reduce the amount of
cancer burden.

Large cell transformation (LCT) occurs when
a specific group of mycosis fungoides (MF)

Relapse

If LCT is suspected, you might have a biopsy.
LCT is diagnosed when large cells are present
in more than 25 percent (25%) of tumor cells
in a skin lesion biopsy. This means that a large
cell is found in more than 1 out of every 4
tumor cells. Typically, mycosis fungoides (MF)
grows and progresses slowly, but sometimes
it transforms in LCT and may become more
aggressive. The goal of treatment is to slow
the growth of LCT.

When cancer returns after a disease-free
period, it is called a relapse. Treatment might
be the same as before, a clinical trial, or
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).
Treatment for MF will be based on cancer
stage.

Persistent
In LCT that persists, but has not progressed,
treatment will focus on reducing the amount of
cancer before starting treatment for refractory
disease.

Limited lesions with LCT
If there are a limited number of lesions with
LCT, the lesions might be treated with radiation
therapy (RT).

Refractory

Widespread lesions with LCT

When cancer appears resistant to multiple
therapies, it is called refractory. Treatment
might be clinical trial, systemic therapy, or
allogeneic HCT.

Treatment options for widespread skin lesions
with LCT include total skin electron beam
therapy (TSEBT) or systemic therapy with
skin-directed therapy. Systemic therapy will
help control LCT that is found in any organs
and skin lesions. Imaging and other tests might
be performed if disease is suspected in lymph
nodes and/or internal (visceral) organs.

Overview



Primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell
lymphoproliferative disorders (PCTLDs) are
a group of diseases that include cutaneous
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL),
lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), and borderline
cases with overlapping features. In PCTLD, a
protein called CD30 is found on the surface of
T cells. This is referred to as CD30-posiitve or
CD30+. These CD30+ cells grow out of control
(proliferate) and cause skin lesions or nodules.
Typically, in PCTLD, more than 75 percent
(75%) of T cells are CD30+. This means that
at least 3 out of every 4 T cells have a protein
called CD30 on their surface (CD30+).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

Primary cutaneous anaplastic
large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) is
defined by the presence of anaplastic
large cells. Lesions appear on the skin
as one or more raised, red lesions or
nodules. Anaplastic cells are fast-growing,
abnormal cells. PC-ALCL starts in the
skin and may spread to the lymph nodes.
Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is
a benign, chronic, recurring, self-healing
condition. Papulonodular skin lesions
appear on the skin as small bumps and
nodules.

In addition, a person can have both PCTLD
and mycosis fungoides (MF). MF or Sézary
syndrome (SS) that is CD30+ is not the same
as PCTLD. Sézary cells are typically CD30-.

7 CD30+ PCTLD » Primary cutaneous ALCL

Primary cutaneous ALCL

One or grouped lesions
Primary treatment is the first treatment.
Treatment aims to remove the lesion. This
can be achieved using involved-site radiation
therapy (ISRT), surgery (excision), or both.
ISRT is more common.

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) can
be found in the skin, the lymph nodes, or in
organs throughout the body. When ALCL
appears in the skin, it is called primary
cutaneous ALCL (PC-ALCL) or cutaneous
ALCL. PC-ALCL may also be found in a
nearby (regional) lymph node. Sometimes,
cutaneous ALCL can extend beyond the skin
and lymph nodes to organs. If this occurs, it is
usually treated as systemic ALCL.

After a response to treatment, you will be
monitored for recurrence. Recurrence or
relapse is the return of one or more lesions.
If a lesion returns and is confined to the
skin, then you can be retreated with ISRT,
surgery, or both. Sometimes, observation
(no treatment) is an option if the lesions are
not causing symptoms (asymptomatic). If no
response or lesions seem resistant (refractory)
to treatment, then you will be treated as
described below in multifocal lesions.

For treatment of systemic ALCL, see NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Peripheral T-Cell
Lymphoma at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Multifocal lesions
When there are lesions in multiple locations,
primary treatment focuses on systemic therapy
such as brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris). Other
systemic therapies might be given alone or
with skin-directed therapy.

Treatment
PC-ALCL is often a slowing-growing (indolent),
persistent disease with lesions that may go
away (regress). Lesions often return but seem
to respond well to treatment. Not everyone's
disease responds to treatment the same
way. Treatment for PC-ALCL is based on the
number of lesions and their location.

After a response to treatment, you will be
observed for recurrence. Recurrence or
relapse is the return of multifocal lesions.
If relapse, no response, or lesions seem
resistant (refractory) to treatment, then options
include:

PC-ALCL may involve the skin and nearby
(regional) lymph nodes. A lymph node biopsy
is needed to confirm disease. Treatment
aims to reduce the amount of skin lesions
and disease in lymph nodes. The preferred
treatment is brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris)
with or without involved-site radiation therapy
(ISRT) to lymph nodes and primary skin
lesions. Other systemic therapies might be
given.

LyP
Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a benign,
chronic, recurring disease of the immune
system. Lesions appear on the skin as small
bumps and nodules called papulonodular skin
lesions. LyP is a primary cutaneous CD30+
T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (PCTLD).
Lymphoproliferative disorders are often treated
like cancer, but they are not cancer.

After a response to treatment, you will be
observed for recurrence. Recurrence or
relapse is the return of disease. If relapse,
no response, or lesions seem resistant
(refractory) to treatment, then options include:

Without symptoms – An asymptomatic
person is without symptoms. Observation
is the preferred option for those with
limited lesions who are asymptomatic.
Topical steroids are also an option.

Monitoring
Those with LyP are at risk for developing
another type of lymphoma. Life-long follow-up
will be needed. Your doctor should conduct a
thorough skin exam during each follow-up visit.
Ask how you will be monitored and how often
you should have a check-up.

With symptoms – If you have limited
lesions with symptoms, treatment aims to
reduce symptoms. Topical steroids and
phototherapy are common. Observation is
also an option.
If disease is responding to

In primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell
lymphoproliferative disorders (PCTLDs),
T-cell lymphocytes that are CD30-positive
(CD30+) grow and cause skin lesions or
nodules.
Types of PCTLD include cutaneous
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL),
lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), and
borderline cases.
Diagnosis aims to distinguish between
cutaneous ALCL and LyP.
Cutaneous ALCL appears in the skin as
one or more raised lesions or nodules and
may be found in lymph nodes.
LyP is a benign (not cancer), chronic,
recurring disease of the immune system.
Treatment for LyP includes skin-directed
and/or systemic therapy. A clinical trial
may be an option.
A person can have both PCTLD and
mycosis fungoides (MF).

choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:




What you want and how that might differ
from what others want

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Your religious and spiritual beliefs

Support groups

Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.
