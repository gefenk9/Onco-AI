Nausea and vomiting basics

What causes nausea and vomiting?

Nausea and vomiting are common
but often preventable side effects of
cancer treatment. In other words, your
life doesn’t have to come to a complete
stop because you’re receiving cancer
medications. This chapter explains
the basics of nausea and vomiting,
and what you can do about these side
effects.

What causes nausea and
vomiting?
Nausea and vomiting are reflexes that
happen when your body wants to get rid of
harmful (toxic) substances in the intestine
and stomach. Nausea and vomiting can occur
together or separately.
This book is about nausea and vomiting
that comes from cancer treatments like
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This book
also explains what you need to know about
preventing nausea and vomiting.

Having cancer and undergoing cancer
treatment can be very stressful. You may feel
a wide range of emotions and discomforts.
Your care team wants to help you focus on
your treatment. But sometimes the side effects
caused by cancer treatment can overshadow
the treatment itself.

Medications used to prevent and treat nausea
and vomiting have come a long way over the
years. Today, nausea and vomiting can be
managed and even prevented. When they
can’t be prevented, there are other ways to
help you cope.

Nausea and vomiting are two side effects of
cancer treatment that patients often fear.




Nausea is that sensation when you feel
like you’re going to throw up. You feel
woozy, queasy, or sick to your stomach.
Nausea often comes before vomiting but
it can also occur without vomiting.

How are nausea and vomiting
prevented?
Your doctors and care team will develop a
treatment plan just for you that will help reduce
or prevent these side effects.

Vomiting is forcefully throwing up what’s
in your stomach. It usually comes out
of your mouth but can also come out
through your nose. Frequent vomiting can
affect your quality of life, your overall wellbeing, and may lead to dehydration.

Prevention is the key. It’s important to try to
prevent these side effects before they develop.
It’s easier to prevent them than treat them—
after nausea and vomiting start, they’re much
harder to stop.

Not every patient gets sick from cancer
therapy. But if you have these side effects, it’s
important to reduce them as much as possible
to prevent them from interfering with your
treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nausea and Vomiting, 2022

This plan will also help you cope if prevention
doesn’t work or comes too late.

What can nausea and vomiting do to you?

What can nausea and vomiting
do to your body?
Nausea and vomiting can be serious and
cause harm to your body, especially if they
happen repeatedly. Nausea and vomiting that
aren’t treated can get worse with time. Nausea
and vomiting can also interrupt or delay your
treatment schedule.

Antiemetics are medications for
preventing or relieving nausea and
vomiting.

The first step is for your doctors and care team
to learn all they can about you. This includes
specifics about you as well as your medical
history of nausea and vomiting.

Nausea and vomiting can cause you to:

Other things your care team will consider when
planning how to prevent nausea and vomiting
are listed in Guide 1.

Not want to eat



Lose fluids (become dehydrated)



Be low in electrolytes, which are minerals
that your body needs to function

When are antiemetics needed?
Stick to the schedule and the instructions you
received with your antiemetic drugs. Make
sure you use these medications at the right
times and at the correct dosage. Don’t skip
a scheduled dose even if you feel fine. If you
wait until you start feeling sick, it may be too
late for the medication to work.

Can I ask for antiemetics?
If your doctor or care team hasn’t already
talked to you about anti-nausea and antiemetic
drugs, you should certainly ask about them.

Nausea can come on within hours after
treatment (acute) or it can take a day or more
(delayed). When nausea is delayed, it can
be more intense and harder to treat. You can
become dehydrated and need fluids, which are
given through an IV (intravenous) tube inserted
into your body.

Many experts believe that anti-nausea and
anti-vomiting medications aren’t used as
often as they should be. This is a problem
that involves both patients and health care
providers. Some patients feel that they don’t
want to bother their care team with questions.
Or they’ve heard that cancer treatment is
supposed to cause nausea and vomiting—
that these side effects are a routine part of
treatment.

When are antiemetics needed?
When patients feel sick, they may cancel
or postpone their cancer treatment. Your
doctors don’t want anything to stop or delay
your treatment. Delaying your treatment may
prolong or cause difficulties with your cancer.

Preventing nausea and
vomiting is the goal.
Once these side effects
start, they can be
difficult to stop.

The goal is to prevent you from feeling sick in
the first place. You want to stay ahead of the
symptoms.
Depending on your cancer treatment, you
may need to use a combination of antiemetic
medications. These medications work best if
taken on a schedule or as soon as you begin
to feel a little queasy.

Can I ask for antiemetics?

At the same time, some care providers may
underestimate how often nausea and vomiting
occur or how disruptive these side effects can
be for patients.

share with us.

If your doctor or care team isn’t aware you’re
feeling sick, they may not ask you about it. But
they do want to help. So if you develop any
side effects from your cancer treatment, don’t
try to “tough it out.” Call your care team and
let them know right away, whether it’s day or
night.

Take our survey and help make the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients
better for everyone!

Also, if you’ve been given anti-nausea or
antiemetic medications but they’re not working
or you don’t like their side effects, let your care
team know about that, too. There are a lot of
options to treat nausea and vomiting.

When to contact
your care team
Nausea and vomiting can be caused
by medical conditions unrelated to your
cancer treatment. It’s important to call
your care team if:

11

•

You continue to have nausea and
vomiting from cancer treatment
despite taking antiemetics.

•

Nausea interferes with your ability to
eat.

•

Vomiting occurs 4 to 5 times in a 24hour period.

•

You feel bloated.

•

You have pain or a swollen stomach
before nausea and vomiting occurs.

•

You’re bothered by the side effects
from your antiemetic medications.

1

Nausea and vomiting basics

Key points

What happens when you vomit?
Vomiting is when the stomach forcefully
empties what’s inside, which comes out of
the mouth as vomit. It’s the body’s way of
protecting itself from harmful substances or
germs.

Step 5

But how exactly does it happen? Here’s a
simplified step-by-step description.



The intestine and stomach, which
contract and begin to shove the stomach
contents upward.



The vomiting center, which opens up
a valve between the stomach and the
esophagus (the tube-shaped organ
between your throat and stomach) so
that the vomit can continue upward.



The diaphragm and the inner walls of the
abdomen, which also contract.



The lungs, which expand.

The vomiting center jumps into action. It
sends out a series of orders to several areas
of the body to perform specific functions. It
transmits signals to:

Step 1

A harmful substance (such as germs, alcohol,
or a chemotherapy drug) enters the body. Or
a sensation (pain, anxiety, or motion) affects
the body.

Step 2

Special receptors in different areas of the
body (stomach, brain, ear, and more) detect
the harmful substance or sensation.

Step 3

These receptors send danger signals to an
area of the brain called the chemoreceptor
trigger zone.

Step 4

The chemoreceptor trigger zone activates
another mechanism in the brain called the
vomiting center. (Some danger signals
bypass the chemoreceptor trigger zone and
go directly to the vomiting center.)

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nausea and Vomiting, 2022

These actions close off the airway (to prevent
vomit from entering it) and propel the vomit
up the throat and out of the mouth.

Breaking the chain of events

Several key interactions happen throughout
this sequence of events. This is when antinausea and anti-vomiting medications get to
work. These medications block the signals
at different points of communication between
the stomach and the brain. This interrupts
or shuts down a part of the sequence.
Researchers still haven’t developed a drug
that will stop the entire vomiting process all
at once (but they’re working on it). That’s
why some people need 2 or more antiemetic
medications to get relief.

Other cancer-related causes of
nausea and vomiting

Many things can cause nausea and
vomiting. This chapter explains which
cancer treatments can cause these
side effects. Nausea and vomiting can
happen before, during, and after cancer
treatment.

Besides cancer therapy, other factors can
cause nausea and vomiting in people with
cancer. These include:


Anxiety

Nausea and vomiting are two of the most
common side effects of cancer treatment.
(Other side effects of cancer treatment include
constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, hair loss, itchy
skin, infections, mouth problems, and other
effects. These aren’t covered in this book.)



Infection



Balance issues



Cancer that spreads to the brain



Lack of minerals in the body (electrolyte
imbalance)

Side effects can happen from the cancer itself,
from health problems caused by cancer, and
from cancer treatment. Sometimes it can be
difficult to tell the difference between the side
effects of cancer treatment and the symptoms
of the cancer itself.



Other drugs’ side effects (for example,
drugs for pain)



Your intestine is blocked or you’re very
constipated



Food staying in your stomach for too long



Abnormal buildup of fluid in the belly area
(abdomen)

Every cancer therapy
has a risk of causing side
effects. These side effects
can happen before, during,
or after treatment.

Cancer treatments that cause
nausea and vomiting
Many cancer treatments can cause nausea
and vomiting:

Sometimes cancer
therapies are combined,
which may increase the
risk of side effects.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nausea and Vomiting, 2022



Chemotherapy uses drugs that disrupt
rapidly dividing cells, including cancer
cells and healthy cells. Chemotherapy is
the most common cause of nausea and
vomiting related to cancer treatment.



Radiation therapy uses high-energy
particles or rays to kill cancer cells.
Radiation causes nausea and vomiting

2

Causes of nausea and vomiting

Treatment-related causes
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting

when it affects rapidly dividing cells in the
intestine.


Targeted therapy seeks out and blocks
how cancer cells grow and move in the
body. Though targeted therapy can cause
nausea and vomiting, it’s more likely to
cause other side effects.



Immunotherapy boosts the body’s
immune system to find and destroy
cancer cells. Immunotherapy can cause
different side effects, some severe but
most mild. One side effect is colitis, an
inflammation of the colon. Symptoms of
colitis include stomach cramps, diarrhea,
bloody stools (poop), and nausea and
vomiting.

Chemotherapy is a systemic (whole-body)
drug therapy that attacks fast-dividing cancer
cells. It can also damage normal cells in the
process. Damage to normal cells causes side
effects. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy
also cause side effects.
There are several different types of
chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting. These types include acute,
delayed, anticipatory, breakthrough, and
refractory. Read about the different types of
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in
Guide 2.

The side effects you’re likely to have depend
on the type of cancer treatment you get. For
example, chemotherapy can cause more side
effects than other cancer therapies, such as
targeted therapy and immunotherapy.
The amount (dose) of chemotherapy or
radiation therapy can also have an effect
on your body. Higher doses often cause
more severe side effects. Your body can
react to these therapies as if they’re harmful
or poisonous. Indeed, chemotherapy and
radiation therapy are like poisons that attack
and kill the cancer cells inside your body.

A note about nausea
Although it seems like nausea and
vomiting are two phases of the same
illness, they may be separate conditions.
Nausea often occurs without vomiting
during cancer treatment or pregnancy,
for example. Antiemetics can prevent or
greatly reduce vomiting, but they may be
less effective against nausea.

The nausea and vomiting related to
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and
immunotherapy are grouped together and
called chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting. The nausea and vomiting related to
radiation is called radiation-induced nausea
and vomiting. (The term “induced” means “to
bring on something.”)

Causes of nausea and vomiting

Treatment-related causes

Guide 2
Types of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
Acute nausea and vomiting occur soon after cancer therapy (within minutes to hours).
• Acute nausea and vomiting usually stop within the first 24 hours of cancer therapy.
• The intensity hits its peak after 5 to 6 hours and then begins to lessen.
• Acute is linked to the type and amount of cancer treatment given, the environment where it’s
given, patient-specific factors (risk factors), and the patient’s history of nausea and vomiting.
Delayed nausea and vomiting occur more than 24 hours after treatment is given.
• Delayed nausea is often more common, more severe, and more resistant to treatment than acute
nausea.
• Delayed nausea and vomiting commonly occur with chemotherapy drugs that have a high risk of
causing vomiting, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, or doxorubicin.
• With cisplatin, vomiting can last for 6 to 7 days. Vomiting is at its worst about 2 to 3 days after
cisplatin is given.
Anticipatory nausea and vomiting occur in anticipation of the next treatment to be given.
• Anticipatory nausea and vomiting come from an emotional or physical reaction to a past bad
experience when getting treatment. (Anticipatory means expecting something to happen.) The
patient anxiously expects the bad experience to happen again.
• Anticipatory nausea and vomiting can be triggered by smells, sights, or sounds related to
treatment.
• Younger people with cancer are more likely to have this type.
• Younger people also may be more likely to develop this type because they have less control over
vomiting.
• Nausea is more common than vomiting with this type. Anti-anxiety medication seems to help.
Breakthrough nausea and vomiting happen despite prevention with antiemetic drugs.
• Additional or different antiemetic drugs are used for breakthrough nausea and vomiting.

Refractory nausea and vomiting keep happening after each treatment cycle.
• Antiemetics haven’t been able to control nausea or vomiting in previous treatment cycles. So
nausea and vomiting keep coming back with each following cycle.
• Medication to prevent nausea or vomiting just isn’t working.

Causes of nausea and vomiting

Risk of nausea and vomiting
Guide 3
Cancer drugs with moderate to
high risk of nausea and vomiting

Radiation-induced nausea and
vomiting

Radiation therapy is a systemic therapy that
often uses a large machine to transmit highenergy rays (radiation) to kill cancer cells.
The risk of nausea and vomiting gets higher
as the doses of radiation get larger and more
frequent, and reach more areas of the body.

Oral drugs (pills, tablets, capsules)

Radiation therapy aims to kill rapidly dividing
cancer cells. The radiation may also damage
healthy tissue, causing side effects. Radiation
that treats the upper abdomen or whole body
may reach the stomach and intestine (the long
section of the digestive system that absorbs
nutrients from food). Because the digestive
system has many rapidly dividing cells, it’s
sensitive to radiation treatment. So when the
stomach and the intestine receive radiation,
nausea and vomiting are more likely to
happen.

Risk of nausea and vomiting
Every cancer therapy has a risk of causing
side effects. These side effects can happen
before, during, or after treatment. Your doctor
or care provider will select an antiemetic
treatment based on your cancer therapy’s
risk of causing nausea and vomiting. The risk
of these side effects depends on the specific
treatment type and the part of your body that’s
being treated.
Sometimes cancer therapies are combined,
which may increase the risk of side effects. If
you’re getting more than one cancer therapy,
your health care providers will base your
antiemesis plan on the cancer therapy with
the highest risk of side effects. Your care team

To assess the level of risk, your care team
will also consider the form of cancer therapy.
These therapies include drugs injected into
your body (IVs and injections) and those you
swallow (pills, tablets, and capsules).

Risks from chemotherapy drugs

Chemotherapy drugs are grouped into 4 levels
based on their risk of causing nausea and
vomiting: high, moderate, low, and minimal.
The higher the drug’s risk level, the more likely
it is to cause nausea and vomiting.

Cancer drugs with moderate to high risk

Risks from radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is more likely to cause
nausea and vomiting when it’s given in larger
or more frequent doses, and when more areas
of the body are treated.
Like chemotherapy, radiation therapy also
has 4 risk levels. The level of risk is based on
the areas of the body being given radiation.
The highest risk for nausea and vomiting is
radiation to the whole body. The lowest risk is
radiation to the arms and legs. See Guide 5.
When chemotherapy and radiation are given
together (chemoradiation therapy), the type,
dose, and schedule of antiemetic drugs are
based on the chemotherapy’s risk of side
effects.

Avoid becoming

But antiemetics can also be given after starting
cancer therapy if the therapy is likely to cause
delayed nausea and vomiting. After the last
dose of chemotherapy, the possibility that
you’ll start vomiting lasts for at least 3 days
with high-risk chemotherapy drugs and 2 days
with moderate-risk chemotherapy drugs. You
should continue to take antiemetic medication
for as long as the risk exists.

In addition to drugs, other types of therapy like
meditation or breathing exercises may help
you feel better. When and how much you eat
can also affect nausea and vomiting. We’ll
discuss these non-drug methods in Chapter 4.

Preventing nausea and vomiting is the goal.
So anti-nausea and anti-vomiting drugs are
given before cancer treatment.

Anti-nausea and anti-vomiting drugs are listed
in Guide 6.

What anti-nausea or antiemetic drug (or
drugs) to give you

Timing of drugs

Medication is the main treatment for nausea
and vomiting. Most medications are taken
before cancer treatment, although some can
be taken afterward. It’s usually much easier to
prevent nausea and vomiting than it is to treat
them once they’ve started. That’s why this
book emphasizes prevention.

drug for preventing radiation-induced nausea
and vomiting. If you’ll be receiving radiation
therapy, your doctor may recommend a 5-HT3
antagonist with or without other medication.

Antiemetic drugs come in different forms.
These include the kind you swallow such as
tablets, capsules, oral liquid, and those that
dissolve in your mouth. Other antiemetics
are injected into your body—into a vein, a
muscle, or under your skin. Other forms are
transdermal patches (placed on your skin) and
rectal suppositories (inserted into the rectum).

The different classes of anti-nausea and
antiemetic drugs include:
Serotonin (5-HT3) antagonists
Serotonin (also called 5-HT3) is a
neurotransmitter that’s triggered by cancer
therapy to carry the vomiting impulse from the
intestine to the brain. The 5-HT3 antagonists
are a type of drug that blocks serotonin from
reaching the brain, which can prevent nausea
and vomiting. The 5-HT3 antagonists also
sometimes decrease diarrhea, a troublesome
result of radiation therapy.

Types of drugs

There are different types (classes) of
antiemetics and even different ways they’re
given. Your doctor will recommend what’s
known to work for preventing or treating
your type of nausea and vomiting. For
example, scientists have found that 5-HT3
antagonists are the most effective type of

Drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting

The most common side effects of 5-HT3
antagonists are headache and constipation.
Because 5-HT3 antagonists are less effective
against delayed nausea and vomiting as they
are against the acute type, they’re often paired
with neurokinin-1 (NK-1) antagonists and other
medications.

prescribed olanzapine in combination with
prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids (steroids) have been used
for years to prevent both acute and delayed
nausea and vomiting caused by cancer
therapy. The main steroid used for nausea
and vomiting is dexamethasone. If your
chemotherapy already includes a steroid,
you may not need dexamethasone as an
antiemetic.

Neurokinin-1 (NK-1) antagonists
NK-1 antagonists prevent both acute and
delayed nausea and vomiting by blocking
a neurotransmitter called Substance P.
Substance P has dozens of functions as a
neurotransmitter—one of which is setting off
the vomiting reflex. NK-1 antagonists are drugs
that prevent Substance P from attaching to the
NK-1 receptors in the brain, which may stop
or reduce the vomiting reflex. Common side
effects of NK-1 antagonists include tiredness
(fatigue), hiccups, and headache.

Steroids can have a lot of side effects, such
as insomnia, upset stomach, and raised
blood sugar levels. So the dose, frequency,
and duration of using this medication are
customized for each patient. Other techniques
can also decrease steroids’ side effects.
For example, taking dexamethasone in the
morning can help reduce insomnia. Also,
taking dexamethasone with food can prevent
an upset stomach.

Atypical antipsychotic
Olanzapine is a drug that has been used
historically for treating mental health
conditions. But doctors have discovered it
also prevents and treats acute, delayed,
and refractory nausea and vomiting in
patients receiving moderate- to high-risk
chemotherapy. Olanzapine disables several
neurotransmitters linked to nausea and
vomiting caused by cancer therapy. It’s
typically given in combination with 2 or 3 other
antiemetic drugs prior to chemotherapy, but
may be given by itself or with other antiemetics
after chemotherapy. Olanzapine sometimes
causes drowsiness (sedation), fatigue, and
dizziness. It should be used with caution in
older patients and patients with dementia.
Because this medication can cause sedation,
it may be more effective if taken at bedtime.
Check with your care team if you were

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nausea and Vomiting, 2022

Dopamine antagonists
Dopamine receptor antagonists were the first
class of drugs used for nausea and vomiting
due to cancer treatment. These drugs block
the neurotransmitter dopamine from reaching
the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain.
Dopamine antagonists can cause numerous
side effects, such as sedation, dry mouth,
constipation, uncontrollable muscle
movements or tremors, and blurred vision.
Older patients may be more affected by these
side effects.

Drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting

Cannabinoids
Cannabinoids are drugs that contain the
active ingredient in cannabis (marijuana).
Cannabinoids prevent nausea and vomiting
by blocking receptors in the central nervous
system’s endocannabinoid system. The
endocannabinoid system regulates many
functions, some of which involve hunger and
mood.

Cannabinoids can even stimulate appetite
in people having cancer treatment. But they
also have some undesirable side effects such
as dizziness, sleepiness, lightheadedness,
anxiety, mood changes, and other effects.
Before using cannabinoids, ask your doctor
about any possible side effects you might
have.
Motion sickness medication
Motion sickness medication can be added to
regular antiemetics if you have breakthrough
nausea and vomiting. Because capsules or

Cannabinoids are sometimes used to
treat nausea and vomiting when standard
antiemetic drugs haven’t worked.

Can I try cannabis?

Take your medication on
time

You may hear that smoking
marijuana or taking capsules,
edibles, or drops made
from the active compounds in cannabis
(cannabinoids) will drastically reduce nausea
or vomiting. You may hear that they’ll dull
your pain or help you sleep.

It’s important to take anti-nausea
and antiemetic drugs at the
scheduled time and dose, even if you don’t
feel nauseated. If you wait until you begin to
feel sick, it may be too late for the drugs to
provide relief.

But before you take a trip to your nearest
dispensary, discuss this with your doctor.
And don’t stop or skip your prescribed
medications in place of non-prescribed
cannabis products. The ingredients in these
products can interfere with your current
cancer therapy or your antiemetic treatment.
Also, the active ingredients and effects can
vary greatly between products.

Why did my doctor give me
an antipsychotic drug?

For many years now, olanzapine
(Zyprexa) has been widely
used to prevent nausea and vomiting in
people receiving cancer treatment. But
olanzapine has been used even longer
to treat depression, bipolar disorder, and
schizophrenia. Scientists have found
that olanzapine blocks some of the same
neurotransmitters involved in both vomiting
and mental health conditions.

(Marinol) is available and approved by the

Combinations of antiemetics

Combinations of antiemetics

pills may be difficult to keep down during
breakthrough emesis, this medication comes
as a patch applied to the skin behind your ear.
The patch releases the medication through the
skin and into the body. One patch works for
about 3 days. Side effects include dizziness
and disorientation (confusion).

People who have cancer therapy that lasts
for several days will need an antiemesis plan
that prevents both acute and delayed nausea
and vomiting. Antiemesis treatment generally
includes more medications for the acute
period (first day of cancer therapy) than for
the delayed period (next 2 or 3 days of cancer
therapy). But because acute and delayed
emesis can overlap during cancer therapy, it
can be difficult to come up with an antiemesis
plan that’s completely effective for every day.

Heartburn medication
Along with nausea and vomiting, cancer
treatment can cause indigestion and
heartburn. Drugs called histamine H2
antagonists (H2 blockers) and proton pump
inhibitors reduce the stomach acid that causes
heartburn. Brand name H2 blockers include
Pepcid and Zantac. Common proton pump
inhibitors are Prevacid, Prilosec, and Nexium.

Your antiemesis plan also depends on
the risk of nausea and vomiting from your
cancer therapy. Cancer therapy with a high
risk of nausea and vomiting may require a
combination of up to 3 or 4 antiemetic drugs.
Cancer treatment with a moderate risk may
include 2 or 3 antiemetics. Low-risk cancer
therapy may involve only 1 antiemetic. Cancer
therapy with a minimal risk may not require
any anti-nausea or anti-vomiting drugs.

Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines are anti-anxiety drugs. They
reduce anticipatory nausea and vomiting
by helping patients who feel anxious to feel
calmer and more relaxed. Benzodiazepines
are also sometimes used to reduce anxiety
due to breakthrough nausea and vomiting.
The main benzodiazepine drug for nausea and
vomiting is lorazepam.

Remember that therapy that works for one
patient may not work for another. So be sure
to let your care team know if your anti-nausea
and anti-vomiting drugs aren’t helping. If the
first drug or combination of drugs didn’t work,
your doctor can switch one drug for another or
add a medication from a different class.

Benzodiazepines are used in combination with
other antiemetic drugs. Their most common
side effects are drowsiness, dizziness, and
confusion. Benzodiazepines can also cause
dangerously slow breathing in patients who are
taking opioid-based pain medication. If you’re
taking lorazepam regularly, talk to your care
team before you stop taking this medication to
avoid unwanted side effects

Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting

Radiation-induced nausea and
vomiting
Some types of radiation therapy—to the upper
abdomen or the whole body—may cause side
effects of nausea and vomiting. Antiemetic
treatment is given on each day of radiation
therapy to prevent these side effects. The
recommended treatment is a 5-HT3 antagonist
(granisetron or ondansetron) with or without a
steroid (dexamethasone).

Managing nausea and vomiting

Treatment if prevention doesn’t work

Even with prevention, nausea and
vomiting sometimes happen anyway.
This chapter explains various drug
options and many non-drug strategies
to manage and cope with these side
effects.

Go on an around-the-clock schedule
Instead of taking your anti-nausea or
antiemetic drug(s) on an as-needed basis,
you may be put on a schedule to take your
medication around the clock.

Try a different route

If you can’t keep down a pill because you’re
vomiting, you might be able to receive the
medication in another form. For example,
some pills also come as a tablet or a film that
quickly dissolves under your tongue. Other
methods include IV, injection, skin patch, or
suppository (a medication placed in the anus).
If one method gives you trouble, ask if you can
try a different one.

Treatment if prevention doesn’t
work
Despite using antiemetic drugs before cancer
therapy, some people still have nausea
and vomiting during or after therapy (called
breakthrough emesis). The treatment plan
changes from preventing nausea and vomiting
to reducing these side effects.

See if it’s something else

Before you receive your next round of cancer
therapy, your doctor should check that there
isn’t another reason why you’re having nausea
and vomiting. Be open with your doctor about
any side effects you have. There might be
another cause that’s related or even unrelated
to your cancer. Other causes could be a lack
of minerals in your body, stomach problems, or
another disease.

Your doctor or care team may ask you to try
one or more of these treatment options for
breakthrough nausea and vomiting:

Add another medication

The first option is to add another drug from a
different drug class. The idea is to choose a
drug that works differently than the anti-nausea
or antiemetic drug(s) you’re already taking.

Even something like heartburn can be
confused with nausea. In this case, your
doctor can give you antacid therapy to reduce
stomach acid. Your care team may also help
you find other ways to cope.

Take several medications

You may need to take several antiemetic
medications, each of which works in a
separate way. This strategy attempts to block
the emetic reaction at different points in the
process. Your doctor or pharmacist may also
recommend taking your medication on a
different schedule or at different times of day.
(Don’t do this on your own without first asking
your doctor or pharmacist.)

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nausea and Vomiting, 2022

Keep track of your side effects

Your doctor may ask you to be aware of
how you’re feeling between visits. Pay close
attention to when you’re nauseated or when
you vomit. You can write down that information
and share it with your doctor. Your care

30

4

Managing nausea and vomiting

Coping with nausea and vomiting

team needs to know exactly what you’re
experiencing to be able to help.

It’s also a good idea to let your caregiver
know if you’re having any side effects. Your
caregiver can help you track when side effects
are happening, and knows what works best to
make you feel better.

Think about ways to keep track of your side
effects. You can write them down in a weekly
diary or create your own way to record any
side effects you experience. Tracking your side
effects in a journal or app may reveal a helpful
pattern.

Another thing you can do in between visits is
to make a list of questions you have. Review
these questions with your doctor. Some people
don’t want to ask questions—perhaps they
think their questions are unimportant or they’re
afraid of wasting the doctor’s time. You need to
know that your care team wants to help you by
answering any questions you have.

You also need to remember to take your antinausea and antiemetic drugs as prescribed.
Use a calendar or an app to remind you when
to take your medication. This will help you stay
on schedule and, if needed, record any missed
doses. Caregivers can also use these to help
you take your medication on time.

Other people on your team can also answer
your questions. Feel free to talk to your
primary care doctor, nurse practitioner,
medical oncologist, radiation oncologist,
oncology nurse, pharmacist, physical therapist,
psychologist, or social worker.

You can try one of these smartphone apps
to help you keep track of medications,
appointments, and symptoms:


Cancer.Net Mobile – A mobile app from
the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) that allows users to track side
effects. You can set reminders for
medications and appointments, too.



chemoWave – An app designed for
people getting cancer treatment. It keeps
track of your symptoms, medications,
mood, activity, and sleep.

Chapter 5.

Coping with nausea and
vomiting
In addition to treatment, several other
strategies can help you cope with nausea and
vomiting.

Symple Symptom Tracker – A userfriendly app that allows you to track all
kinds of symptoms, not just those from
cancer treatment.

Eat small meals

Instead of three large meals (breakfast, lunch,
and dinner), try several small, frequent meals
throughout the day. Eating less but more often
can be easier and less filling than eating fewer
larger meals.

Report problems and ask questions

Your providers need to know if your antiemetic
drugs aren’t working. If the side effects
continue or get worse with time, call your
doctor or care team as soon as possible.

Complementary therapies

Drink plenty of fluids

Sniff good smells

Nausea can turn you off from eating and
drinking, while vomiting can cause you to lose
a lot of fluids. To avoid getting dehydrated,
drink small amounts of fluids frequently
throughout the day. In addition to water,
electrolyte supplements (Pedialyte) and lowsugar sports drinks (Gatorade) can replace
important minerals. Ginger ale or flat cola
might help settle your stomach. Don’t drink as
much while you’re eating, though—it’ll make
you feel fuller faster.

Though many smells can trigger nausea,
some smells have been known to help. For
short-term relief, try taking long deep sniffs
of a newly opened alcohol wipe. The smell of
peppermint or sucking on peppermint candy
may also “ease the quease.”

Get some fresh air

A breath of fresh air can help. Breathe in
deeply and exhale slowly.

Talk to a dietician

Eat to avoid more nausea

Ask your doctor or care team to put you in
touch with a registered dietitian or a certified
nutritionist. They can recommend ways to
get enough nutrition even if you don’t feel like
eating.

It’s normal to want to skip eating when you
feel nausea coming on. Surprisingly, an empty
stomach can make nausea worse. If it’s been
a while since you’ve eaten, have a little food
even if you’re not hungry. As noted above, eat
small portions frequently throughout the day.

Eat cool food

Complementary therapies

Hot food has a stronger smell and taste. If the
smell or taste bothers you, eat food cold or at
room temperature.

Complementary therapies offer other ways
to prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting.
Complementary therapies are meant to be
used alongside standard therapies. They
shouldn’t be used instead of your prescribed
therapy. Talk to your doctor before using any
type of complementary therapy.

Avoid offensive smells

Common smells that never bothered you
before may become unexpectedly unpleasant.
Strong smells—or even mild ones—can make
you feel nauseated. Smells you might want to
avoid include:


food while it’s cooking



What to do after you vomit
Suck on hard candy. Or lick
a popsicle or a lollipop. These
help produce saliva, which aids
digestion and soothes your
stomach.

This book is mostly about preventing nausea
and vomiting. But what if you just threw up?
Now what do you do?
Sit and rest for 15 to 20
minutes. Let your stomach settle
down before doing anything else.

Chew gum. The action of
chewing is believed to get your
stomach and intestines back on
track.

Rinse your mouth. If you have a
bad or acidic taste in your mouth,
mix 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda
into 1 cup of warm water. Baking
soda neutralizes stomach acid.
Swish it around your mouth and
spit it out. Rinse with plain water.

Try bland foods. If you feel like
eating, and you can keep down
water for several hours without
throwing up, start with small bites
of light, bland food. Try crackers,
rice, toast, applesauce, or
bananas. Go slowly. Avoid heavy,
large meals and spicy, fatty, oily,
or acidic foods.

Drink slowly. If you’ve given
your stomach time to settle and
you haven’t thrown up again,
drink sips of water or suck on a
few ice chips every few minutes.
Gatorade, Pedialyte, and other
clear fluids are good, too. After a
while, you can try broth or Jell-O.

Sit up. Keep sitting upright for an
hour or longer after eating. Lying
down can cause indigestion.

If you throw up again after eating or drinking, start over by letting your stomach settle.

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your care
team.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your care
team. If you get to know your care team and
let them get to know you, you’ll feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your team.
Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.
Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


We want your
feedback!

What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you
