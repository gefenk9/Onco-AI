About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal
Cancer, Version 3.2024 — July 15, 2024.

The ovaries

Most ovarian cancers are found
in the surface layer of tissue

The ovaries are part of the female reproductive
system. In addition to the 2 ovaries, this
system includes the fallopian tubes, uterus,
cervix, and vagina. The ovaries make eggs
needed for sexual reproduction. They also
release hormones that affect breast growth,
body shape, and the menstrual cycle (periods).

surrounding the ovaries, called
the epithelium. These cancers can
also start in the fallopian tube,
close to where the tube meets
the ovary. This guide provides

Each ovary is about the size and shape of a
grape. One is on the left side of the uterus and
the other is on the right. Each is surrounded by
a long, thin tube called a fallopian tube.

treatment recommendations for
common and rare ovarian cancers.

After an egg is pushed out by the ovary, it is
caught by the fallopian tube and travels into
the uterus. Here the fetus grows and develops
during pregnancy. If the egg is not fertilized,
this leads to a period. The uterus and at least
1 ovary and fallopian tube are needed for
menstruation and pregnancy.

The female reproductive

The female reproductive system
includes the ovaries, fallopian
tubes, uterus, cervix, and

1 Ovarian cancer basics » Types of ovarian cancer

Types of ovarian cancer

Primary peritoneal
cancer

Most ovarian cancers are found in the outer
surface of the ovaries, called the epithelium.
There are more than 5 types of epithelial
ovarian cancer. The most common forms are:


High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)



High-grade endometrioid carcinoma

Primary peritoneal cancer forms
in the the tissue that lines the
abdominal wall and covers the
abdominal organs. The treatment
information in this guide also applies
to primary peritoneal cancer and
fallopian tube cancer.

Less common ovarian cancers
Rare types of ovarian cancer are called less
common ovarian cancers (LCOCs) or less
common ovarian histologies (LCOHs). They
can start in the epithelium, in tissues that
support the ovaries, or in the reproductive
(egg) cells of the ovary.

How is the type determined?
To diagnose ovarian cancer and determine the
cancer type, tumor tissue needs to be removed
from your body and tested.

Less common epithelial ovarian cancers
include:


Low-grade serous carcinoma



Low-grade endometrioid carcinoma



Carcinosarcoma (also called malignant
mixed Mullerian tumors)



Clear cell carcinoma



Mucinous carcinoma



If surgery is planned first, the tumor and other
tissues removed during surgery will be tested.
If chemotherapy is planned first, a biopsy
will be performed to remove a sample of the
tumor. A physician expert called a pathologist
determines the type of ovarian cancer by
examining the cancerous tissue.
The pathologist also determines the cancer
grade. The grade is a rating of how abnormal
the cancer cells look under a microscope.
High-grade cancers grow and spread more
quickly than low-grade cancers. The cancer
grade is different than the stage.

Borderline epithelial tumor (also called
low malignant potential tumors)

Less common non-epithelial ovarian
cancers include:


Malignant sex-cord stromal tumors



Malignant germ cell tumors

Stages are categories that describe where the
cancer has or hasn't spread from the ovary.
Surgery is needed in order to know exactly
how much cancer is in the body. Testing can
provide a best guess of how far the cancer has
spread before surgery.

change of plan.

Your treatment team

Key points

Treatment for ovarian cancer takes a team
of experts. When possible, a gynecologic
oncologist should perform the initial surgery.
This type of doctor is an expert in surgery and
chemotherapy for gynecologic cancers.



Your care team may also include a medical
oncologist. This doctor is an expert in
treating cancer with chemotherapy and other
medicines.





You may also receive care from registered
nurses, nurse practitioners, physician
assistants, social workers, genetic counselors,
sexual health experts, and others. Ask for the
names and contact information of your care
providers to be included in the treatment plan.



Cancer treatment may be improved if your
primary care provider is involved. They can
help manage other health conditions that may
be affected by your cancer treatment.



Your treatment plan
There isn't one treatment plan that is best for
everyone. There is often more than one option,
including clinical trials. Clinical trials study
the safety and effectiveness of investigational
treatments. The treatment that you and your
care team agree on should be noted in the
treatment plan, along with possible side
effects.
Keep in mind that your plan may change.
Testing may provide new information. Your
feelings about treatment may change. Side

The ovaries are a pair of grapesized organs in the pelvis. They
make hormones and eggs for sexual
reproduction.
Most ovarian cancers affect the layer of
tissue surrounding the ovaries, called the
epithelium.
High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)
and high-grade endometrioid carcinoma
are the most common types of ovarian
tumors.
Less common ovarian cancers can start
in the epithelium, in tissues that support
the ovaries, or in the reproductive (egg)
cells of the ovary.
Treating ovarian cancer takes a team of
experts. Gynecologic oncologists and
medical oncologists often work together to
plan your treatment.

suspected ovarian cancer,

Testing also helps determine whether surgery
first is the best treatment. Having surgery
first may not be possible based on the size
and location of the tumor, or because of other
health factors.

including whether surgery is
possible.

Ovarian cancer can cause changes in the
body that you can feel or notice. But you might
not have symptoms until the tumor has grown
large or the cancer has spread. Common
symptoms include:


Feeling bloated



Heartburn and indigestion



Pain or pressure in the pelvis or belly



Trouble eating or feeling full fast



Having to urinate often or urgently



Pain during sex

Abdominal and pelvic exam
Your provider will feel different areas of your
belly. This is called an abdominal exam. They
are checking to see if organs are of normal
size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched. Your doctor will also feel for signs
of fluid buildup (ascites) in the belly area or
around the ovaries.
Your provider will also feel for abnormal
changes in the size, shape, or position of your
ovaries, cervix, and uterus. This is called a
pelvic exam. A widening instrument, called a
speculum, is used to view your vagina and
cervix. A sample of cells may be removed for
testing. This is known as a Pap test. It is used
to detect cervical cancer or pre-cancer, not
ovarian cancer.

These symptoms can also be caused by
hormonal changes or other common health
problems. Ovarian cancer is more likely to be
the cause if the symptoms:


Began less than 1 year ago,



Occur more than 12 days per month, and



Are becoming more severe over time.

Sometimes, a biopsy of the uterine lining (an
endometrial biopsy) may be part of the initial
evaluation during the pelvic exam. This test
can rule out a uterine cancer.

If your provider suspects ovarian cancer
based on your symptoms, you will have testing
as described in this chapter. Testing helps
determine the clinical (pre-treatment) stage.
The clinical stage provides a best guess of
how far the cancer has spread. It is a best

An exam of the rectum and vagina together
may also be done to check for cancer in the
space between the rectum and vagina. This is
called a rectovaginal exam.

2 Testing for ovarian cancer » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

The 2 types of ultrasounds that may be used
to look for ovarian cancer are described next.
Both are done using a hand-held device called
an ultrasound probe. Ultrasounds are generally
painless, but you may feel some discomfort
when the probe is inserted.

Imaging tests can show the location, size,
and shape of an ovarian tumor. They can also
show if the cancer has spread beyond the
ovaries. Your care team will tell you how to
prepare for your imaging tests.

For a transabdominal ultrasound, a gel will be
spread on your abdomen and pelvis. The gel
helps to make the pictures clearer. Your doctor
will place the probe on your skin and guide it
back and forth in the gel.

Ultrasound
Ultrasound is often the first imaging test used
to look for ovarian cancer. It uses sound waves
to make pictures of areas inside of the body.
Ultrasound is good at showing the size, shape,
and location of the ovaries, fallopian tubes,
uterus, and nearby tissues. It can also show if
there is a mass in the ovary and whether the
mass is solid or filled with fluid.

For a transvaginal ultrasound, your doctor will
insert the probe into your vagina. This may
help the doctor see your ovaries more clearly.

Transvaginal ultrasound
Ultrasound uses sound
waves to make pictures of
the inside of the body. For
a transvaginal ultrasound,
a probe is inserted into the
vagina. Ultrasounds are
generally painless, but you
may feel some discomfort
when the probe is inserted.

2 Testing for ovarian cancer » Imaging tests

CT

MRI

Imaging to look for ovarian cancer may include
computed tomography (CT) scans of your
abdomen, pelvis, and chest. CT scans are
good at showing if the cancer has spread
outside of the ovaries. They may also show if
nearby lymph nodes are bigger than normal.
This can be a sign that the cancer has spread.

If the ultrasound images are unclear, you may
have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
your abdomen and pelvis. An MRI of your
chest or liver may be used to look for signs
of cancer spread. MRI doesn’t use radiation.
It uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of areas inside the body.

If you can have it, a substance called contrast
is used to make the pictures clearer. Before
the scan you will be asked to drink a large
glass of oral contrast. A contrast agent will
also be injected into your vein. It may cause
you to feel flushed or get hives. Rarely, allergic
reactions can occur. Tell your team if you've
had an allergic reaction to contrast in the past.

Getting an MRI scan is similar to getting a
CT scan but takes longer. Like a CT scan,
a contrast agent may be used to make the
pictures clearer. You will lie on a table that
moves through a large tunnel in the scanning
machine.
The machine is more enclosed than a CT
scan. Tell your care team if you get nervous in
enclosed spaces. You may be given a type of
medicine called a sedative to help you relax.

A CT scanner is a large machine with a
tunnel in the middle. While you lie on a table
that moves through the tunnel, the scanner
will rotate an x-ray beam around you to take
pictures from many angles.

CT scan
A CT scan is a more
detailed kind of x-ray. It
takes a lot of pictures,
or images, from different
angles. A computer then
combines the images to
make 3-D pictures.

2 Testing for ovarian cancer » Biopsy

Biopsy

PET
CT or MRI are sometimes combined with
positron emission tomography (PET). A
PET scan shows how your cells are using a
simple form of sugar, which can be helpful for
identifying cancer. A sugar radiotracer is put
into your body through a vein. The radiotracer
puts out a small amount of energy that is
detected by the machine that takes pictures.
Cancer cells appear brighter because they use
sugar faster than normal cells.

To diagnose ovarian cancer, a sample of tissue
must be removed from your body for testing.
This is called a biopsy. The biopsy is usually
done during initial surgery to remove the
cancer.
But sometimes a biopsy is done to diagnose
ovarian cancer before surgery or other planned
treatment. This may be the case if the cancer
has spread too much to be removed by
surgery initially and chemotherapy is needed
first. In such cases, a fine-needle aspiration
(FNA) biopsy, core biopsy, or paracentesis
may be used.

PET is very good at showing small groups of
cancer cells. This test may also be useful for
showing if ovarian cancer has spread.

Chest x-ray

FNA uses a very thin needle to remove a
small sample of tissue from the tumor. A core
biopsy removes tissue samples with a hollow
needle. For paracentesis, a long, thin needle is
inserted through the skin of the belly to remove
a sample of fluid.

A chest x-ray can show if cancer has spread
to your lungs. It may be ordered with other
tests when ovarian cancer is first suspected or
found. It may also be used to check treatment
results. A chest x-ray is fast and painless and
uses small amounts of radiation.

The biopsy samples are sent to a pathologist
for testing. A pathologist is a doctor who is
an expert in testing cells to find disease.
The pathologist views the samples with a
microscope to look for cancer cells. If the cells
are cancerous, the pathologist notes their
appearance and other features.

Diagnostic laparoscopy
If the cancer is advanced, you may have a
diagnostic laparoscopy before treatment.
The goal is to learn how much cancer is in
the abdomen. It helps your doctors to decide
whether surgery can be the first treatment, or if
chemotherapy is needed first.

Prior surgery or biopsy
The cancer may have been found during a
surgery or biopsy performed by another doctor.
In this case, your treatment team will need to
review the prior surgery and testing results. A
pathologist will examine the tumor tissue with
a microscope to make sure it is ovarian cancer.
Your doctors will also want to know if any
cancer was left in your body after surgery.

This minimally invasive procedure involves
making a tiny cut in the abdomen. A thin tube
with a light and a camera (laparoscope) is
used to view the lining of the abdomen and
the surface of organs in the abdomen. Tissue
samples are taken and tested for cancer cells
in a lab.

2 Testing for ovarian cancer » Family history and genetic testing

Family history and genetic
testing

normal tissue–either blood, saliva, or a cheek
swab. Those with a positive genetic test or
who have a strong cancer family history should
see a health expert. This is typically a genetic
counselor. A genetic counselor has special
training to help patients understand changes in
genes that are related to disease.

Ovarian cancer usually occurs for unknown
reasons. However, about 1 in 6 ovarian
cancers is caused by mutations (changes) in
genes that are passed down from parent to
child. This is called hereditary ovarian cancer.
It is most often caused by mutations in either
breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or breast
cancer gene 2 (BRCA2).

There are many other hereditary syndromes
besides BRCA and Lynch. Genetic testing
typically tests for all of them. Commercial
genetic tests currently available over the
counter look for the most common gene
mutations, but aren't comprehensive.

Everyone has BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.
When working properly, they are helpful and
repair damaged cells. But mutations in these
genes increase the risk of developing ovarian,
breast, and some other cancers.

In addition to testing for germline (inherited)
BRCA mutations, the tumor itself should be
tested for mutations in the BRCA and related
genes. These are known as somatic or tumor
mutations.

Another cause of hereditary ovarian cancer is
Lynch syndrome. Lynch syndrome is the most
common cause of hereditary colon and uterine
cancers but can also cause ovarian and other
cancers. Ovarian cancer associated with a
BRCA mutation or Lynch syndrome usually
starts at a younger age than non-hereditary
ovarian cancer. Using your age, health history,
and family history, your doctor will assess
how likely you are to have hereditary ovarian
cancer.

Genetic testing is recommended for
everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It
can determine if you have a mutation in the
BRCA genes, or in other genes that play a
role in hereditary cancer.

Genetic testing can tell if you have a mutation
in the BRCA genes, or in other genes that play
a role in hereditary cancer. It is recommended
for everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
If initial treatment works well, BRCA status
(whether you have a BRCA mutation) plays
an important role in guiding decisions about
maintenance therapy.
Genetic testing may be done through your
gynecology or oncology care team, or by a
genetic counselor. The testing is done on

2 Testing for ovarian cancer » Nutritional and digestive tract health » Blood tests

Nutritional and digestive
tract health

Blood tests
The following tests are not used alone to
diagnose ovarian cancer, but abnormal results
may signal health problems.

Your provider may ask about your diet and
eating habits. Symptoms of ovarian cancer
include bloating, pain in the pelvis or abdomen,
difficulty eating, and feeling full quickly.

General health
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
number of red blood cells, white blood cells,
and platelets in a sample of blood. Red blood
cells carry oxygen throughout the body. White
blood cells fight infection. Platelets help to
control bleeding. Your blood counts may be
too low or too high because of cancer or other
health problems.

These symptoms may cause you to eat less
in general, or to eat foods lacking in nutrients.
Your overall health and nutrition level can have
an impact on the success of surgery and other
treatment outcomes. If you need help planning
healthy meals or have questions about your
diet, ask your provider for a referral to a
registered dietitian or nutritionist.

A blood chemistry profile measures the levels
of different chemicals that are affected by your
kidneys, bones, and other organs and tissues.
Levels that are too high or too low may be a
sign that an organ isn’t working well. Abnormal
levels may also be caused by the spread of
cancer or by other diseases. This test can
also provide information about nutrient intake,
such as protein levels. This can help guide
treatment decisions.

Your doctor may want to check your
gastrointestinal (GI) tract using an imaging
test. The GI tract is made of the organs that
food passes through when you eat. This
includes your stomach, small bowel, and large
bowel (rectum and colon).
An imaging tool called a scope is used to
examine these organs. A scope is a long, thin
tube with a light and a camera that can be
guided into your body. A colonoscopy is used
to examine the large bowel. This involves
inserting a scope into your anus and guiding
it through the rectum and colon. To examine
the upper GI tract, a scope is guided down the
throat into the esophagus, stomach, and small
bowel. This is called an upper endoscopy.

The liver is an organ that does many important
jobs, such as removing toxins from your blood.
Liver function tests measure chemicals that
are made or processed by the liver. Levels
that are too high or low may be a sign of liver
damage or cancer spread.

Tumor markers
A tumor marker is a substance found in body
tissue or fluid that may be a sign of cancer.
Along with other information, tumor markers
can help diagnose ovarian cancer and monitor
response to treatment.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ovarian Cancer, 2024

14

2 Testing for ovarian cancer » Biomarker testing

Biomarker testing

A cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) test is the most
common tumor marker test for ovarian cancer.
High levels of this protein in the blood may be
a sign of ovarian or other cancers. A CA-125
test alone cannot diagnose ovarian cancer.

Biomarkers are features of the tumor that can
help guide your treatment. They are often
mutations (changes) in the DNA of the cancer
cells. Testing for biomarkers involves analyzing
a piece of tumor tissue in a lab or testing a
sample of blood. The results can be used to
determine whether you can join certain clinical
trials, and whether you may benefit from
specific maintenance therapies.

Health problems that are not cancer, such as
endometriosis and diverticulitis, can raise your
CA-125 level. Some ovarian cancers don’t
cause CA-125 to rise.
Your blood may also be tested for the following
tumor markers. These may be found in higherthan-normal amounts in people with less
common ovarian cancers (LCOCs).

A BRCA mutation is the most important
biomarker used to plan ovarian cancer
treatment. Everyone diagnosed with ovarian
cancer should have the tumor tested for
mutations in the BRCA genes, and in other
similar genes important in DNA repair.
This is different than genetic testing of the
blood for inherited (germline) BRCA mutations.
Mutations in the tumor itself are known as
somatic or simply “tumor” mutations.
BRCA mutations are a form of homologous
recombination deficiency (HRD). This means
that if you have a BRCA mutation, the cancer
is also homologous recombination deficient or
HRD positive. However, you can also have an
HRD-positive tumor without a BRCA mutation.
Other changes in the tumor’s DNA can make
it homologous recombination deficient. The
tumor's BRCA and HRD status are used to

Other biomarkers
The timing of testing for the biomarkers
described next can vary. Some providers test
for these (in addition to BRCA) early in the
treatment process. Others may only test for
BRCA and wait to see if therapies that require
other biomarkers are needed.

However, testing for these biomarkers is
generally recommended for ovarian cancer
that returns after treatment (recurrent). Testing
is performed on removed tumor tissue.

The biopsy to diagnose ovarian cancer is
usually done during initial surgery. If your
team recommends chemotherapy before
surgery, a biopsy will be done before
starting chemotherapy
Ultrasound is often the first imaging test
performed for suspected ovarian cancer.
Blood tests for suspected ovarian cancer
include a CBC, chemistry profile, liver
function tests, and tumor marker tests.
Hereditary ovarian cancer is most often
caused by a mutation in the BRCA genes.
Families with a history of Lynch syndrome
may also be at risk for ovarian and other
cancers.
Everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer
should have genetic testing of the blood
for inherited (germline) BRCA mutations.
Biomarker testing looks for features of
the cancer, such as mutations, that can
help guide your treatment. Everyone
diagnosed with ovarian cancer should
have their tumor tested for mutations in
the BRCA genes and others important in
DNA repair.

The most common surgery for ovarian cancer
is hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy (BSO). A hysterectomy is
surgery to remove the uterus. When the cervix
is removed in addition to the uterus, it is called
a total or complete hysterectomy. A BSO
removes both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.

may be an option for more
advanced cancers.

If cancer has spread outside the ovaries,
your surgeon will attempt to remove as much
of it as possible. This is called debulking
or cytoreductive surgery. The extent of the
surgery depends on how far the cancer has
spread. It may involve removing all or part
of nearby organs. Lymph nodes that look
abnormal or that are larger than normal will
also be removed when possible.

Surgery is often the first treatment if you
are willing and able to have it. Sometimes
chemotherapy is given first.
Surgery should be performed by a gynecologic
oncologist. This is a surgeon who is an
expert in cancers that start in the female
reproductive organs. If your team recommends
chemotherapy before surgery, see page 21.

Fertility-sparing surgery
Pregnancy isn’t possible after the uterus is
removed. This is difficult for those wishing to
get pregnant in the future. Fertility-sparing
surgery may be an option.

The main goals of surgery are to:




Remove all or as much of the cancer as
possible, and

This involves removing one or both ovaries
and fallopian tubes but leaving the uterus in
place. Surgery to remove one ovary and its
fallopian tube is called a unilateral salpingooophorectomy (USO). USO is only an option
if the cancer is in 1 ovary and the cancer is
appropriate for this procedure.

Learn how far the cancer has spread.

Surgical methods

After a USO, you may still be able to become
pregnant naturally if you haven’t entered
menopause.

A laparotomy is the most common method for
ovarian cancer surgery. A laparotomy is a long
surgical cut in the abdomen. It is often an upand-down (vertical) cut from the top of the belly
button down to the pelvic bone.

If the cancer is in both ovaries, a BSO (without
hysterectomy) may be an option. While you
can't become pregnant naturally after a BSO,
pregnancy may be possible using assisted
reproductive approaches. One such approach
is in vitro fertilization (IVF).

This lets your doctor see the tumor and other
organs and tissues in your abdomen and
pelvis. This method is recommended most
often when surgical staging (described next) or
cytoreductive surgery is planned.

In IVF, eggs are fertilized with sperm in a lab
to create embryos. The embryos are implanted
into the uterus or frozen for future use. The
eggs used for IVF may be yours (removed
from your ovary before surgery) or donor
eggs. Donor eggs are removed from women
who have volunteered to go through hormone
treatment to stimulate egg production in the
ovaries.

Less often, a minimally invasive type of
surgery called laparoscopy may be used. The
surgery is performed through a few small cuts
in the abdomen. Laparoscopy may be used in
select cases, such as when cancer is only in
the ovaries. This surgery should only be done
by a gynecologic oncologist experienced in this
method.

Hysterectomy and
BSO
The most commonly
used surgery for
ovarian cancer
removes the uterus,
both ovaries, and both
fallopian tubes.

Surgical staging

After the surgery, expect to stay in the hospital
for a few days or weeks to recover. You may
feel some pain and tenderness in your belly
and pelvis. It may last for a few days or weeks.
You may be able to return to normal activities
in a few weeks. The time it takes to fully
recover varies from person to person. It also
varies depending on the extent of the surgery.

If it does not look like the cancer has spread,
surgical staging should be performed. Surgical
staging is the most accurate way to stage
ovarian cancer. This involves taking samples
during surgery from organs and tissues where
ovarian cancer often spreads. The samples
are tested for cancer cells.

Premature menopause

Your surgeon will also take samples from
nearby tissues where it looks like cancer hasn’t
spread. This is done to check for cancer cells
that have spread outside the ovaries or pelvis
and can only be seen with a microscope.
These are called microscopic metastases.

If you have not entered menopause, surgery
that removes both ovaries will cause it. This
is known as surgical menopause. It is caused
by the sudden drop in estrogen in the body.
This drop can cause symptoms of menopause,
including:

The omentum and sometimes nearby lymph
nodes will be removed. The omentum is the
fatty layer of tissue that covers organs in the
belly (abdomen). Lymph nodes are groups of
disease-fighting cells where cancer can also
spread. If there is fluid buildup in the abdomen,
the fluid will also be sampled. If there isn’t fluid
buildup, your doctor may “rinse” the space
inside your belly with a special liquid. This is
called a peritoneal washing. Samples of the
liquid will then be tested for cancer cells.

Hot flashes



Sleeping problems



Night sweats



Weight gain

Changes in mood



Thinning, drying, and irritation of the
vaginal lining (vaginal atrophy)

When caused by surgery, the symptoms of
menopause may be sudden and more severe.
There are also long-term risks of not having
enough estrogen. They include heart or blood
vessel problems (cardiovascular disease) and
bone loss (osteoporosis).

Preparing for surgery
Your treatment team will give you instructions
on how to prepare for surgery. You may be
asked to stop taking some medicines for a
short time. You also should not eat or drink
after midnight the night before the surgery.

If you have symptoms of surgical menopause,
your doctor may suggest non-hormonal
medicine or hormone replacement therapy
(HRT). Discussion with a menopausal
symptom team is recommended to determine
whether HRT is right for you.

On the day of your surgery, you will be given
medicine to put you into a deep sleep so
you won’t feel pain. This is called general
anesthesia. Surgery may take 3 or more hours
to complete. More or less time may be needed
depending on how much tissue is removed.

Other risks and side effects

an option. The goal of surgery is to remove as
much of the cancer as possible, as well as the
ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus. Surgery
performed after chemotherapy is called interval
cytoreductive surgery (ICS).

With any type of surgery, there are health risks
and side effects. Common side effects include
pain, swelling, and scars. Common side effects
of ovarian cancer surgery include leg swelling,
trouble urinating, and constipation.

For stage 3 disease, hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may
be used during ICS. HIPEC is a technique
in which chemotherapy is warmed and then
circulated in the spaces between the organs of
the abdomen during surgery.

Cancer and recent abdominal surgery are risk
factors for developing blood clots, also known
as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Many patients
are placed on blood thinners (either oral
medications or injections) for up to 4 weeks
after surgery to help prevent blood clots.

If cancer improves after several cycles
of chemotherapy, surgery is usually
recommended. If cancer stays the same,
your doctor may recommend proceeding with
surgery or continuing chemotherapy to see if
there is improvement.

If surgery first isn’t an option
Having surgery first may not be an option.
This could be due to the size or location of the
tumor, other health conditions, or your overall
health. In this case, chemotherapy is given first
to shrink the cancer. You will need a biopsy to
confirm that the tumor is ovarian cancer before
starting chemotherapy.

After surgery, more chemotherapy is usually
given. Maintenance therapy may follow once
your cancer is in remission.

At this time, preferred regimens include:



Paclitaxel and carboplatin
Paclitaxel, carboplatin, bevacizumab, and
maintenance bevacizumab

While the above regimens are preferred,
there are other recommended options for

health. These regimens may change as new
information becomes available.

Staging

Stage 1A

The information gained during surgery
and surgical staging is used to determine
the pathologic (post-surgery) stage. The
pathologic stage provides the most accurate
picture of how far the cancer has spread. It is
used to guide treatment after surgery.

Cancer is in one ovary. The outer sac
(capsule) of the ovary is intact. There is no
cancer on the outside surface of the ovary.
No cancer cells are found in ascites or
washings.

A staging system is a standard way of
describing the extent of cancer in the body.
There are 2 staging systems for ovarian
cancer. One was developed by the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the other
by the International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics (FIGO). They are similar but the
FIGO system is used most often.
In the FIGO system, the cancer stage is
defined by 3 main areas of cancer growth:





The extent of the first (primary) tumor
The spread of cancer to nearby lymph
nodes
The spread of cancer to distant sites

Ovarian cancer stages are numbered from
1 to 4. Doctors write cancer stages as I, II,
III, and IV. The stages are also divided into
smaller groups, called substages. This helps to
describe the extent of cancer in more detail.
The FIGO stages of ovarian cancer are
described on the following pages. Cancers of
the same stage tend to have similar outcomes.
Early-stage cancers tend to have better
outcomes than more advanced cancers. Other
factors not used for staging, such as your
general health, are also important.

3 Treatment for common ovarian cancers » Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy

Six cycles of chemotherapy are recommended
for high-grade serous tumors. Between 3 and
6 cycles are recommended for all other stage 1
tumors. The specific number of cycles needed
depends on the tumor type and other factors.

Chemotherapy is the use of medicine(s) to kill
cancer cells. It is a type of systemic therapy.
When given before surgery, chemotherapy
is called neoadjuvant therapy. When given
after surgery, it is called primary or adjuvant
chemotherapy.

Stages 2, 3, and 4
For common tumor types, chemotherapy is
recommended after surgery for all newly
diagnosed stage 2, 3, and 4 ovarian cancers.

Platinum-based chemotherapy is
recommended for ovarian cancer. These
medicines contain the metal platinum.
Carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin are
examples. One of these is often given with a
different type of chemotherapy called a taxane.
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are taxanes.

At this time, the preferred chemotherapy
regimen is paclitaxel with carboplatin, given
every 3 weeks. Six cycles are given for
stage 2, 3, and 4 cancers. If you can't have
this regimen, there are other recommended
options.

Your options for chemotherapy will depend
on your age and overall health. Your provider
will also consider your risk for nerve damage,
called peripheral neuropathy. This common
side effect of paclitaxel causes pain, tingling,
and numbness, often in the hands and feet.

A drug called bevacizumab (Avastin) may
be added to your chemotherapy. It stops the
growth of new blood vessels that feed the
tumor.

Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment
followed by days of rest. This allows the body
to recover before the next treatment. The
cycles vary in length depending on which
drugs are used.

If chemotherapy works well, the next step may
include maintenance therapy. See page 31 for
more information.

How chemotherapy is given
Most chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is given
intravenously. This means the medicine is put
directly into your bloodstream through a vein.
You may get a port to receive chemotherapy.
This is a small, round disc that is usually
placed under your skin in the upper chest. It
is inserted during a minor surgery and stays
in the body until treatment is complete. After
treatment the port can be easily removed.
Once the port is removed, the skin will heal.

Stage 1
Chemotherapy is recommended after surgery
for most newly diagnosed stage 1 cancers.
Observation may be an option for a stage 1A
or 1B, low-grade tumor. Ask your doctor if this
applies to your cancer.
At this time, the preferred chemotherapy
regimen is paclitaxel with carboplatin, given
every 3 weeks. If you can't have this regimen,
there are other recommended options.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ovarian Cancer, 2024

29

3 Treatment for common ovarian cancers » Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy medicine can also be slowly
injected into the abdomen. This is called
intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. When
given this way, higher doses of the drugs are
delivered directly to the cancer cells in the
belly area. IP chemotherapy is given through
a thin tube called a catheter. The catheter is
usually connected to a port placed inside the
abdomen during surgery.

Side effects
Managing side effects is a shared effort
between you and your care team. It is
important to speak up about bothersome
side effects, such as nausea and vomiting.
Ask about your options for managing or
relieving the effects of treatment.

Monitoring during chemotherapy

More information on nausea and vomiting
is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient Guides for
Cancer app.

Your doctor will monitor how well the
chemotherapy is working and assess for side
effects. Expect to have a physical exam every
1 to 3 cycles. A pelvic and rectovaginal exam
may be done at the same time. Imaging and
blood tests are ordered as needed. Testing
for CA-125 or other tumor markers may be
performed before each cycle of chemotherapy.

Side effects of chemotherapy
Common side effects of chemotherapy include:


Loss of appetite



Nausea and vomiting



Mouth sores



Hair loss



Fatigue



Increased risk of infection



Bleeding or bruising easily



Nerve damage (neuropathy)

which are found in the bowel, mouth, and
blood.
Intraperitoneal chemotherapy tends to cause
more severe side effects than intravenous
chemotherapy. This includes infections, kidney
damage, pain in the belly, and nerve damage.
Rare but serious side effects include
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). Ask your care team
for a full list of common and rare side effects of
the drugs you receive.

The side effects of chemotherapy depend on
the specific medicines being used, the dose,
and other factors. In general, side effects are
caused by the death of fast-growing cells,

Tell your care team about any medications
or supplements you are taking. Some may
interact with chemotherapy.

3 Treatment for common ovarian cancers » Maintenance therapy

Maintenance therapy

If chemotherapy included
bevacizumab

Maintenance therapy is the use of systemic
therapy after successful initial treatment for
ovarian cancer. It can reduce the risk of cancer
returning or extend the time until it returns or
gets worse. Maintenance therapy is an option
for stage 2, 3, and 4 cancers that respond well
to surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy.

For HR deficient cancers and BRCA-mutated
cancers, maintenance therapy with both
bevacizumab and olaparib (a PARP inhibitor)
is a recommended option. If you can't have
olaparib, niraparib is given instead.
For BRCA-mutated cancers, maintenance
therapy with a PARP inhibitor alone is also an
option.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are a newer option
for maintenance therapy after initial treatment.
These oral targeted therapies work best in
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)positive cancers, including those caused by a
BRCA mutation.

Maintenance therapy with bevacizumab alone
is also an option for cancers not caused by
a BRCA mutation, or whose BRCA status is
unknown.

PARP inhibitors currently used for
maintenance therapy after initial treatment of
ovarian cancer include:


Olaparib (Lynparza)



Niraparib (Zejula)



Rucaparib (Rubraca)

If chemotherapy didn’t include
bevacizumab
If you have a BRCA mutation and
chemotherapy didn't include bevacizumab,
maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor
alone is recommended. For some stage 2
cancers with a BRCA mutation, observation
may be an option.

The most common side effects of PARP
inhibitors are similar to those caused by
chemotherapy. They include fatigue, nausea,
vomiting, and low blood cell counts. Rare but
serious side effects include myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML).

If you don't have a BRCA mutation (or have
not had a BRCA test), maintenance therapy
with niraparib or rucaparib may be an option,
especially if the cancer is HRD-positive.
Observation is also an option if there was a
complete response to chemotherapy. This
means there are no signs of cancer in the
body.

Myelodysplastic syndrome is a cancer in which
the bone marrow does not make enough
healthy blood cells. There are abnormal
cells in the blood and/or bone marrow. Acute
myeloid leukemia is a fast-growing disease in
which too many immature white blood cells are
found in the bone marrow and blood. In some
cases MDS can become AML.

3 Treatment for common ovarian cancers » Maintenance therapy

How long does maintenance
therapy last?
The length of maintenance therapy after initial
treatment depends on the specific drug(s).

There isn’t much research on
maintenance therapy with a PARP
inhibitor after initial treatment for
stage 2 ovarian cancer. If your
cancer is stage 2 and you are
eligible for maintenance therapy,
talk to your provider about your
options.

Olaparib alone can be given for up to 2
years. Olaparib + bevacizumab together
can be given for up to 15 months, with the
olaparib continued for up to 2 years total.
Niraparib alone can be given for up to 3 years.
Rucaparib alone can be given for up to 2
years. These recommendations can change
with ongoing research.
Keep in mind that any maintenance therapy
will be stopped if the cancer grows or
spreads. It will also be stopped if the side
effects become too harsh or make it unsafe to
continue.

Surveillance

In addition to surveillance testing, a range of
other care is important for cancer survivors.
See Chapter 5: Survivorship for more
information.

When there are no signs of cancer after
treatment, expect to see your oncologist on a
regular basis for physical and pelvic exams.
First 2 years: Every 2 to 4 months
Next 3 years: Every 3 to 6 months
After 5 years: Once a year

Your provider may order blood and imaging
tests if you develop symptoms or if there are
other reasons to suspect relapse.
If your CA-125 level (or other tumor marker)
was high originally, it may be checked on a
regular basis after treatment.

Platinum-sensitive cancer
If you enter complete remission after platinumbased chemotherapy and cancer returns more
than 6 months later, the cancer is considered
platinum-sensitive. This means that platinumbased chemotherapy drugs work well against
the cancer.

Your doctor may choose to test for even more
biomarkers than those listed.

Ovarian Cancer, 2024

It returns less than 6 months after
successful treatment with platinum-based
chemotherapy.

Because platinum-based chemotherapy
didn’t improve your cancer, a different type
of recurrence treatment is recommended.
Non-platinum chemotherapy is usually given
first. Another preferred option is bevacizumab
(Avastin). This may also be added to your
chemotherapy.

A PARP inhibitor may also be an option for
maintenance therapy, if you haven’t already
been treated with one and there is a BRCA
mutation.

Because it worked well before, platinum
chemotherapy is typically recommended for
recurrent platinum-sensitive disease. This is
especially true for the first recurrence. The
targeted therapy bevacizumab may be added
to chemotherapy.

After successful chemotherapy for recurrent
cancer, maintenance therapy with a PARP
inhibitor can be continued until the cancer
grows or spreads, or until the side effects
make it intolerable or unsafe to continue.
When used after recurrence treatment, the
safety of maintenance therapy with a PARP
inhibitor for longer than 2 years is unknown.

In certain circumstances, before starting
recurrence treatment, your doctor may suggest
surgery to remove all visible cancer. This is
called secondary cytoreductive surgery.
If recurrence treatment with platinumbased chemotherapy works well or very
well, maintenance therapy is an option. If
bevacizumab was included in your recurrence
chemotherapy regimen, it can be continued
alone as maintenance therapy.

Hypersensitivity reactions
With repeat use of carboplatin and/or cisplatin, you are at increased risk of a
hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. This can be life-threatening. If your treatment team
hasn’t brought it up, below are some questions you can ask to learn about this risk.

Endocrine therapy
Estrogen and progesterone are hormones
made by the ovaries until menopause.
Hormones are sometimes offered to help with
symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes.
This is known as menopausal hormone
therapy. It used to be called hormonal
replacement therapy (HRT). This may help
some ovarian cancers grow.

Advance care planning
Talking with your doctor about your
prognosis can help with treatment planning.
If the cancer cannot be controlled or cured,
a care plan for the end of life can be made.
Benefits of advance care planning include:

In some cases, treatment can be used to
block these hormones from working, or to
lower hormone levels. The goal is to help slow
ovarian cancer growth. This is called endocrine

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their

clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.








Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

3 Treatment for common ovarian cancers » Clinical trials

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Finding a clinical trial
In the United States

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

Ovarian cancer is staged during surgery
to remove the cancer. This is called
surgical staging.
For common ovarian tumor types,
platinum-based chemotherapy is
recommended after surgery for most
stage 1 cancers and for all stage 2, 3,
and 4 cancers. A targeted therapy called
bevacizumab may be added.

- Ovarian cancer survivor

Maintenance therapy is recommended
for many stage 2, 3, and 4 cancers that
respond well to initial treatment. PARP
inhibitors are often an option. They work
best in cancers with a BRCA mutation
and/or HRD-positive cancers.
If it was included in chemotherapy,
bevacizumab may be given alone or with
a PARP inhibitor for maintenance therapy.
If not already performed, tumor biomarker
testing is recommended for everyone with
recurrent ovarian cancer.
Clinical trials give people access to
investigational treatments that may, in
time, be approved by the FDA.

recommended.

Clear cell carcinoma

Less common ovarian cancers can start in the
epithelium, in tissues that support the ovaries,
or in the reproductive (egg) cells of the ovary.
If not already done, you may have surgery first
to remove any remaining cancer or to stage
the cancer.

Clear cell carcinomas are the most common
of the less common ovarian cancers. They are
considered high-grade (fast-growing) tumors.
Most don't have estrogen receptors.
Platinum-based chemotherapy is
recommended for most clear cell carcinomas.
A preferred regimen for all stages is paclitaxel
and carboplatin, given every 3 weeks.
For stage 2, 3, or 4 tumors, the targeted
therapy bevacizumab may be given with
chemotherapy. If so, it is often continued as
maintenance therapy.

If receiving treatment as part of a clinical trial
isn’t an option, treatment for less common
ovarian cancers should be individualized.
Whether the cancer has any biomarkers helps
guide treatment decisions. Biomarkers are
features of a cancer, such as gene mutations
(changes).

When chemotherapy is over, follow-up care
will begin for stage 1 tumors. For stage 2, 3, or
4 tumors with a BRCA mutation, maintenance
therapy may follow chemotherapy.

Carcinosarcoma
Carcinosarcomas are the most aggressive
type of ovarian tumor. Fertility-sparing surgery
isn’t a treatment option, regardless of your age
or the cancer stage. These cancers are also
known as malignant mixed Müllerian tumors.

For information on follow-up care and
recurrence, see pages 33 and 34.

Mucinous carcinoma

For stage 1A and 1B tumors, observation
is recommended. Stage 1C tumors may be
observed or treated with systemic therapy.
Chemotherapy is recommended for all stage 2,
3, and 4 mucinous neoplasms. The preferred
chemotherapy regimens are listed in Guide
4.

Mucinous tumors are often found at an earlier
age than more common ovarian cancers.
These tumors can grow so large that they fill
the abdomen and pelvis. Most people have
early-stage disease at the time of diagnosis.
Mucinous tumors usually respond well to
treatment.

For information on follow-up care and
recurrence, see pages 33 and 34.

Testing often involves a check of the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This can help tell the
difference between a true mucinous cancer
of the ovary versus a cancer that may have
spread to the ovary from the GI tract. Blood
tests measuring carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA) and CA 19-9 are recommended.
If not already done, you may have surgery to
remove any remaining cancer and to surgically
stage the cancer.

Grade 1 endometrioid
carcinoma
Testing for a biomarker (feature) called
mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)/
high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is
recommended for all grade 1 endometrioid
carcinomas.

Supportive care is available
for everyone with cancer.
It isn't meant to treat the
cancer, but rather to help
with symptoms and make
you more comfortable.

Stage 1A and 1B tumors are observed without
treatment. While observation is also an option
for stage 1C tumors, these cancers are often
treated with chemotherapy or endocrine
therapy.
For all stage 2, 3, and 4 tumors, treatment with
either chemotherapy or hormonal therapy is
recommended.

Low-grade serous carcinoma

For chemotherapy, paclitaxel and carboplatin
(given every 3 weeks) is recommended. A
targeted therapy called bevacizumab may
be added to chemotherapy for stage 2, 3,
or 4 tumors. If so, it may be continued as
maintenance therapy.

Low-grade serous carcinoma isn’t the same
as the more commonly diagnosed highgrade serous carcinoma. Low-grade serous
carcinomas tend to be diagnosed at an earlier
age. A little over half are linked with borderline
serous tumors, also called low malignant
potential tumors.

If treatment with chemotherapy is planned,
your doctor may suggest maintenance
endocrine therapy afterward.

Observation is recommended for all stage 1A

If treatment with chemotherapy is planned,
your doctor may suggest maintenance
endocrine therapy afterward.

Ovarian serous borderline epithelial tumors
are also called low malignant potential (LMP)
tumors. These rare tumors have cancer-like
features, but don't invade other tissues like
most cancers do.

After treatment
When treatment is over, follow-up visits are
recommended every 2 to 4 months for the first
2 years, then every 3 to 6 months for 3 years.
After year 5, they are scheduled once a year.

Borderline epithelial tumors are slow-growing.
Compared to more invasive types of ovarian
cancer, those diagnosed with a borderline
epithelial tumor tend to be younger and often
have stage 1 disease. They are also often
candidates for fertility-sparing surgery.

Physical exams, including pelvic exam, are
performed as needed. If biomarker testing
hasn't been done yet, it is recommended now.

Surgery is the main treatment for borderline
epithelial tumors. Both standard surgery
and fertility-sparing surgery may be options.
You should be evaluated by a gynecologic
oncologist for this decision.

Physical exams, imaging, and blood tests are
performed as needed. If CA-125 or other tumor
markers were high before treatment, they will
be monitored after treatment.

If cancer remains after prior
surgery

If the cancer returns, treatment options
include:

Prior surgery for a borderline epithelial tumor

case if the cancer wasn’t fully removed, or fully
staged.
If your doctor suspects that cancer remains in
the body, another surgery is recommended if
possible. This may not be possible if you are
otherwise not healthy enough, or if the cancer
can’t be surgically removed.

Biomarker-based targeted therapy (if the
cancer has biomarkers)
Observation

If you want to keep your fertility, fertility-sparing
surgery may be an option. This involves
removing only the ovary with cancer and its
ovarian tube, along with any remaining visible
cancer. This is called a unilateral salpingooophorectomy (USO). For some, removing

both ovaries and fallopian tubes but keeping
the uterus intact may be an option.
If you don’t desire fertility-sparing surgery,
completion surgery (hysterectomy and removal
of the opposite ovary and fallopian tube) is
performed. Any remaining cancer will also be
resected. Removal and testing of lymph nodes
during surgery is considered on a case-bycase basis.

Relapse
The return of cancer after treatment is
called a relapse or a recurrence. In the case
of a relapse, debulking surgery is often
recommended when possible. This surgery
aims to remove all of the cancer that the
surgeon can see.

After surgery (fertility-sparing or completion),
the pathology team will test the removed
tissues. Sometimes the tumor type changes
as a result of this testing. If the final results
confirm that it is borderline, follow-up care is
described next.

The results of surgery may show that the
tumor is a different type than previously
thought. Treatment based on the updated
tumor type is recommended.

Prior complete surgery
If the cancer was completely resected and
no low-grade serous carcinoma was found,
observation is recommended. If low-grade
serous carcinoma was found, more treatment
is recommended.

Follow-up
Physical exams are given every 3 to 12
months for the first 5 years after treatment.
After that, they are given as needed. Your
doctor may also do a pelvic exam at these
visits.
If CA-125 or other tumor marker levels were
high at diagnosis, they should be checked
at each follow-up visit. Other blood tests and
imaging are performed as needed. Imaging
may be ordered if your doctor suspects that
cancer has returned.

surgical staging is recommended. Malignant
germ cell tumors are staged with the same
system used for common ovarian cancers.
In children or adolescents with early-stage
germ cell tumors, full surgical staging may be
skipped.

Although very rare, germ cell tumors are
the most common type of ovarian cancer
diagnosed in people ages 16 to 20 years.
These non-epithelial tumors are usually
diagnosed at the earliest stage and have
excellent treatment outcomes.

After surgery, chemotherapy is recommended
for most malignant germ cell tumors. This
includes:

Types of germ cell tumors include:


Dysgerminomas



Immature teratomas





Some germ cell tumors don't need
chemotherapy after surgery. Observation with
surveillance is recommended for:

Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin
(β-hCG)
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

Treatment
If you want the option of having children
after treatment, fertility-sparing surgery is
recommended. The cancer can be any stage.
Full surgical staging is performed at the same
time.

bleomycin can't be used. Your team will speak
with you about other options.

Surveillance after fertility-sparing surgery

chemotherapy regimens used vary between
cancer centers.
If treatment with TIP or high-dose

Malignant sex cord-stromal
tumors

Stage 2, 3, or 4
For those with a stage 2, 3, or 4 tumor,
treatment options include platinum-based
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Radiation
is an option only if there is a limited amount of
cancer in the body. Otherwise, chemotherapy
is usually given.

Malignant sex cord-stromal tumors are
nonepithelial. These rare tumors include
granulosa cell tumors (most common) and
Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. The prognosis
(outlook) for both types is good. Most people
diagnosed with a malignant granulosa cell
tumor have early-stage disease, and the
cancer is typically slow-growing.

Surveillance
Granulosa cell tumors can return decades
after treatment. Long-term surveillance is
recommended after treatment for these
tumors.

Surgery to stage the cancer is recommended
for malignant sex cord-stromal tumors. Lymph
node dissection (removal) is generally not
included in surgical staging for these tumors.

Physical exams are given as needed based
on the cancer stage. Exams are often given
once or twice a year for early-stage and lowrisk cancers. For high-risk disease, exams are
given more often (about every 4 to 6 months).

If fertility is desired and the cancer hasn't
spread beyond the ovary, fertility-sparing
surgery with full staging is an option instead.
If this is planned, talk to your doctor about
having completion surgery after childbearing
is finished. Completion surgery removes the
uterus and the remaining ovary and fallopian
tube.

Sex cord-stromal tumors, especially granulosa
cell tumors, can make a protein called inhibin.
If the level of inhibin in your blood was high
at the time of diagnosis, your doctor may
continue to check it after treatment. If the level
goes up, it could be a sign of relapse. Keep
in mind that a blood test alone cannot confirm
that the cancer has returned.

Next steps of care depend on the cancer
stage, as determined by surgery. Malignant
sex cord stromal tumors are staged with
the same system used for common ovarian
cancers.

Testing for CA-125 and other tumor markers is
individualized. If your doctor recommends it,
how often the testing is needed is also based
on stage. Blood tests may be ordered once or
twice a year if the cancer is early-stage and
low-risk. For high-risk disease, testing may be
ordered every 4 to 6 months.

Stage 1
Observation is recommended after surgery for
low-risk stage 1 tumors. Medium- or high-risk
stage 1 tumors may be observed or treated
with platinum-based chemotherapy. The
preferred chemotherapy regimen at this time is
paclitaxel and carboplatin.

Other health care
Get other recommended health care for
your age, such as blood pressure screening,
hepatitis C screening, and immunizations
(such as the flu shot).

Diet and exercise
Leading a healthy lifestyle includes maintaining
a healthy body weight. Try to exercise at a
moderate intensity for at least 150 minutes per
week. All patients should have a discussion
with their doctor before starting a new exercise
regimen. Eat a healthy diet with lots of plantbased foods, including vegetables, fruits, and
whole grains.

If you have questions or are curious about
complementary therapies, talk to your
treatment team. Many cancer centers
have integrative oncology programs.
This approach to cancer care combines
conventional (standard) cancer treatment
with complementary and alternative
therapies. Be sure to tell your care team
if you are taking any herbal supplements.
Some can interact with chemotherapy.

Alcohol may increase the risk of certain
cancers. Drink little to no alcohol.

Survivorship focuses on the physical,
emotional, and financial issues unique to
cancer survivors.
Survivorship care is improved if your
oncologist and primary care provider
(PCP) work together to get the long-term
care you need.
A survivorship care plan is helpful in
transitioning your care to your primary
care doctor.
Healthy habits play a key role in helping
to prevent other diseases and second
cancers.
If you have concerns about paying for
your cancer care, financial help may be
available.

relationship with your care team, it will help
you feel supported when considering options
and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:




What you want and how that might differ
from what others want

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Your religious and spiritual beliefs

Support groups



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life and length of life
How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Questions to ask

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your
