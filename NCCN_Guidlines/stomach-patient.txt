About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Gastric Cancer, Version 1.2023 – March 10, 2023.

Stomach cancer basics » The stomach

The stomach is a large, hollow

intestine at a time, the stomach also serves
as a temporary holding chamber. The large
intestine prepares unused food to be moved
out of the body.

organ that secretes enzymes and
acid to aid in the digestion of food.
It is part of the digestive system.

There is not much activity where the stomach
connects to the esophagus and small intestine.
However, the main body of the stomach is very
active during digestion.

The digestive system takes in
food, breaks it down, absorbs the
nutrients, and removes waste from
the body.

The stomach

The digestive system

The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ
located between the esophagus and the small
intestine. It secretes enzymes and acid that
convert what you eat and drink into a liquid
called chyme. When empty, your stomach is
about 10 to 12 inches in size.

The digestive system takes in and breaks down
food, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste
from the body. It includes organs like your liver,
gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, and intestines.

Food and drink enter the mouth and move
through the esophagus into the stomach.
Stomach contractions along with enzymes
and acid break down food into chyme.
From the stomach, chyme enters the small
intestine where nutrients are absorbed into
the bloodstream. Since only small amounts
of chyme are released into the small

Stomach cancer basics » Parts of the stomach

Parts of the stomach

The esophagus joins the stomach just below
the diaphragm at the esophagogastric
junction (EGJ). The diaphragm is the thin
breathing muscle below the lungs and heart
that separates the chest from the abdomen.
The EGJ might be referred to as the
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).

The parts of the stomach include:









Cardia – the opening where the
esophagus connects to the stomach.
Fundus – the upper part of the stomach,
which forms a bulge higher than the
opening of the esophagus (farthest from
the pylorus). It stores undigested food and
gases released from digestion.
Body – the main part of the stomach.
Antrum – the lower portion of the
stomach where food mixes with enzymes
and acid.
Pylorus – connects the stomach
to the first part of the small intestine
(duodenum). The pylorus is a valve
that opens and closes during digestion.
This allows partly digested food and
other stomach contents to pass from the
stomach to the small intestine.

Parts of the stomach
The parts of the stomach include
the cardia, the fundus, the body, the
antrum, and the pylorus. The stomach
is part of the digestive system. Many
lymph nodes can be found along the
lesser and greater curvatures of the
stomach.

Stomach cancer basics » Stomach wall

Stomach wall

•

The stomach is made up of several layers.
The inner and outer layers are membranes.
A membrane is a very thin layer that covers
a surface. In between these membranes are
layers of muscle and connective tissue.



The wall of the stomach is made of 5 main
layers.




Mucosa – Inner membrane that is in
contact with food. It consists of 3 layers:
•

•



Surface epithelium – A thin, moist layer
of cells that forms the interior stomach
lining. Epithelium makes a sticky, thick
liquid called mucus that protects the
stomach.



Lamina propria – A type of connective
tissue found under the epithelium
membrane. Within and supported by
the lamina propria are stomach glands
formed by cells that have the functions
of producing enzymes, acid, mucus, and
hormones.

Layers of the
stomach wall
The wall of the stomach is
made up of 5 layers: mucosa,
submucosa, muscle layer,
subserosa, and serosa.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Stomach Cancer, 2023

7

Muscularis mucosae – A thin strip of
muscle that separates the mucosa from
the submucosa.

Submucosa – A layer of connective
tissue, blood vessels, and nerve cells. It
also contains larger lymph vessels and
channels.
Muscle – A type of soft tissue that helps
move food through the stomach. It is also
called muscularis propria.
Subserosa – A layer of connective tissue
that supports the serosa.
Serosa – An outer membrane that covers
the stomach. The serosa is also called the
serous membrane. This membrane allows
the stomach to move smoothly against
other organs.

Stomach cancer
Most stomach (gastric) cancers start in the
cells that line the inside of the stomach
and make mucus. These are called
adenocarcinomas. Almost all stomach cancers
are adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas of
the stomach are the focus of this book.

When my dad was told he had 6
months to live in 2013, we were
devastated. But instead of giving
in, we created a team of experts
that helped us navigate through
this terrible prognosis. Today, my
dad is clinically cured. My advice
to those newly diagnosed is to
be your own advocate and find a
support community."

There are 2 major types of stomach
adenocarcinomas.




Intestinal – Cells of the intestinal type
stick together and form tube- and glandshaped structures. This type is more likely
to have mutations that can be treated with
targeted therapy.
Diffuse – Cells of the diffuse type don’t
stick together and appear scattered over
a wide area that can't be easily seen on
the surface. This type is less common.

Treatment is based on the type of stomach
cancer and the location of the tumor.

Esophageal cancer
Tumors that start in the cardia of the stomach
and cross over into the area between the
esophagus and stomach (esophagogastric
junction) are treated as esophageal cancers.
More information on esophageal cancer is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Stomach cancer basics » How stomach cancer spreads

How stomach cancer
spreads

Those with stomach cancer can be grouped
into 3 main categories, depending on how far
the cancer has spread.

Stomach cancer starts in the innermost layer
and grows outward through the layers of the
stomach wall. Cancer can spread to nearby
lymph nodes, veins, arteries, and organs such
as the liver, pancreas, and spleen. It might also
grow into nearby lymphatic or blood vessels,
and from there spread to nearby lymph nodes
or to other parts of the body. Stomach cancer
can also grow inwards and form an ulcer or
masses that can cause symptoms.





Stomach cancers tend to develop slowly over
many years. Before cancer develops, precancerous changes often occur in the inner
lining (mucosa) of the stomach. Since these
early changes rarely cause symptoms, they
often go undetected.



Cancer in regional
lymph nodes
In locoregional or locally
advanced stomach cancer,
cancer may have spread to
the lymph nodes near the
stomach.

Early-stage stomach cancer has not
grown beyond the first layer (mucosa) of
the stomach wall. The tumor is often small
(2 centimeters or less) and is not in any
lymph nodes.
Locoregional or locally advanced
stomach cancer has invaded other
layers of the stomach wall and/or spread
to the lymph nodes or organs near the
stomach.

Metastatic stomach cancer has
spread to other parts of the body. The
most common metastatic sites are the
liver, abdominal lining (peritoneum), and
distant lymph nodes. It may also spread
to the lungs or bone.

nearby (regional) lymph nodes. Cancer
can also grow inside the stomach and
form an ulcer or mass.
Cancer can spread to distant parts of
the body through the blood or lymphatic
system. This is called metastatic stomach
cancer. A distant metastasis could be
in the liver, abdominal lining, or distant
lymph nodes.

Test results
Results from imaging studies and biopsy
(including biomarker tests) will be used to
determine your treatment plan. Treatment will
be based on these findings.


It is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions and keep copies of your
test results. Online patient portals are a great
way to access your test results.
Keep these things in mind:










Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.



Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.

In your contact list, include information on
your exact type of cancer, as well as any
treatments and the date each treatment
started.

For possible tests, see Guide 1.

Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.
Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.

Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.

interact and affect medicines that your care
team may prescribe. Tell your care team about
any symptoms you have. A medical history,
sometimes called a health history, will help
determine which treatment is best for you.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. If there is a history of
H. pylori (bacteria) infection and/or treatment,
it is important to let the medical team know.
Bring a list of old and new medicines and any
over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, herbals,
or supplements you take. Some supplements

Family history
Some cancers and other diseases can run in
families. Your doctor will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members on both sides of

Testing for stomach cancer » Blood tests » Imaging tests

Blood tests

Imaging tests

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein. Some
blood tests are described next.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Imaging tests show the primary
tumor, or where the cancer started, and look
for cancer in other parts of your body.
A radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report to
your health care provider (HCP). It is likely that
the report will be sent directly to you through
your patient portal or patient access system.
You should discuss these results with your
HCP.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures
the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in
your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells fight
infection, and platelets control bleeding.

You will not have all of these tests.

CT scan

Comprehensive metabolic panel

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your chest,
abdomen, and/or pelvis may be one of the
tests to look for cancer. Oral (by mouth) and
intravenous (IV) contrast are often used
together when testing for stomach cancer.

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures 14 different substances in your
blood. It is usually done on the plasma part
of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.

CA 19-9 and CEA
Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are
occasionally made by tumors and can be
detected in the blood. These tumor markers
may be followed if elevated at the time of
diagnosis.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that
help enhance and improve the images of
several organs and structures in the body. It is
used to make the pictures clearer. The contrast
is not permanent and will leave the body in
your urine immediately after the test. The types
of contrast vary and are different for CT and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is

of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called
glucose. You cannot eat or drink for at least
4 hours before the scan. This scan is most
helpful when other imaging results are unclear.
It may help find cancer in lymph nodes and
distant sites. If it clearly shows cancer in the
bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride PET/
CT may not be needed. FDG PET/CT can
be done at the same time as a CT used for
diagnosis.

important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

PET scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive sugar molecule called a
tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a
vein to see where cancer spots might be in
the body and if they are using sugar produced
by the body to grow. Cancer spots show up
as bright areas on PET scans. However, not
all tumors will appear on a PET scan and not
all bright spots are cancer. It is normal for the
brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright
on the PET scan. Inflammation or infection can
also show up as a bright spot. When a PET
scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/
CT scan.

Ultrasound
An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to a sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer)
will be held and moved on your skin using
a gel. Ultrasound is painless and does not
use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed.
Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of
cancer that are near the skin. Sometimes, an
ultrasound is used to guide a biopsy.

FDG PET/CT
An FDG PET/CT uses a radiotracer called
F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made

A CT machine is large
and has a tunnel in
the middle. During the
test, you will lie on the

Testing for stomach cancer » Endoscopy procedures

Endoscopy procedures

Upper GI endoscopy or EGD

Some imaging tests use a thin, tube-shaped
tool called a scope that is inserted into the
body to take pictures. One end of the scope
has a small light and camera lens to see inside
your body. The image is sent to a television
or computer monitor. This will help guide your
doctor in a biopsy, stent placement, or other
tasks. The scope is guided into the body
through a natural opening, such as the mouth,
nose, or anus. It may also be inserted through
a small surgical cut.

In an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy
or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD),
a device is guided down the throat into the
esophagus, stomach, and upper parts of
the small intestine (duodenum). An EGD is
used to inspect the lining of these organs
and to look for any signs of cancer or other
abnormalities such as enlarged blood vessels
or ulcers. An EGD can also be referred to as a
duodenoscopy.
Your doctor will record where the tumor is in
your stomach or esophagus. If the tumor is
near the esophagus, the distance from the
esophagogastric junction (EGJ) may also be
recorded. The EGJ is a muscle found just
beneath the diaphragm. After the endoscopy,
your throat may feel sore and you may have
some swelling.

More than one type of scope may be used for
imaging tests. The type of scope often used
for stomach cancer is called an endoscope.
An endoscope is often guided into the body
through the mouth. Endoscopy is an important
tool in the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and
care of those with stomach cancer. Before an
endoscopy, you will be given medicine to help
you relax or sleep during the procedure.

Laparoscopy
Laparoscopy (key-hole surgery) is a type
of surgical procedure that allows your
surgeon to see the inside of your abdomen.
It uses a tool like an endoscope called a
laparoscope. For this test, the laparoscope
will be inserted through a tiny cut in your
abdomen. Laparoscopy is done under general
anesthesia. This is a controlled loss of
wakefulness from drugs.

Endoscopic ultrasound
An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) uses both
imaging and an endoscope to see how deep
the tumor has grown into the stomach wall.
Signs of cancer within lymph nodes and other
nearby organs can also be detected. An EUS
is an important part of cancer diagnosis and
staging.

Laparoscopy may only be used in certain
cases. It can be used to determine the stage
of disease and rule out metastasis. It can
detect cancer spread inside your abdomen
that may have been missed on imaging scans.
It can also be used to obtain biopsy samples.
Sometimes, laparoscopy is used to determine
if you are a candidate for surgery.

You are most likely to have an endoscopic
ultrasound if your care team suspects that the
cancer hasn’t grown far into the stomach wall
(early-stage disease), or to determine whether
the cancer is early stage or locally advanced.

different sizes to remove a sample of
tissue or fluid. An ultrasound (US) may
guide the FNA for diagnosis.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of
bacteria that infects the digestive system. It
puts a person at risk of developing stomach
cancer. If H. pylori is suspected, then you
might have testing. Testing for H. pylori can be
done using a blood or breath test, using a stool
(poop) sample, or during an endoscopy.





Biopsy



A biopsy removes a sample of tissue or fluid
during an endoscopy. Several samples may
be taken from the tumor, wall of your stomach
or esophagus, lymph nodes, or organs next to
your stomach, such as your liver. The samples
will be sent to a pathologist, an expert in
examining cells under a microscope to find
disease.

Liquid biopsy uses a sample of blood
for testing.

A metastasis is the spread of cancer to an
area of the body such as the lining of the
abdomen (peritoneum) or liver. A biopsy of
the metastasis may be needed to confirm the
presence of cancer. If there is more than one
metastasis, each site may be biopsied. The
type of biopsy used depends on the location of
the suspected metastases and other factors.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or
core biopsy (CB) uses needles of

Upper endoscopy

doctor to see the inner wall of
your stomach and esophagus.
If ultrasound is used, your
doctor will be able to see the
deeper wall layers and nearby
organs.

Fluid samples from ascites (fluid in
abdominal cavity) can be used to look for

of metastatic stomach cancer. Biomarker
testing continues to expand, so please ask
your care team if additional tests are needed.

Histology is the study of the anatomy
(structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under
a microscope. It is used to make treatment
decisions. Your pathology report will contain
information about tumor histology. You may
be recommended to have an open biopsy
(surgery) to remove (excise) the tumor to
confirm its histology. Talk to your health care
provider for more information on next steps.

HER2
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. It is found on the surface of all cells.
When amounts are high, it causes cells to
grow and divide. This is called HER2-positive
(HER2+), overexpression, or amplification.

Biomarker testing

There might be higher amounts of HER2 in
your stomach cancer. If your tumor makes
too much HER2, you might receive a targeted
therapy called trastuzumab (Herceptin) or
a biosimilar, or trastuzumab deruxtecan
(Enhertu). A biosimilar is an almost identical
version of a drug made by another company. It
is used in the exact same way and at the same
dose as the actual drug.

A sample from a biopsy of your tumor
may be tested to look for specific DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations,
protein levels, or other molecular features.
This information will be used to choose the
best treatment for you. It is sometimes called
molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor
sequencing, gene expression profiling, or
genomic testing.

MSI-H/dMMR mutation

Biomarker testing includes tests of genes
or their products (proteins). It identifies the
presence or absence of mutations and certain
proteins that might suggest needed treatment.
Proteins are written like this: NTRK. Genes
are written with italics like this: NTRK. Your
treatment team will recommend the best types
of biomarker testing for you.

Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of
DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are
fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.
Some cancers have DNA mutations for
changes that prevent these errors from being
fixed. This is called microsatellite instability
(MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).
When cancer cells have more than a normal
number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H
(microsatellite instability-high). This is often
due to dMMR genes.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), or next-generation sequencing
(NGS) are types of tests used to look for
biomarkers.

Those with newly diagnosed stomach cancer
should be tested for MMR or MSI.

Testing for HER2 status, microsatellite (MS)
status, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expression, and neurotrophic tropomyosinrelated kinase (NTRK) gene fusions are
important for the treatment and management

Testing for stomach cancer » Biomarker testing

PD-L1 testing

Testing is done using a variety of methods
such as fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), and/or
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an
immune protein. If this protein is expressed
on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause
your immune cells to ignore the cancer and
suppress the anti-tumor immune response. If
your cancer expresses this protein, you might
have treatment that combines chemotherapy
and a checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This is
designed to activate your immune system to
better fight off the cancer cells.

Certain mutations such as NTRK, RET, and
BRAF V600E can be targeted with specific
therapies.

NTRK gene fusions
In a tumor with an NTRK gene fusion, a piece
of the NTRK gene and a piece of another
gene fuse or join. This activates the NTRK
gene in a way that causes uncontrolled cell
growth. Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) and entrectinib
(Rozlytrek) might be used to target advanced
or metastatic cancer that is NTRK gene fusionpositive.

RET gene fusions
Rearranged during transfection (RET) gene
mutation is related to cell growth (proliferation).
Selpercatinib (Retevmo) might be used to
target unresectable or metastatic tumors with a
RET fusion.

BRAF V600E mutations

Tumor mutational burden

Mutations in the BRAF gene can cause
normal cells to become cancerous. Dabrafenib
(Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist) might be
used for tumors with BRAF V600E mutations.

When there are 10 or more mutations per
million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H).
Metastatic or unresectable TMB cancers
are often treated using immune checkpoint
inhibitors that target the proteins called
programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).

FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a testing method that involves special dyes
called probes that attach to pieces of DNA, the
genetic material in a person’s cells.

Tumor mutation testing
Tumor mutation testing or tumor genomic
aberration testing uses a sample of your tumor
or blood to see if the cancer cells have any
specific DNA mutations. This is a different type
of DNA testing than the genetic testing for
mutations you may have inherited from your
biological parents. In tumor mutation testing,
only the tumor is tested and not the rest of
your body. Tumor mutation testing is frequently
done if a cancer is unresectable or metastatic.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special

chemical marker to cancer or immune cells.
The cells are then studied using a microscope.

PCR
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab

Tumor markers
Your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested for
proteins. Examples of some tumor markers
in stomach cancer include cancer antigen
19-9 (CA 19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA). An increase in the level of certain
tumor markers could mean that the cancer has
grown or spread (progressed). However, not
everyone has elevated levels of these markers
and tumor markers alone are not a reliable
method of detecting stomach cancer.

Liquid biopsy
Some mutations can be found by testing
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood.
In a liquid biopsy, a sample of blood is taken
to look for cancer cells or for pieces of DNA
from tumor cells. Those who have metastatic
or advanced stomach cancer and are unable
to undergo a traditional biopsy might have a
liquid biopsy. Sometimes, testing can quickly
use up a tumor sample. In this case, a liquid
biopsy might be an option.

Genetic risk testing

Hereditary cancer predisposition
syndromes

You might be thinking, "Why did I get cancer?"
Most of the time, the answer is that one cell
made a mistake when dividing and then a
cancer formed. Some cells, however, have a
predisposition or have something in their DNA
(genetic material) that makes them more likely
to develop cancer. Understanding whether
you have a cancer predisposition condition
can sometimes affect your cancer treatment,
but more often, it can affect screening for
other cancers. Therefore, identifying a cancer
predisposition condition is important.

Certain genetic (inherited) syndromes may
put someone at risk for developing stomach
cancer. A syndrome is a group of signs or
symptoms that occur together and suggest the
presence of or risk for a disease.
Hereditary syndromes most closely related to
stomach cancer include:

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup). The goal is to look for
gene mutations inherited from your biological
parents called germline mutations. Some
mutations can put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. You can pass these genes
on to your children. Also, family members
might carry these mutations. Tell your care
team if there is a family history of cancer.

Performance status
Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be rated
using a PS scale called Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) or the Karnofsky
Performance Score (KPS). PS is one factor
taken into consideration when choosing
a treatment plan. Your preferences about
treatment are always important.

A genetic risk assessment will identify if you
carry a cancer risk and if you may benefit
from genetic testing, additional screening, or
preventive interventions. Depending on the
genetic risk assessment, you might undergo
genetic testing and genetic counseling.

Stomach cancer staging » How stomach cancer is staged

Cancer staging is used to reflect



prognosis and to guide treatment
decisions. It describes the size



and location of the tumor, if the
tumor has grown through the
layers of the stomach wall, and



if cancer has spread to lymph
nodes, organs, or other parts of



the body.

A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging.





Information gathered during staging:

Biomarker testing: Does the cancer
have any genes, proteins, markers, or
mutations that might suggest treatment?

Anatomic – based on extent of cancer
as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node
status (N), and distant metastasis (M).
Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM
plus tumor grade and the status of the
biomarkers such as human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The
prognostic stage also includes the
assumption that you are treated with the
standard-of-care approaches.

Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and
pathologic. Stomach cancer staging is often
done twice, before and after surgery. Staging
after surgery provides more specific and
accurate details about the size of the cancer
and lymph node status.

The extent (size) of the tumor (T):
How large is the cancer? Has it grown
into nearby areas?
The spread to nearby lymph nodes
(N): Has the cancer spread to nearby
lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where?

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Stomach Cancer, 2023

Grade of the cancer (G): How much
do the cancer cells look like normal cells?

Staging includes:

Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A
prognosis is the course your cancer will likely
take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.



Human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) status: Does the
cancer make too much of a protein called
HER2?

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins. Doctors may
explain your cancer stage in different ways
than described next.

The spread (metastasis) to distant
sites (M): Has the cancer spread to

Stomach cancer staging » How stomach cancer is staged

Clinical stage

5 layers of the
stomach wall

Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before
any treatment. It is based on a physical exam,
biopsy, and imaging tests. An example might
look like cN2 or cM1. In stomach cancer, the
clinical (before surgery) stage is based on
the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and other
imaging or biopsy results. These tests are
done before any treatment as part of an initial
diagnosis. Surgery is needed to know exactly
how much cancer is in the body.

1. Mucosa – Inner membrane that is in
contact with food. Mucosa consists of 3
layers:

Pathologic stage
Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is
determined by examining tissue removed
during surgery. An example might be pN2. If
you are given drug therapy before surgery,
then the stage might look like ypT3. The
pathologic (after surgery) stage is based on
information gained after surgery to remove
all or part of the stomach and nearby lymph
nodes. This gives a more accurate picture of
how far the cancer has spread and is used to
determine your treatment options after surgery.
The removal of tumor tissue and nearby
lymph nodes is an important part of pathologic
staging.

¬

Surface epithelium – A thin, moist
layer of cells that forms the interior
stomach lining.

¬

Lamina propria – A type of
connective tissue found under the
epithelium membrane. Within and
supported by the lamina propria
are stomach glands formed by
cells that have the functions of
producing enzymes, acid, mucus,
and hormones.

¬

Muscularis mucosae – A thin
strip of muscle that separates the
mucosa from the submucosa.

2. Submucosa – A layer of connective
tissue, blood vessels, and nerve cells.
3. Muscle – A type of soft tissue that helps
move food through the stomach. Also
called muscularis propria.
4. Subserosa – A layer of connective
tissue that supports the serosa.
5. Serosa – An outer membrane that
covers the stomach. The serosa is also
called the serous membrane or visceral
peritoneum.

Stomach cancer staging » TNM scores

TNM scores



The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage stomach cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different areas
of cancer growth. Based on cancer test results,
your doctor will assign a score or number to
each letter. The higher the number, the larger
the tumor or the more the cancer has spread.
These scores will be combined to assign the
cancer a stage. A TNM example might look like
this: T3N2M0 or T3, N2, M0.








T (tumor) – Depth and spread of the
main (primary) tumor in the stomach wall
N (node) – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes

N = Regional lymph node
There are hundreds of lymph nodes
throughout your body. They work as filters to
help fight infection and remove harmful things
from your body. Regional lymph nodes are
found near the stomach. Cancer found in a
regional lymph node is called a lymph node
metastasis. This is different than a distant
metastasis, which is found far from the main
tumor in the stomach.

M (metastasis) – If cancer has
spread to distant parts of the body or
metastasized

A tumor can grow through the layers of the
stomach wall and into nearby structures.











T0 – No tumor is found.

Lymph drains from the stomach wall into
lymphatic vessels in the mucosa and
submucosa. From here it drains into lymph
nodes outside the stomach. There are
several groups of regional lymph nodes that
drain the wall of the stomach. They include
pyloric (pylorus area of stomach), perigastric,
pericardiac at the esophagogastric junction,
and lymph nodes near organs and arteries
such as the pancreas, spleen (splenic), and
liver (hepatic).

Tis – Carcinoma in situ (cancer has not
grown beyond the epithelium).
T1a – Tumor invades the lamina propria
or muscularis mucosae of the first layer of
the stomach wall (the mucosa).
T1b – Tumor invades the second layer of
the stomach wall (the submucosa).
T2 – Tumor invades the third layer of the
stomach wall (the muscle layer called
muscularis propria).

The largest group of stomach lymph nodes are
the perigastric lymph nodes found along the
lesser and greater curves of the stomach and
in the omenta. The omentum is a fold of the
thin tissue that lines the abdomen (peritoneum)

T3 – Tumor penetrates the subserosa
connective tissue between the third and
outer layer of the stomach wall. It has not
reached the serosa or nearby structures.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Stomach Cancer, 2023

T4b – Tumor has grown all the way
through the stomach wall and into nearby
structures, such as the diaphragm, liver,
spleen, pancreas, adrenal gland, kidney,
colon, small intestine, and abdominal wall.

Carcinoma in situ and T1a tumors are often
considered early-stage cancer. This is cancer
that has not grown beyond the first layer of
the stomach wall. Stomach cancers are rarely
found this early.

T = Tumor

T4a – Tumor invades the outer layer of
the stomach wall (the serosa called the
visceral peritoneum).



The removal of lymph nodes is called lymph
node or nodal dissection. At least 16 regional
nodes should be removed and tested.
However, the removal of more than 30 regional
lymph nodes is advised.


N1 – 1 or 2 nearby nodes have cancer.



N2 – 3 to 6 nearby nodes have cancer.





Numbered stages
Numbered stages are based on TNM scores.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with
4 being the most advanced. They might be
written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III,
and stage IV.

N0 – There is no cancer in nearby lymph
nodes.



Other terms might be used instead of
numbered cancer stages. This book will use
the following terms to describe stomach
cancer:

N3a – 7 to 15 nearby lymph nodes have
cancer.



N3b – 16 or more nearby lymph nodes
have cancer.



M = Metastasis
Cancer that has spread to distant parts of the
body is shown as M1. The most common site
for metastasis is the liver, abdominal lining,
and distant lymph nodes.



Grade
Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells
look under a microscope (called histology).
Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread
faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means
the grade can’t be determined, followed by G1,
G2, and G3. Well differentiated (G1) means
the cancer cells look similar to normal cells.
Poorly differentiated (G3) means the cancer
cells look very different compared to normal
cells. G3 is the highest grade for stomach
(gastric) cancers.


GX – Grade cannot be determined



G1 – Well differentiated



G2 – Moderately differentiated

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Stomach Cancer, 2023

G3 – Poorly differentiated or
undifferentiated



29

Resectable – Tumor can be removed
completely with surgery.
Unresectable – Tumor cannot be
removed with surgery. It might involve
nearby veins and arteries making it
unsafe to remove.
Locoregional or locally advanced –
Tumor might be any size and could be in
any layer of the stomach. Cancer might
be in nearby lymph nodes, organs, and
tissues.
Metastatic – Cancer that has spread to
other parts of the body, including distant
lymph nodes. The most common sites are
the liver, abdominal lining (peritoneum),
and distant lymph nodes. It may also
spread to the lung or bone.

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. Often, surgery
is the main or primary treatment to remove the
cancer from the stomach. This is only one part
of a treatment plan. Surgery can also provide
supportive care by easing pain or discomfort.
This is called palliative surgery.

A history of smoking or vaping nicotine
increases your chances of developing
lung and other cancers. Smoking and
vaping can limit how well cancer treatment
works and prevents wound healing. It
also greatly increases your chances
of having side effects during and after
surgery. Cannabis use might also affect
the amount of anesthesia used during
surgery.

When preparing for surgery, seek the opinion
of an experienced surgeon. The surgeon
should be an expert in performing your type of
surgery. Surgery for stomach cancer should
be done at a high-volume center that does
at least 15 to 20 stomach surgeries each
year. Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating stomach cancer.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that
makes you want to keep smoking and
vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging
for most people who smoke or vape. The
stress of having cancer may make it even
harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask
your care team about counseling and
medicines to help you quit.

The removal of the cancer through surgery can
be accomplished in different ways depending
on the specific circumstances, such as the
size and location of the tumor, and if there is
cancer in any surrounding organs and tissues.
Surgery is based on the safest and best way to
remove the cancer.

Open surgery

•

SmokeFree.gov

Open surgery or laparotomy removes tissue
through one large surgical cut below your
ribs. The large cut lets your surgeon directly
view and access the tumor in your stomach
to remove it. Open surgery may take several
hours or longer. After the surgery, you will
need to stay in the hospital for several days or
longer to recover.

Treating stomach cancer » Surgery

Minimally invasive surgery

You may receive treatment before surgery
called neoadjuvant or preoperative therapy.
Neoadjuvant therapy will help reduce the size
of the tumor and the amount of cancer in the
body.

Minimally invasive surgery (key-hole
surgery) uses a few small incisions. Small
tools are inserted through each incision to
perform the surgery. One of the tools, called
a laparoscope, is a long tube with a video
camera at the end. The camera lets your
surgeon see your stomach and other tissues
inside your abdomen. Other tools are used to
remove the tumor. Laparoscopic surgery can
also be done using robotic arms to control the
surgical tools. This is called robot-assisted
laparoscopic surgery.

Surgical margins
The goal of surgery is a cancer-free surgical
margin. After surgery, you may receive
treatment such as radiation, chemoradiation,
or systemic therapy to kill any remaining
cancer cells.


Tumor resection
The removal of the tumor is called tumor
resection. Imaging tests will be ordered to see
if your cancer is resectable (can be removed
completely by surgery) or unresectable
(cannot be removed completely by surgery).
Sometimes, imaging tests cannot clearly show
one way or the other.





Goal of surgery

In an R1 resection, the surgeon
removes all the visible tumor, but the
microscopic margins are still positive for
tumor cells. This can happen despite best
efforts.
In an R2 resection, the surgeon is
unable to remove all the visible tumor or
there is metastatic disease.

Your surgeon will look carefully for cancer
not only along the surgical margin, but in
other nearby areas. Despite best efforts, it is
not always possible to find all of the cancer.
Sometimes, surgeons can’t safely remove the
tumor with a cancer-free margin.

The goal of surgery or tumor resection is to
remove all of the cancer. To do so, the tumor
is removed along with a rim of normal-looking
tissue around its edge called the surgical
margin. The surgical margin may look normal
during surgery, but cancerous cells may be
found when viewed under a microscope by a
pathologist. A clear or negative margin (R0) is
when no cancer cells are found in the tissue
around the edge of the tumor. In a positive
margin, cancer cells are found in normallooking tissue around the tumor. If there is
a positive margin, you may require another
surgery to try to remove the remaining tumor
cells. Surgery includes removal of lymph
nodes.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Stomach Cancer, 2023

In a clear or negative margin (R0),
no cancerous cells are found in the tissue
around the edge of the tumor.

An intraoperative pathology consultation
is often used by surgeons. This includes
inspecting the resected stomach for cancer
location and distance to surgical margins,
examining by microscope frozen sections of
margins, and examining by microscope for
possible intra-abdominal metastasis such as
liver or peritoneal metastasis. Intraoperative
pathology consultation serves an important
role in guiding the surgery. For more

information about these results, ask your care
team.

Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)
is a procedure to remove pre-cancerous,
early-stage cancer or other abnormal tissues
(lesions) from the stomach. During EMR, the
endoscope is passed down your throat to
reach the lesion or tumor in your stomach.
The lesion can be removed through suction
or cutting it away. Talk to your doctor to learn
more.

After surgery, you may receive treatment
such as radiation or systemic therapy to kill
any remaining cancer cells. You might have
more than one surgery. You might also have
a wound drain to prevent fluid from collecting
in the body after surgery. These drains are
usually removed a few days after surgery.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection
(ESD) uses an endoscope to locate the tumor
in the stomach wall. A tool is inserted through
the endoscope that injects fluid between the
tumor and layer of the stomach wall. Then
a tool lifts and cuts away the tumor from the
stomach wall.

Endoscopic resection
For early-stage stomach cancer, endoscopic
mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic
submucosal dissection (ESD) might be
options. Early-stage stomach cancer has not
grown beyond the first layer (mucosa) of the
stomach wall. The tumor is often very small (2
centimeters or less) and is not in any lymph
nodes.

Partial gastrectomy
In a proximal gastrectomy,
the top half of the stomach
is removed. In a distal
gastrectomy, the bottom half
of the stomach is removed.

Distal gastrectomy

Treating stomach cancer » Gastrectomy

Gastrectomy

Partial gastrectomy

A gastrectomy removes all or part of the
stomach. Surgery that removes part of the
stomach is called gastric resection. Gastric
resection should include the removal of
regional lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy). A
nutritionist or dietician provides guidance on
what foods are most suitable for you before
and after surgery.

In a partial or subtotal gastrectomy, the part
of the stomach with cancer is removed along
with nearby lymph nodes, and possibly parts
of other organs near the tumor. In a proximal
gastrectomy, the top half of the stomach is
removed. In a distal gastrectomy, the bottom
half of the stomach is removed.

Esophagogastrectomy

There are different types of gastrectomy.

In an esophagogastrectomy, the top part of the
stomach and lower part of the esophagus are
removed.

Total gastrectomy
In a total gastrectomy, the whole stomach,
nearby lymph nodes, and parts of your
esophagus and small intestine are removed.
The esophagus is reconnected to the small
intestine. You will have a working digestive
system that allows swallowing, eating, and
digesting food, but in a much different way.

Total gastrectomy
In a total gastrectomy, the whole
stomach and surrounding lymph
nodes are removed. The esophagus
is reattached to the middle part of the
small intestine (jejunum).

Treating stomach cancer » Lymph node dissection

Lymph node dissection



The removal of lymph nodes or groups of
lymph nodes is called lymph node or nodal
dissection. It might be referred to as a
lymphadenectomy. Lymph node dissection
may be classified as D0, D1, or D2 depending
on the location of the tumor and the number
of lymph nodes removed at the time of
gastrectomy.




D0 is an incomplete resection of lymph
nodes along the lesser and greater
curvature of the stomach. This means
some lymph nodes were removed, but not
the minimum of 16.
D1 is the removal of at least 16 lymph
nodes including the greater and lesser
omenta. The omentum is a fold of the
thin tissue that lines the abdomen
(peritoneum). It surrounds the stomach
and other organs in the abdomen. Several
regional lymph nodes are found within the
omenta.

Lymph nodes
At least 16 regional nodes
should be removed and
tested for cancer. However,
the removal of more than
30 regional lymph nodes is
recommended.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Stomach Cancer, 2023

38

D2 is the removal of at least 30 lymph
nodes. This involves D1 dissection plus
the removal of all the lymph nodes along
the left gastric (stomach) artery, common
hepatic (liver) artery, celiac artery, and
splenic (spleen) artery. This requires an
experienced surgeon. D2 dissections
should be performed in centers
experienced with this technique.

Other procedures

Gastrojejunostomy

Gastrojejunostomy

A tumor can block the esophagus or small
intestine. Surgery that reroutes the path food
takes from the stomach to the small intestine
is called a gastrojejunostomy.

A gastrojejunostomy is a surgery to reroute
the path food takes from the stomach into
the small intestine. The new path from the
stomach will avoid (bypass) the blocked part
of the duodenum. A gastrojejunostomy can
be an open surgery or laparoscopic surgery.
You might have a venting gastrostomy
(gastrostomy tube or G-tube) and jejunostomy
tube (J-tube) placement at the time of
gastrojejunostomy.

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_showing_before_and_

G-tube
A gastrostomy tube (G-tube) is a soft, plastic
tube placed through the skin of the abdomen
directly into the stomach. It allows air and
fluid to leave the stomach and can be used
to give medicines and fluids, including liquid
food. Giving food through a gastrostomy tube
is a type of enteral nutrition. It is also called a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)
tube.

J-tube
A jejunostomy tube (J-tube) is a soft, plastic
tube placed through the skin of the abdomen
into the midsection of the small intestine. The
tube delivers food and medicine until you are
healthy enough to eat by mouth. A J-tube is
possible with a gastrojejunostomy. You will
learn how to care for the J-tube and the skin
where the tube enters the body.

Treating stomach cancer » Systemic therapy » Chemotherapy

Systemic therapy
Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
Types include chemotherapy, chemoradiation,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
Systemic therapy might be used alone or with
other therapies. Goals of systemic therapy
should be discussed before starting treatment.
Your wishes about treatment are important.
Make your wishes known.







Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking
or avoid certain herbal supplements
when on a systemic therapy. Some
supplements can affect the ability of a
drug to do its job. This is called a drug
interaction.

Systemic therapy or chemoradiation given
before surgery is called neoadjuvant
or preoperative therapy.
Systemic therapy given before and
after surgery is called perioperative
therapy.

It is critical to speak with your care
team about any supplements you may
be taking. Some examples include:

Systemic therapy or radiation therapy
given after surgery is called adjuvant or
postoperative therapy.
Systemic therapy given for advanced
disease may be called palliative
therapy.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. More than one
chemotherapy may be used to treat stomach
cancer. When only one drug is used, it’s
called a single agent. A combination or multiagent regimen is the use of two or more
chemotherapy drugs.

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy. Therefore, it is very
important to tell your care team about any
medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter
(OTC) drugs, herbals, or supplements you
are taking.

Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are
infused into a vein or injected under the skin
with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs may
be given as a pill that is swallowed.

Antibody drug conjugates
Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver
cell-specific chemotherapy. They attach to
a protein found on the outside of the cancer
cell, then enter the cell. Once inside the cell,
chemotherapy is released. An example is famtrastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu), which
attaches to HER2.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a type of systemic
treatment that tries to reactivate the immune
system against tumor cells. The immune
system has many on and off switches.
Tumors take advantage of "off switches."
Two leading off switches are PD-1 and
CTLA-4. Immunotherapy can be given alone
or with other types of treatment. Some
immunotherapy examples are nivolumab
(Opdivo), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), and
dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli).

Chemoradiation
Treatment that combines chemotherapy with
radiation therapy is called chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy may improve how well radiation
works, and that is why they are sometimes
used together. Chemoradiation may be used
to control symptoms caused by a tumor or to
shrink the tumor before surgery.

More information on checkpoint inhibitors and
immunotherapy side effects is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the

Treating stomach cancer » Radiation therapy » Clinical trials

Radiation therapy

EBRT

Radiation therapy (RT) or radiotherapy uses
high-energy radiation from x-rays, photons,
protons, electrons, and other sources to
kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. RT can
be given alone or with other treatments.
Treatment may focus on individual tumors, a
small area/region of the body, specific lymph
nodes, or areas where there may be small,
undetectable tumor deposits. RT is used to
treat the tumor in the target areas. However,
RT cannot be safely used to treat very large
areas and does not substitute for systemic
therapy that circulates everywhere in the body
in the blood.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s) or areas of the body.
Common types of EBRT that may be used to
treat your cancer include the following:




RT may be used as supportive care or
palliative care to help ease pain or discomfort
caused by cancer, or to control bleeding
caused by a tumor. RT can also be given
before or after surgery to treat or slow the
growth of cancer, especially if the surgical
margins have cancer cells.



Most types of radiation include short treatment
sessions that are given in small doses, once a
day over a few days to weeks. This keeps your
internal organs safe while still killing tumor
cells in the targeted area. For this reason, RT
can treat areas that may not be possible to
remove with surgery. Most of the time you will
not feel the radiation treatment each day, but
side effects might develop over the weeks of
treatment. Ask your care team which radiation
option(s) are best for you and what side effects
and long-term effects to expect.



A four-dimensional (4D) CT scan might be
used to plan RT. A 4D-CT records multiple
images over time. It allows playback of the
scan as a video, so that internal movement of
your organs can be tracked and accounted for
in targeting the RT.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Stomach Cancer, 2023

Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses
computer software and CT images to aim
beams that match the shape of the tumor
and limit radiation exposure to normal
body parts.
Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape of
the tumor and limit radiation exposure to
normal body parts.

Proton radiotherapy uses an atomic
particle beam that generates x-rays
inside your body to treat the tumor. In
some cases, this technology may be
recommended when it can be used to
reduce risks to internal organs.
Stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT)
uses precision, highly-focused radiation
beams to give high doses of radiation
often over 1 to 5 days to treat small,
well-defined areas of tumor. This is not
generally used to treat tumors in the
stomach itself since the high dose may
cause injury. However, SBRT may be
used for stomach cancer that has spread
to other areas of the body.

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating

cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a

Informed consent

Frequently asked questions

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Start the conversation

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
Rarely. It depends on the study, your health
insurance, and the state in which you live.
In general, procedures, drugs, or tests that
are considered standard of care will be billed
to you or your insurance, whereas those
considered research are covered by the trial
sponsor. Your treatment team and the research
team can help determine if you are responsible
for any costs.

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a
study for which you may be eligible, ask your
treatment team if you meet the requirements.
If you have already started standard treatment,
you may not be eligible for certain clinical
trials. Try not to be discouraged if you cannot
join. New clinical trials are always becoming
available.

Standard of care is the bestknown way to treat particular
disease based on past clinical
trials. There may be more
than one treatment regimen
that is considered standard of
care. Ask your care team what
treatment options are available
and if a clinical trail might be
right for you.

problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. When treatment
leads to remission (or no evidence of disease),
you will need follow-up or survivorship care for
late effects. During survivorship care you will
still have a care team, but it will look different.
Seek out peer support groups, whether online
or in person.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Side effects
Bleeding

Late effects

Bleeding is common in those with stomach
cancer. It may be caused by the tumor or a
result of treatment. An endoscopic treatment,
radiation therapy (if not done before), and an
angiography with embolization might be used
to treat (stop) bleeding.

Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They

loss, and other problems. Treatments for a
blocked stomach include a stent (enteral),
a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
(PEG) tube, a stomach-duodenum bypass
(gastrojejunostomy), systemic therapy, or
radiation therapy.

An angiography might be done when a blood
vessel has narrowed or suddenly becomes
blocked and does not allow blood to flow. In
an angiography, a catheter (thin plastic tube)
is inserted into an artery through a small
incision in the skin and guided to the area
with the use of x-rays. A contrast material is
injected through the tube and x-ray images
produce a picture of the blood vessel called an
angiogram.

A stent is a metal or plastic tube that expands.
It is placed in the stomach to keep your
stomach open so food can pass through.
A PEG tube is inserted through a cut in the
abdomen and placed in the stomach. Food is
given through this tube. A gastrojejunostomy is
a surgery to reroute the path food takes from
the stomach into the small intestine. The new
path from the stomach will avoid (bypass) the
blocked part of the duodenum. This surgery
may also be done as a preventive measure
if there is a high risk that your stomach may
become blocked.

Embolization is the process of blocking blood
flow through a blood vessel. This is performed
by placing various materials through the
angiography catheter while it is inside the
blood vessel. The material can be a coil, small
beads, or liquid medicine that causes the blood
to clot and blocks its flow.

Blocked esophagus
A tumor may block the esophagus, the
esophagogastric junction (EGJ), or the
stomach cardia. An esophageal stent is a tube
that widens the esophagus so food can pass
into the stomach.

Blood clots
Cancer or cancer treatment can cause blood
clots to form. This can block blood flow and
oxygen in the body. Blood clots can break
loose and travel to other parts of the body
causing stroke or other health issues. Venous
thromboembolism (VTE) refers to blood clots
in the veins.

Blocked stomach
A tumor may block food from passing
out of your stomach through the first part
of the small intestine (duodenum). This
blockage can cause pain, vomiting, weight

discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain.
Pain is common in those with a tumor causing
a blockage or for metastatic stomach cancer.
Severe abdominal pain can occur when the

tumor grows into nearby nerves or presses
against other organs. This pain is treated with
around-the-clock medicine such as morphine
or other opioids (narcotics). Sometimes, nonnarcotic medicines are used to treat pain.

Did you know?
The terms “chemotherapy” and
“systemic therapy” are often
used interchangeably, but they
are not the same. Systemic
therapy works throughout the
body and includes chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, immunotherapy,
endocrine therapy, and others.

Some people may benefit from palliative
radiation therapy, with or without systemic
therapy, to help relieve the pain. During this
treatment, a radiation beam is focused on the
tumor.

Locoregional disease » After surgery

After surgery
A sample of your tumor and lymph nodes
removed during surgery will be tested and
staged. Find out if you are having a D1 or
D2 lymph node dissection. Staging after
information gained during surgery is the
pathologic stage (p). Treatment is based on
the pTNM score and if you had chemotherapy
or chemoradiation before surgery.

Order of treatments
Most people with cancer will receive more
than one type of treatment. Below is an
overview of the order of treatments.

3 Preoperative or neoadjuvant

(before) therapy is given to shrink
the tumor before a primary treatment
such as surgery.

R0
In a clear or negative margin (R0), no
cancerous cells are found in the tissue around
the edge of the tumor (resection margins).
Cancer may be in regional lymph nodes.

3 Perioperative therapy is systemic

therapy, such as chemotherapy, given
before and after surgery.

If you received preoperative chemoradiation,
then you will enter surveillance and be
monitored for recurrence or progression. If you
received chemotherapy before surgery, then
you will have more chemotherapy.

3 Primary treatment is the main
treatment given to rid the body of
cancer.

3 Postoperative or adjuvant (after)

therapy is given after primary
treatment to rid the body of any cancer
cells left behind from surgery. It is also
used when the risk of cancer returning
(recurrence) is felt to be high.

If you had surgery only, then next steps are
based on how far the tumor has grown into
the wall of the stomach and if there was any
cancer in regional lymph nodes.






For a pT1 or pT2 tumor with no cancer
in lymph nodes (N0), you will enter
surveillance. This monitors for the return
of cancer.

3 First-line therapy is the first set of
systemic (drug) treatment given.

3 Second-line therapy is the next set

For some with a pT2 tumor and no
cancer in lymph nodes (N0) or tumors
with less than a D2 dissection, treatment
will be fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil
or capecitabine) before and after
fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation.

of treatment given if cancer progresses
during or after systemic therapy.

Talk to your care team about your treatment
plan and what it means for your stage and
type of cancer.

For those who have undergone a D2
lymph node dissection, treatment will
be chemotherapy. Preferred agents
are capecitabine with oxaliplatin or
fluorouracil with oxaliplatin.

In an R1 positive margin, the surgeon
removes all the visible tumor, but the
microscopic margins are still positive for
tumor cells. Despite best efforts this can
happen. Treatment is fluoropyrimidine-based
chemoradiation if you did not have it before.
You might have another surgery.

Not all tumors can be removed with surgery.
An unresectable tumor cannot be removed
completely with surgery. Unresectable cancer
might be treated first with chemoradiation or
systemic therapy. This is sometimes called
neoadjuvant or preoperative therapy. The goal
is to try to shrink the tumor to make it easier to

treatment plan that is best for you.

Best supportive care includes treatment
for bleeding, blockages, pain, nausea, and
vomiting. Best supportive care, supportive
care, and palliative care are often used
interchangeably.

Overview

Systemic therapy

When cancer returns near the stomach, it is
called locoregional recurrence. Surgery might
be an option for those with a locoregional
resectable tumor. Palliative care is also an
option. Stomach cancer that has spread to
distant sites in the body is called metastatic
disease. It might be referred to as stage 4
cancer. The goal of treatment is to reduce the
amount of cancer, called cancer burden, and
to prevent the further spread of cancer.

First-line therapies are given first. Options are
based on the systemic therapy you had before
and your PS. A biosimilar might be used in
place of trastuzumab. A biosimilar is almost
an identical drug made by another company.
It is used in the exact same way and at the
same dose as trastuzumab. Ask your care
team why one therapy might be chosen over
another. The reason might be related to tumor
mutations, cost, toxicity, or availability. Your
wishes are always important.

For unresectable locoregional recurrence or
metastatic disease, treatment will focus on
palliative care. Options are based on your
performance status (PS). PS is a person’s
general level of fitness and ability to perform
daily tasks.

bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

Long-term side effects

Dumping syndrome

Stomach cancer survivors are monitored for
long-term side effects. Side effects can be
managed. Talk to your health care provider
about how you are feeling.

Dumping syndrome occurs when food empties
into the small intestine too quickly. This may
happen within 30 minutes after eating a meal
(early dumping syndrome) or within 2 to 3
hours of eating (late dumping syndrome).

Blind loop syndrome

Symptoms of early dumping syndrome include
palpitations, diarrhea, nausea, and cramps.
Late dumping syndrome tends to cause
dizziness, hunger, cold sweats, and faintness.

Blind loop syndrome is a bacterial overgrowth
in the small intestine. After a total gastrectomy,
food doesn’t follow the normal digestion route
and bypasses a section of your intestine.
This can cause an infection. One of the
main symptoms of blind loop syndrome is
unexplained weight loss. To help prevent blind
loop syndrome, eat a diet high in protein and
low in carbohydrates.

To help manage the symptoms of dumping
syndrome:
Eat often throughout the day



Avoid drinking fluids with meals



Bone health
You will be screened regularly for low bone
density. You may receive medicine to manage
low bone density. In addition, your HCP may
consider vitamin D testing as needed. Talk to
your HCP before taking any over-the-counter
(OTC) supplements, vitamins, or medicines.

Eat a diet high in protein and fiber and low
in simple carbohydrates and sugars

Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Let your care
team know how you are feeling and if fatigue
is getting in the way of doing the things you
enjoy. Eating a balanced diet, exercise, yoga,
acupuncture, and massage therapy can
help. You might be referred to a nutritionist or
dietitian to help with fatigue.

Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how
to manage diarrhea and may recommend
medicines to stop the diarrhea. It is important
to drink lots of fluids. Changes to your diet
might help.

Indigestion

Low vitamin B12

Indigestion is a general term that describes
discomfort in your upper abdomen. Indigestion
is also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach.

Those who had a distal gastrectomy will be
monitored for low levels of vitamin B12 called
vitamin B12 deficiency. This vitamin is needed
to make red blood cells, which carry oxygen
to all parts of your body. A complete blood
count (CBC) and B12 levels should be done
every 3 months for up to 3 years, then every
6 months for up to 5 years, and once a year
after 5 years. You may be given vitamin B12
supplements, if needed.

To prevent indigestion:




Avoid foods that increase acid production
such as citrus juices, tomato sauces, and
spicy foods.
Avoid foods that lower gastroesophageal
sphincter tone such as caffeine,
peppermint, and chocolate.

Neuropathy

Low iron

Neuropathy is a nerve issue that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body.
It usually begins in the hands or feet and
gets worse over time. Neuropathy caused
by chemotherapy is called chemotherapyinduced neuropathy. You might be referred to
occupational, rehabilitation, and/or physical
therapy.

You will be monitored for low levels of iron
called iron deficiency. A CBC and iron levels
should be done at least once a year. You may
be given iron supplements, if needed. Certain
iron supplements will need to be avoided. Ask
your health care provider for more information.
Low iron levels can cause too few healthy red
blood cells in the body called anemia.

Weight loss

team. If you take the time to build a
relationship with your care team, it will help
you feel supported when considering options
and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects






Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, check out the websites listed in this
book.

Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life and length of life

Questions to ask

How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Possible questions to ask your care team are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your care
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Stomach Cancer, 2023

Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
