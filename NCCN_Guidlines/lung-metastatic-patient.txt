About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Version 7.2024 —
June 26, 2024.

If you’re reading this, you or

Lung cancer cells grow out of control. They
don’t die when they should and make many
new cancer cells, which become tumors.

someone you care about might
have non-small cell lung cancer

Lung cancer cells also don’t stay in place.
They can break away from a tumor, spread
outside the lung, and form more tumors.

(NSCLC). It’s the most common
type of lung cancer. In this
chapter, you’ll learn what this type

NSCLC is a type of lung carcinoma

of cancer is and what it means if

Almost all lung cancers are carcinomas (karsin-OH-mas). Lung carcinomas form from cells
that line the airways of the lungs. The airways
of the lungs are the bronchi, bronchioli, and
alveoli.

it’s metastatic.

What is NSCLC?

NSCLC is the most common lung
carcinoma. Other lung carcinomas are
neuroendocrine tumors. Information on lung
neuroendocrine tumors can be found at

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a type
of lung cancer. Another type of lung cancer
is small cell lung cancer, but it is a different
cancer covered in another book.

Airways of the lungs
The air you breathe moves through a
series of airways. It travels down your
throat and through your windpipe
(trachea). The windpipe splits into
two airways called bronchi. Inside
the lung, each bronchus divides into
smaller airways called the bronchioli.
At the end of the bronchioli are sacs
called alveoli. Oxygen is transferred
from air into the blood in the alveoli.

NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Cancers that have spread to the
lungs are not lung cancers. For
example, stomach cancer that
has spread to the lungs is still
stomach cancer.

There are several types of NSCLC

lung cancer are often written with Roman
numerals—stages I (1), II (2), III (3), and
IV (4). We will be listing stages as 1, 2, 3, and
4 to make the stages easier to read.

Each type of NSCLC forms from a particular
kind of cell. Below are common types of
NSCLC:






Stage 4 lung cancer is metastatic cancer
at diagnosis, but some earlier stages can
become metastatic cancer as well.

Adenocarcinoma (A-deh-noh-KAR-sihNOH-muh) often forms from cells that line
the alveoli and make mucus. This is the
most common type of NSCLC.

Cancer in stages 1, 2, and 3 has grown from
the airway into lung tissue. Some of these
early and locally advanced cancers spread far
after diagnosis. If this happens, the cancer’s
stage doesn’t change. Instead, these cancers
are referred to as metastatic lung cancer.

Large cell carcinoma forms from
any of the large cells that are found
throughout the airways.
Squamous cell carcinoma (squaymous) forms from cells that line the
bronchi.

This book focuses on metastatic NSCLC.
Information on early and locally advanced
NSCLC can be found at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

What’s metastatic NSCLC?
Metastatic NSCLC is lung cancer that has
spread to other organs. NSCLC can spread
the brain, liver, bone, and adrenal glands and
from one lung to the other lung. Metastatic
NSCLC also includes lung cancer that has
spread to the lining of the lungs.

Cancer stages and metastasis

cancer in the body. The main stages of

you. More information on supportive care is in
Chapter 2 and other chapters.

There’s no single treatment for NSCLC that’s
best for everyone. The best treatment is the
treatment that’s right for you. The following
chapters explain expert recommendations that
are based on the latest research and current
practices at leading cancer centers.

Clinical trials offer hope to all
people with lung cancer
Clinical trials are a type of health research that
tests new ways of fighting cancer. Ask your
care team if there is a clinical trial that is a
good fit for you. Learn more about clinical trials
in Chapter 5.

Systemic therapy is the most
common treatment
Systemic therapy is drug treatment for
lung cancer anywhere in the body. Medical
oncologists prescribe systemic therapy.

Advocate for yourself
You are an important member of your cancer
care team. Discuss the recommendations in
this book with your team. Together, you can
make a care plan that’s best for you.

Most people with metastatic lung cancer will be
on systemic therapy for the rest of their lives.
The type of systemic therapy you will receive
is partly based on features of the cancer. More
information is in Chapters 3, 4, and 5.

There is a list of suggested questions in
Chapter 6 to ask your team. You’re more likely
to get the care you want by asking questions
and making decisions with your team.

Local treatment is helpful at times
Local treatment may be used for a specific
area of metastatic cancer. It includes surgery,
radiation therapy, and chemoradiation.

Key points


Local treatment is commonly used to reduce
symptoms caused by metastasis. Less often,
it is used to try to cure limited metastases. An
example is cancer that has spread to only the
brain or an adrenal gland.

Supportive care addresses the
challenges of cancer

Supportive care has been shown to extend
and enhance life for people with lung cancer.
Tell your care team about your symptoms and
other needs to get the best supportive care for

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a
cancer of lung cells. Cancers that spread
to the lungs are not lung cancer.
Metastatic NSCLC is cancer that has
spread far from the lung in which it
started.
Treatment for metastatic lung cancer
varies among people based on what is
best for them. It often involves a wholebody drug treatment called systemic
therapy.

Care team

Health history

It takes a team to plan treatment of NSCLC.
Your team will use your test results to plan
treatment. You are an important part of the
team. Tell your team about your wishes for
treatment and any challenges you are facing.
Your input is just as important as tests for
treatment planning.

Expect your care team to review your health
in detail. This is known as taking a medical
history. Your team will want to know everything
possible about your past and current health.
You will likely be asked about:


Your team may consist of many members:








A pulmonologist, thoracic radiologist,
interventional radiologist, thoracic
surgeon, and pathologist to diagnose and
stage the cancer





A medical oncologist, radiation oncologist,
and thoracic surgical oncologist to treat
NSCLC



A palliative care provider, social worker,
mental health provider, and registered
dietitian to provide supportive services

Illnesses and injuries
Symptoms like unexplained weight loss,
trouble breathing, chest pain, and cough
Prescribed and over-the-counter
medicines and supplements
Previous surgeries
Lifestyle choices, including your diet, how
active you are, and whether you smoke or
drink alcohol

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families. Be prepared to discuss the health
problems of your close blood relatives. Such
family members include siblings, parents, and
grandparents related to you by birth and not by
adoption.

Many of these experts are supported by
nurses, technicians, or assistants who are
often on the frontline of cancer care.

Physical exam
Bring a list of your medications,
including herbals and
supplements, to appointments.

A team member will also perform a thorough
physical exam of your body. This exam may
include:


Checking your vital signs—blood
pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and
body temperature—and assessing your
overall appearance
Feeling and listening to organs, including
your spleen and liver

2 Tests for metastatic NSCLC » Blood test » Imaging





Imaging

Feeling for enlarged lymph nodes, which
are small disease-fighting structures
throughout your body

Imaging takes pictures of the inside of your
body. It is used to help stage the cancer by
showing cancer in lung tissue and if the cancer
has spread from the lung.

Assessing your level of pain, if any, when
you are touched

Based on your health history and exam,
your care team will rate your performance
status. Performance status is your ability to
do day-to-day activities. It is one of the most
important factors that your team will use to
plan treatment.

A radiologist is a doctor who’s an expert in
reading images like CT, MRI, or PET scans, or
x-rays. This doctor will convey the test results
to your care team.
Scans that were done more than 60 days ago
should not be used to decide your treatment.

Blood test

Diagnostic CT scan

Blood tests are commonly used to screen
for disease. They are also used to assess if
cancer is affecting organs.

A CT scan is a more detailed kind of x-ray. It
takes many pictures from different angles. A
computer combines the images to make 3D
pictures.

Samples of your blood will be removed with a
needle inserted into one of your veins. This is
called a blood draw.

A diagnostic CT shows body tissue more
clearly. It is often the first scan done to stage
lung cancer. Images of your chest and upper
abdomen including the adrenal glands are
needed.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures parts
of the blood including counts of white blood
cells, red blood cells, and platelets.

A higher dose of radiation is used for
diagnostic CT compared to regular CT. You'll
receive an injection of contrast if it's safe
for you. Contrast is a substance that makes
images clearer. Contrast travels through your
bloodstream, and you pee it out.

Chemistry profile
A chemistry profile assesses natural salts in
your body and how well your liver and kidneys
are working.

FDG-PET/CT scan
PET/CT is necessary if you haven’t had this
scan already. It may detect cancer that was not
found by CT alone.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, 2024

2 Tests for metastatic NSCLC » Biopsy of metastasis

Biopsy of metastasis

Your whole body will be scanned, or the scan
will extend from your neck to the middle of
your thighs.

A biopsy is a procedure that removes body
tissue or fluid for cancer testing. Often, tissue
from the organ with the metastasis is taken
rather than from the lungs. Your care team will
use imaging to select the biopsy site, which is
often the adrenal gland, liver, or bone.

The PET scan highlights tissue in your body
that may be cancerous. Before the scan, you
will be injected with a sugar radiotracer called
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The tracer will pass
out of your body in pee in about 2 days.

The type of biopsy that will be done depends
on the body part and the experience of your
care team. Common types of biopsies for
metastatic lung cancer are:

Cancer cells take in more of the tracer than
normal cells and show up as bright (or hot)
spots on the scan.
Multiple health problems can cause hot spots,
so the cause of hot spots often needs to be
confirmed by other testing.



Brain MRI
Lung cancer tends to spread to the brain.
MRI may show small brain tumors that aren’t
causing symptoms. If you have or may have
metastatic lung cancer, a brain MRI is very
important.



MRI uses a safe magnetic field and radio
waves to make pictures, so you don’t need
to worry about radiation. Contrast will also be
used unless it would not be safe for you. If you
can’t have an MRI, you may get a CT scan of
your head with contrast.



An external needle biopsy involves
guiding a thin needle through your skin
and into a tumor. These biopsies include
transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA),
core needle biopsies, pericardiocentesis,
and thoracentesis.
Down-the-throat biopsies involve
guiding a thin tube down your throat into
your airways (bronchus) or food pipe
(esophagus). These procedures include
many types of bronchoscopy.
Keyhole surgeries involve making
small openings in your chest. Small tools
are inserted through the holes to remove
tissue. Compared to open surgery, this
method is minimally invasive. These
surgeries include laparoscopy and
thoracoscopy. Thoracoscopy is also called
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
(VATS).

The removed tissue must be large
enough for testing
A doctor called a pathologist will assess the
tissue. Pathologists are experts in tissue and
cells and diagnosing cancer.

2 Tests for metastatic NSCLC » Biopsy of metastasis

very important for the treatment of metastatic
cancer:

The tissue must be large enough to run
several special lab tests. At some cancer
centers, the pathologist checks the tissue size
right after removal. This method is called rapid
on-site evaluation (ROSE). It helps to prevent
having the same procedure a second time.

A pathologist assesses for cancer
The pathologist will prepare the biopsy
tissue. This may take a couple of days. Then,
the pathologist will look at the tissue with a
microscope and classify the disease. This is
called histologic typing. If NSCLC is found, the
pathologist will identify the type, which is

Adenocarcinoma



Large cell lung carcinoma



Squamous cell carcinoma



Mixed and rare types

The results of lab tests used for diagnosis are
recorded in a pathology report. Ask your care
team for a copy of the pathology report and to
review the results with you. Always try to take
notes and ask questions.

Biopsy of metastasis
If your care team suspects metastatic
lung cancer, you may have a biopsy
of the metastasis instead of the lung
tumor. A biopsy of the metastasis can
diagnose and stage the cancer at the
same time. A needle biopsy through
the skin may reach some metastases,
such as in the liver (shown). Imaging is
often used to help guide the needle to
the correct spot.

2 Tests for metastatic NSCLC » Biomarker tests

Biomarker tests

All lung cancers should be tested for PD-L1. A
lab method called immunohistochemistry (IHC)
detects PD-L1.

Biomarker tests look for biological clues, or
markers, of cancer that differ between people.
Because of biomarkers, a treatment that helps
one person might not help you.

What if there’s not enough tissue
for biomarker testing?

Biomarker tests are performed on tumor tissue
removed with biopsy or during surgery, but
a blood sample may be tested as well. See
Guide 2 for a list of biomarkers and which
cancers should be tested for them.

If there’s not enough tissue, a second biopsy
may need to be scheduled. Sometimes a blood
sample can be drawn and the plasma in the
blood sample is tested for biomarkers.

What if the cancer has no
biomarkers?

Driver mutations cause normal cells to
become cancer cells and support cancer
growth. A driver mutation is found in at least 1
in 3 people with metastatic adenocarcinoma
but is much less common in squamous cell
lung cancer. It is very rare for cancers to have
more than one driver mutation.

Some lung cancers do not have a known
biomarker for which there is treatment.
Treatment options for these cancers are
based on the lung cell type, as discussed in
Chapter 5.

Molecular tests assess for mutations. Since
very few squamous cell carcinomas have a
driver mutation, molecular testing is decided
on a person-by-person basis.

“

NCCN experts strongly advise broad molecular
profiling of all mutations listed in Guide 2.
There are other known mutations linked with
lung cancer that may be tested, too. This
testing will help many people get the best
treatment for their cancer. Since many genes
are tested, it can take up to 3 weeks to get the
results.

DO NOT be afraid to ask your
medical team ANY questions at any
time!!! Your questions will help you
and them. No question is stupid.”

PD-L1 is a protein on the surface of cells.
PD-L1 on cancer cells stops white blood cells
called T cells from killing them. The cancer
cells then survive and make more cancer cells.

Pulmonary function tests

Supportive care addresses many needs other
than symptom relief. You can get help with
making treatment decisions and coordination
of care between health providers. You can get
emotional or spiritual support, financial aid, or
family counseling.

For some people, treatment of metastatic
NSCLC includes radiation therapy or surgery.
Treatment is based on how well the lungs
work.

A palliative care specialist may be a member
of your cancer care team. This specialist has
received specific training to provide additional
support to you. Some cancer centers have
palliative care programs.

Pulmonary function tests assess how well you
breathe:






Spirometry involves blowing into a tube to
measure how much air and how fast you
breathe.

Other specialists who may be involved in your
care include:

A gas diffusion test involves breathing in a
special, harmless gas and measuring how
much you breathe out. It tells how much
oxygen travels from your lungs into your
blood.
Body plethysmography involves sitting in
a small room and breathing into a tube.
This test measures how much air your
lungs can hold and how much air is left in
your lungs after you breathe out.

Social workers

The library of NCCN Guidelines for Patients
has books on supportive care. These books
focus on common physical and emotional
effects of many cancers and their treatment.

Supportive care

One of the NCCN books is about distress.
Everyone with cancer
feels distressed at some
point. It is normal to feel
worried, sad, helpless,
or angry. Distress can
become severe and
affect the way you live.

Supportive care is cancer care that improves
your quality of life. It is not just for people at
the end of life who need hospice. It has been
shown to extend and enhance life for people
with lung cancer.

Start supportive care early
Supportive care is sometimes called palliative
care since symptom relief is a main goal. You
may undergo procedures that help you breathe
and eat better and reduce coughing up blood.

A diagnostic CT scan can help show
where the cancer has spread. PET/CT
may detect cancer that CT did not. You
may get a brain MRI.
To help stage the cancer, a body part that
appears to have cancer and is far from
the lung tumor will likely be tested.
Biomarker tests look for small yet
important features of cancer that differ
between people. There are treatments for
some markers.
Supportive care aims to improve your
quality of life. It is important for everyone,
not just people at the end of life.

For some, driver mutations

Mutations aren’t just science fiction. All cancer
cells have mutations, but not all mutations
promote cancer. Mutations that support cancer
growth are called driver mutations.

Medicine that is targeted to
those mutations can help slow
the growth of cancer. Read this

At this time, we know of several driver
mutations in lung cancer. They can be
detected with molecular testing. Researchers
are looking for more driver mutations.

chapter to learn more.

Chemotherapy destroys fast-growing cells
even if they’re not cancer cells. It was once the
only treatment for metastatic lung cancer.

What are driver mutations?
A driver mutation is an abnormal gene that
supports the growth of cancer cells. It enables
cancer cells to quickly duplicate, survive, and
spread in the body.

Today, newer treatments target the effects of
driver mutations and harm fewer normal cells.

Driver mutation
The nucleus is the control
center or “brain” of cells.
Within the nucleus is genetic
information that tells the cells
what to do. The information
is stored in DNA, which looks
like a twisted ladder.
Genes are parts of DNA that
contain instructions for the
cell. Cancer cells often have
abnormal genes. A driver
mutation is an abnormal gene
that supports the growth of
cancer cells.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, 2024

3 Treatment of driver mutations » Targeted therapy

Targeted therapy

What if I already started
a treatment other than
targeted therapy?

Driver mutations create cell proteins that help
cancer cells grow. Targeted therapy works by
stopping these proteins.

Some cancers with known driver
mutations should first be treated with
other medicines that are described in
Chapter 5.

Kinase inhibitors
Kinases are a type of cell protein. They are
part of many chemical pathways, and some of
them start cell growth. Kinase inhibitors stop
the activity of kinases and, in turn, lower the
number of new cancer cells being made. They
are pills that can be taken at home.

When targeted therapy is recommended
as the first treatment, your options are:

Antibody therapy
Cells have receptors on their surface. Cell
receptors receive and send signals like
antennas. Antibodies can attach to receptors.
Some types of antibody therapy target
receptors on cancer cells, such as EGFR and
MET. The antibodies stop signals that tell the
cancer cells to grow.
VEGF antibodies stop the growth of blood
vessels on tumors. Without blood, cancer cells
die.

You may stop your current
treatment early and start targeted
therapy.

•

You may finish your current
treatment (including the last
phase called maintenance
therapy) and then start targeted
therapy.

New targeted therapy for lung
cancer

You will need to go to a health care center to
receive antibody therapy through a slow drip
(infusion) from a needle into a vein.

Other types of targeted therapy are being
studied in clinical trials. Clinical trials are a type
of medical research. Ask your treatment team
if there is an open clinical trial that’s a good fit
for you. More information on clinical trials is in
Chapter 5: Treatment by cell type.

Antibody-drug conjugate
An antibody-drug conjugate combines two
drugs in one medicine. One drug finds and
binds to certain cancer cells, and then the
other drug attacks the cancer. Antibody-drug
conjugates are given by infusion.

Some lung cancers have certain mutations in
the gene that makes EGFR. These mutations
cause the receptor to be overactive. EGFR
overactivity makes the cancer cells grow

3 Treatment of driver mutations » KRAS G12C mutation » ALK rearrangement

KRAS G12C mutation

ALK rearrangement

A signaling protein inside of lung cells called
KRAS can be overactive causing the cells to
quickly grow. A mutation in the KRAS G12C
gene causes this overactivity.

For some lung cancers, the ALK surface
receptor is overactive, causing tumor cells
to grow quickly. The overactivity is caused
when parts of two genes switch places, called
a gene rearrangement. Targeted therapy is
recommended for the first treatment.

Lung cancers with KRAS G12C mutation
are first treated based on PD-L1 level. For
treatment of lung cancer with PD-L1, see
Chapter 4: Treatment based on low and high
PD-L1. For treatment of PD-L1–negative
cancer, see Chapter 5: Treatment by cell type.

Starting ALK-targeted therapy
There are 5 ALK inhibitors used to treat lung
cancer. Preferred regimens include alectinib
(Alecensa), brigatinib (Alunbrig), and lorlatinib
(Lorbrena). Preferred regimens work better,
are safer, or cost less than other options or
there are better data supporting their use.
Other options are ceritinib (Zykadia) and

repotrectinib, or lorlatinib, for example.
Lorlatinib or repotrectinib may also be used to
treat more widespread lung cancer.

A cell surface receptor called ROS can be
overactive, causing lung cells to quickly
grow. The overactivity is caused by parts of
two genes switching places called a gene
rearrangement.

If targeted therapy is not likely to help, your
oncologist may recommend other treatments.
See Chapter 5 for options.

Entrectinib (Rozlytrek), crizotinib (Xalkori), or
repotrectinib (Augtyro) are preferred options.
Entrectinib or repotrectinib may work better
for treating and preventing the spread of lung
cancer in the brain. The other option is ceritinib
(Zykadia).

BRAF V600E mutation
BRAF, a signaling protein, can be overactive,
causing tumor cells to quickly grow. A BRAF
V600E mutation causes its overactivity.

In time, the cancer will grow despite ongoing
targeted therapy. If the cancer didn’t spread
to many more places, your oncologist may
recommend local treatment, such as surgery
or radiation therapy. You may also stay on your
current treatment if there is some benefit.

The preferred treatment is dabrafenib plus
trametinib or encorafenib and binimetinib.
Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and encorafenib (Braftovi)

MET exon 14 skipping

binimetinib (Mektovi) stop growth signals from
MEK.

Some lung cancers have too much of a cell
surface receptor called MET. Too much MET
causes fast cell growth. One of the causes of
excess MET is a deleted (skipped) part of the
MET gene called exon 14.

If dabrafenib plus trametinib makes you too
sick, you may receive dabrafenib alone or
vemurafenib (Zelboraf). Vemurafenib also
stops growth signals from BRAF.

The preferred treatment is MET inhibitors.
These treatments include capmatinib
(Tabrecta) and tepotinib (Tepmetko). Crizotinib
(Xalkori) is useful for some people. It inhibits
MET and other kinases. Sometimes, treatment
based on the cancer cell type is useful as the
first treatment (see Chapter 5).

Another option for initial treatment is systemic
therapy based on cancer cell type (see
Chapter 5).
In time, the cancer will worsen on targeted
therapy. After targeted therapy, treatment
based on cell type may be received. If not
used before, dabrafenib and trametinib or
encorafenib and binimetinib may be started
if the cancer grows with another type of
treatment.

In time, the cancer will worsen after targeted
therapy. Your next treatment may be based on
cell type. If not used before, a MET inhibitor
may be started if the cancer grows on other
types of treatment.

NTRK gene fusion

“

Lung cells have a family of 3 cell surface
receptors called TRK. NTRK genes contain
instructions for making TRK. Some lung
cancers have too much TRK, which causes
fast cell growth. The cause of excess TRK is a
joining (fusion) of NTRK with another gene.

The good news is that today the
medical industry has made great
advances in treating cancer.
They create a custom designed
treatment specifically for you.”

The preferred treatment is TRK inhibitors.
These treatments include larotrectinib
(Vitrakvi), entrectinib (Rozlytrek), and
repotrectinib (Augtyro). Sometimes, treatment
based on cancer cell type is useful as the first
treatment (see Chapter 5).
In time, the cancer will worsen on targeted
therapy. Your next treatment may be based on
cell type. If not used before, a TRK inhibitor

ERBB2 (HER2) mutation
Lung cancer cells have a receptor on their

gene that makes HER2 cause the receptor to
be overactive. HER2 overactivity makes the
cancer cells grow quickly.
Lung cancers with HER2 mutations are first
treated by cancer cell type. See Chapter 5 for
treatment options. If the cancer grows, you
may receive an antibody-drug conjugate.
Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu) is

Immune checkpoints
The immune system is the body’s natural
defense against disease. White blood cells
called T cells are a key part of this system. T
cells that kill cancer cells are called cytotoxic,
or killer, T cells.



The immune system has “brakes” that prevent
or slow down an immune response. These
brakes are called immune checkpoints. They
protect the body’s healthy cells. CTLA-4 and
PD-1 are two types of brake pedals on T cells.



In people with lung cancer, the brake pedals
on T cells may be overused. PD-1 is activated
when attached to PD-L1 on lung cancer cells.
CTLA-4 is activated when attached to B7 on
immune cells called dendritic cells. With the
brakes on, T cells are not able to kill cancer
cells.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, 2024

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), nivolumab
(Opdivo), and cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo)
are PD-1 inhibitors. They attach to PD-1
on T cells to block PD-L1 on cancer cells
from attaching.
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and durvalumab
(Imfinzi) are PD-L1 inhibitors. They attach
to PD-L1 on cancer cells so PD-L1 on T
cells can't attach.
Ipilimumab (Yervoy) and tremelimumabactl (Imjudo) are CTLA-4 inhibitors. They
attach to CTLA-4 on T cells and block
attachment to B7.

Checkpoint inhibitors are slowly injected into a
vein (infusion). It may take 30 or 60 minutes to
get the full dose. Infusions are received every
few weeks.
The number of weeks between treatments
depends on the inhibitor used. Often, people
get infusions for up to 2 years or until the
treatments stop working.

CTLA-4 from being activated.

NCCN.org/patients/response

There are many checkpoint inhibitor
regimens. The one chosen for treatment
is based on the level of PD-L1 and the
type of NSCLC.
If cancer growth slows down, you may
stay on some of them to increase the
time until the cancer grows again. This is
called maintenance therapy.

chapter to learn the best treatment
options based on cell type.

More information about palliative care is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Planning treatment
Many non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC)
don’t have a known biomarker that can be
used for treatment. Cancer care is based on
other factors when there’s no such biomarker.
One deciding factor is your ability to do day-today activities. This ability is called performance
status. Cancer and other diseases can limit
what you can do. If your ability is limited, some
cancer treatments may cause serious health
problems.

Types of systemic therapy
Your oncologist will prescribe a regimen for
you. A regimen consists of one or more drugs
that are taken at a specific dose, schedule,
and length of time.

The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) Performance Status is a common
scoring system. It consists of five scores
ranging from 0 to 4. The lower the score, the
better your ability to care for yourself.

Chemotherapy
The classic treatment of widespread metastatic
lung cancer is chemotherapy. It kills fastgrowing cells, including cancer.

A performance status of 0, 1, or 2
means that you are fairly healthy. NCCN
experts advise receiving systemic therapy.
Systemic therapy treats cancer anywhere it is
in the body. It can treat cancer in many places
as well as hard-to-reach places.

Chemotherapy for NSCLC is often a liquid that
is injected into a vein. Some injections are
done in the arm or hand, while others are done
through an implanted device called a port. An
infusion is a slow drip, controlled by a pump,
that may take hours.

A performance score of 3 or 4 suggests
that cancer treatment will be harmful. NCCN
experts advise receiving supportive care.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, 2024

Chemotherapy causes side effects because
it kills fast-growing normal cells as well as

Targeted therapy

cancer cells. Each chemotherapy has its own
set of side effects, so ask your care team
about what to expect.

Bevacizumab is a part of some regimens used
to treat lung cancer. It is a targeted therapy
called a VEGF antibody. It stops the growth
of blood vessels on tumors. Without blood,
cancer cells die.

Information on
common side effects
of chemotherapy can
be found at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Bevacizumab is given by infusion. The first
dose takes about 90 minutes to receive. Later
doses each take about 30 to 60 minutes.
Some of the common side effects of
bevacizumab are high blood pressure,
headache, changes in taste, dry or inflamed
skin, watery eyes, and back pain.
Less common, but severe problems that may
occur are tears in your digestive tract, wounds
that don’t heal, serious bleeding, and blood
clots in deep veins.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses
the immune system to kill cancer cells.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a type of
immunotherapy. They restore the ability of
immune T cells to kill lung cancer cells.
Checkpoint inhibitors are given by infusion. It
may take 30 or 60 minutes to get the full dose.
Immune checkpoint
inhibitors may cause
your immune cells to
attack your healthy
cells. Read about
the management of
immune-related side
effects at NCCN.org/

First-line therapy

Immune checkpoint inhibitors treat lung cancer
with PD-L1 as explained in Chapter 4. But they
also extend life when lung cancer does not
have PD-L1.

The first treatment given to you is referred
to as first-line therapy. Your oncologist will
choose a regimen for you based on:







Your health conditions and medications
Your performance status (0, 1, or 2 is
necessary for these treatments)



The cell type—adenocarcinoma, large cell
carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or
a rare type of NSCLC



Rare cell types of NSCLC are sometimes
described as not otherwise specified (NOS).

Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and durvalumab
(Imfinzi) are PD-L1 inhibitors.
Ipilimumab (Yervoy) and tremelimumabactl (Imjudo) are CTLA-4 inhibitors.

Your oncologist will prescribe immune
checkpoint inhibitors only if they are safe and
work for you. They may not be safe if you had
an organ transplant, have an autoimmune
disease, or you are taking medications that
suppress your immune system. They may
not work well if the cancer has EGFR or ALK
biomarkers.

Regimens with immune checkpoint
inhibitors
If your performance status is either 0 or 1,
immune checkpoint inhibitors may be part of
cancer treatment.

Types of non-small cell lung
cancer
There are 3 main types of non-small
cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma
is the most common type. It is a
cancer of mucus-making cells.
Large cell carcinoma starts in large
cells of the lung. Squamous cell
carcinoma starts in squamous
cells.

Systemic therapy is given in cycles of
treatment days, followed by rest days. One
cycle typically lasts for 3 to 4 weeks.
In general, systemic therapy is given for 4
cycles. If treatment isn’t making you too sick, a
total of 6 cycles may be completed.
After two cycles, your oncologist will assess
the results. The extent of the cancer can be
seen on CT scans. Contrast may be used. The
CT scan will be repeated after another 2 to 4
cycles.

Maintenance therapy

Another option is changing to a medicine that
you didn’t take as a first-line therapy. This
is called switch maintenance. Options for
maintenance therapy are listed in Guide 12.

If a line of treatment works, you may receive
maintenance therapy after the regimen is
finished. The goal of maintenance therapy is to
increase the time until the cancer grows.

You may stay on maintenance therapy for
2 years if your first-line therapy includes
immunotherapy. If immunotherapy is part
of second-line therapy, you’ll stay on
maintenance therapy until the cancer grows.

If results are good at the end of treatment, you
may stay on at least one of the medicines. This
is called continuation maintenance.

Second-line therapy



In time, lung cancer often starts to grow again
after first-line therapy. Care options are based
on performance status. This section describes
treatment when performance status is 0, 1,
or 2. NCCN experts recommend supportive
care when performance status is either 3 or 4.

Your oncologist will monitor treatment results.
You will get a CT scan every 6 to 12 weeks.
Contrast may be used.

Clinical trials

Second-line therapy is the second treatment
used for cancer care. If more lines of therapy
are needed, the options mentioned in this
section may be received. Options for secondline therapy are listed in Guide 13.




Single-agent chemotherapy (where you
would receive one chemotherapy drug) is
an option.

Despite advances in treatment, more research
is needed. Current treatment rarely cures
metasatic lung cancer or gives people a long
life. Improving treatment is made possible with
clinical trials.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are
preferred if not received before. If the
cancer grows while taking a checkpoint
inhibitor, switching to another checkpoint
inhibitor is not advised.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a

Other options include docetaxel with

Informed consent

Frequently asked questions

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside the clinical trial at any time.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Start the conversation

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or childcare due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

Don’t wait for your care team to bring up
clinical trials. Start the conversation and learn
about all of your treatment options. If you find
a study that you may be eligible for, ask your
treatment team if you meet the requirements.
If you have already started standard treatment,
you may not be eligible for certain clinical
trials. Try not to be discouraged if you cannot
join. New clinical trials are always becoming
available.
