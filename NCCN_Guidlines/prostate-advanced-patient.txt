About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Prostate Cancer, Version 4.2024 — May 17, 2024.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common
types of cancer. Cancer is what happens when
something goes wrong with the natural cell

of getting prostate cancer. This
chapter offers an overview of this
common cancer.

Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells.
Cancer cells develop genetic changes
(mutations) that allow them to multiply and
make many more cancer cells. The cancer
cells crowd out and overwhelm normal cells.
This can end up harming the body.

What is prostate cancer?
Prostate cancer is a disease where cells in the
prostate gland grow out of control.

Cancer cells can survive much longer than
normal cells do. They can replace many
normal cells and cause organs to stop working
well. Cancer cells can also spread outside the
prostate to other areas of the body.

The prostate is a gland located just below
the bladder in the pelvis, deep inside the
area of your body between your hip bones.

What are the symptoms of
prostate cancer?





A symptom is a feeling or problem that can
indicate a disease or condition. Prostate
cancer often grows slowly and shows no
symptoms for a long time. You don’t have to
have symptoms to have prostate cancer.



Blood in the urine or semen



Burning or pain while urinating



Unexplained weight loss



Bone, hip, or back pain

Dull pain in your groin or pelvis
Erectile dysfunction (difficulty getting an
erection) or painful ejaculation

What causes prostate
cancer?

Symptoms, if they occur, may include:


Feeling like your bladder hasn’t fully
emptied

Many people who develop prostate cancer
wonder where it came from and how they got
it. Cancer researchers don’t know exactly what
causes prostate cells to grow out of control
(become cancerous). The fact is, everyone
with a prostate has a risk of getting prostate
cancer.

It’s important to know that prostate cancer has
many of the same symptoms as a condition
called enlarged prostate (also called benign
prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH). An enlarged
prostate can push against the bladder and
compress the urethra, which slows the flow of
urine and can cause a feeling that you haven’t
fully emptied your bladder.

But several factors are linked to a higher risk of
prostate cancer. These are called risk factors.
A risk factor is anything that increases your
chance of getting cancer. Risk factors don’t
necessarily cause prostate cancer, but people
with prostate cancer usually have one or more
of these risk factors:

BPH is much more common than prostate
cancer. It’s difficult to tell the difference
between the two conditions based on
symptoms alone. Be sure to tell your health
care providers if you have any of these
symptoms, because you may need special
testing:

Age
The biggest risk factor for prostate cancer
is age. Prostate cancer is diagnosed most
often in those aged 65 years and above. Your
chances of getting prostate cancer increase as
you become older.



Urinating frequently, especially at night



Weak or intermittent urine stream

Family history



Trouble urinating or straining to urinate



Trouble holding in urine

Your family health history is information about
the diseases and health conditions in your
family. A family history reflects a pattern of
certain diseases among family members.

Where does the prostate fit in?
The prostate is a gland located in the pelvis—the area between your hips. The
prostate is important for sexual reproduction.
Prostate: A gland in the male reproductive system. A gland is an organ that makes
fluids or chemicals the body needs. The prostate gland makes a fluid that nourishes
and helps transmit sperm. The prostate also contains muscles that help propel
semen through the urethra during ejaculation.
Semen: A fluid made up of liquids from the prostate and the seminal vesicles as
well as sperm from the testicles. During ejaculation, semen is released from the body
through the urethra and out through the penis.
Urethra: A tube that carries urine from the bladder and out of the body. The prostate
surrounds the urethra just beneath the bladder.
Seminal vesicles: Two glands that make and store another part of the fluid that
becomes semen. The seminal vesicles are located above the prostate and behind
the bladder.
Bladder: An organ that holds urine.

Having a close family member with prostate
cancer (a sibling or parent) increases the
chance of getting it yourself. Those with a
family history of certain other cancers (breast,
ovarian, colon, pancreatic, and other cancers)
may also be at higher risk for prostate cancer.

What does aggressive mean?
When health care professionals describe
cancer as aggressive, they mean the
cancer is likely to grow or spread more
rapidly than average.

Genetic factors
When cancer “runs in the family,” genetic
testing can be done to find specific genetic
changes (mutations) known to be linked
with prostate cancer and other cancers. For
instance, having an inherited genetic change in
the BRCA2 gene increases the risk of getting
prostate cancer.

Aggressive can also be used to describe
therapy that may be stronger or more
intense than other treatment options.

There are also genetic abnormalities that don’t
run in families and aren’t inherited.
Black males may want to talk with their health
care providers about getting screening tests
earlier and perhaps more often than what’s
recommended for other males.

Race
In the United States, Black males are more
likely than white males to develop prostate
cancer. Prostate cancer in Black males is also
more likely to occur at an earlier age and be
more aggressive and more advanced when
diagnosed. Black males are also twice as likely
to die from prostate cancer compared to white
males.

Diet and lifestyle
No one particular diet has been found to cause
prostate cancer or to prevent it. However,
eating food that’s high in fat, such as meat
and dairy products, has been linked with an
increased risk of prostate cancer. Smoking and
obesity also increase the risks of developing
and dying from prostate cancer.

Hispanic and Asian males are less likely than
both white and Black males to be diagnosed
with prostate cancer.

On the other hand, those who eat more fruits
and vegetables have a lower risk of developing
advanced prostate cancer. Exercise and
maintaining a healthy weight may also
decrease the aggressiveness of prostate
cancer and the likelihood of dying from it.

Several things contribute to these differences,
such as barriers to accessing health care
(including early detection screening), as well
as biological and genetic factors, and other
causes. Researchers are trying to understand
the reasons for these differences and what can
be done to improve outcomes.

Early vs. advanced prostate cancer
Early-stage prostate cancer has not visibly spread beyond the prostate. It
usually grows slowly and stays in the prostate. This is also called localized prostate
cancer.

Advanced-stage prostate cancer has grown outside the prostate and spread to
other areas in the body such as distant lymph nodes (bottom left), bones, or organs
like the liver or lungs (bottom right). This is also called metastatic prostate cancer.

What is advanced-stage
prostate cancer?



Prostate cancer can be grouped into earlystage cancer or advanced-stage cancer.

How does prostate cancer spread? Cancer
cells use the bloodstream like a highway to
travel to distant areas in the body. Cancer cells
can also spread through the lymphatic system.
The lymphatic system is a network of organs
and vessels that fights infections and circulates
a clear fluid called lymph throughout the body.

Early stage
Early-stage prostate cancer has not spread
beyond the prostate. The cancer usually grows
slowly and stays in the prostate. Cancer that is
contained entirely within the prostate is called
localized prostate cancer.

A normal and important part of the lymphatic
system are the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are
small, disease-fighting clusters that filter lymph
fluid to remove germs. Lymph vessels and
nodes are found everywhere in the body.

More information about early-stage prostate
cancer can be found in the NCCN Guideline
for Patients: Early-Stage
Prostate Cancer at NCCN.
org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for
Cancer app.

Some patients have advanced-stage prostate
cancer when they’re first diagnosed. Others
develop advanced-stage cancer after having
treatment for early-stage cancer.

Advanced stage
Advanced stage means that the cancer has
spread beyond the prostate to other areas in
the body. This spreading is called metastasis
or metastatic cancer. Metastatic prostate
cancer may spread to the lymph nodes, bones,
liver, lungs, and other organs.

Can prostate cancer be
cured?
Advanced-stage prostate cancer is usually
a life-long disease. But treatment can slow
down its growth, reduce symptoms, and
prolong life. Treatments for advancedstage prostate cancer include hormone
therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy,
immunotherapy, targeted therapy,
radiopharmaceuticals, surgery, and other
therapies.

This book is all about advanced-stage prostate
cancer.


Cancer that grows from the prostate
gland to nearby areas such as lymph
nodes, but no farther, is called regional
prostate cancer. (It’s also called locally
advanced prostate cancer. This book will
call it regional prostate cancer to avoid
confusion between localized and locally
advanced.)

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Advanced-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

Cancer that spreads beyond the prostate
to other parts of the body is called distant
metastatic prostate cancer or simply
metastatic prostate cancer.

It’s true that prostate cancer in the advanced
stage can be fatal for some patients. But in the
past few years, improved detection methods

and better treatments have been reducing
the number of deaths from prostate cancer
in patients of all races and ethnicities. Many
people with advanced-stage prostate cancer
continue to live with the cancer and, in the end,
may die from something else.

Many new tests and treatments
are now available for advanced
prostate cancer. If possible,
seek care or a second opinion
from a medical center that
specializes in prostate cancer.

Scientists have learned a great deal about
prostate cancer in recent years. As a result,
today’s detection methods and treatments
work better than those in the past. Also, many
patients with prostate cancer have more
treatment choices now than they had before.

What’s the best treatment?

Key points

The best treatment for prostate cancer is
the treatment that’s right for you. Your team
will work with you to figure out the therapies
that have the best chance for fighting your
particular cancer.



Importantly, your team should follow best
practices. This book is based on the best
practices for treating advanced-stage prostate
cancer. Best practices come from the latest
research and methods at top cancer centers.
Your treatment team should personalize your

Prostate cancer develops when cells in
the prostate gland grow out of control.
Age is the leading risk factor for prostate
cancer. As you age, your chances of
developing prostate cancer increase.
Having a close family member with
prostate cancer means that you have a
higher chance of getting it yourself.
Everyone with a prostate is at risk for
prostate cancer. Black people and people
with certain inherited genetic mutations
are at greater risk.
Advanced-stage prostate cancer has
spread outside the prostate to other areas
in the body. This spreading is called
metastasis.
Advanced-stage prostate cancer is
usually a life-long disease. Treatment can
slow it down, reduce its symptoms, and
help people live longer.

the best plan to treat your prostate
cancer.

Health care providers use a variety of tests
to find prostate cancer and to determine how
advanced the cancer is. Tests are used to
plan treatment, check how well treatment
is working, and monitor your health after
treatment ends. This chapter describes what
tests you might have and what to expect
during testing. Not every person with prostate
cancer will receive every test listed here.

However, age and other factors—such as an
enlarged prostate or a urinary tract infection—
can also cause high levels of PSA. This
means that a PSA test by itself can’t provide a
diagnosis of prostate cancer. That’s why a PSA
test is often paired with imaging or a digital
rectal exam, or both, to decide whether you
need a biopsy.

When you go for testing, bring someone with
you to listen, ask questions, and write down
the answers.

PSA level (also called total PSA) is measured
in nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of
blood.

Common prostate tests

Digital rectal exam

Common prostate cancer tests are used to
detect the possibility of prostate cancer in
someone who’s undiagnosed. They’re also
used to check and monitor prostate cancer in
patients who have been diagnosed.

A digital rectal exam (also called a prostate
exam) may be an awkward and unpleasant
form of testing. But it’s the simplest and most
direct way to check the size and texture of your
prostate.

Two common tests that look for prostate cancer
are the PSA test and digital rectal exam.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Advanced-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

For this test, the doctor will insert a gloved
finger into your rectum to feel your prostate for
any signs of cancer. An irregular or hardened
part of the prostate could be a sign of a tumor.

may feel for enlarged glands (lymph nodes) in
your groin, underarms, and neck.

Family history
Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your care team will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history.

General health history
Health history and physical exam

It’s important to ask members from both
sides of the family about all cancers, not just
prostate cancer. Ask family members if any
relatives had cancer, at what age they were
diagnosed, and if they died from it. Also ask
family members about other health issues like
heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Share this
information with your care team and update
your team with any changes to your family
history.

Your care team needs to have all your health
information. They’ll ask you about any health
problems and treatments you’ve had in your
life. Be prepared to talk about any illness or
injury you’ve had and when it happened. Also
tell your team about any symptoms you have.
Bring a list of your regular medications and
any over-the-counter medicines, herbs, or
supplements you take. Some of these (such
as saw palmetto or St. John’s wort) can cause
changes in your PSA level, so your care team
needs to know if you’re taking them.

Symptoms and quality of life
Your doctor or another member of your care
team will ask you a series of questions about
what symptoms you may have (such as peeing

Taking supplements?
Bring a list of your medicines to your
doctor’s office when you begin testing. It’s
also important to tell your treatment team if
you’re using any complementary medicines,
especially supplements, vitamins, or herbs.
Some of these can interfere with your cancer
tests or treatment. This may reduce the
effectiveness of treatment or cause more
side effects.

frequently, difficulty peeing or pooping, or
sexual problems). You’ll also be asked how
these symptoms affect your quality of life.

Diagnosis vs. prognosis
What’s the difference between your
diagnosis and your prognosis? These
two words sound alike but they’re very
different.

Quality of life refers to your overall satisfaction
with your well-being and your ability to
participate in regular activities. It’s important
to answer all these questions honestly and
completely so your care team has full and upto-date information about how you’re doing.

Diagnosis is identifying an illness
based on tests. Your diagnosis names
what illness you have.

Diagnostic tests

Prognosis is the likely course and
outcome of a disease. Your prognosis
predicts how your illness will turn out.

Diagnostic tests are used to confirm you have
cancer. They’re also used to find out if the
cancer is localized or advanced. Diagnostic
tests can help plan treatment after you’ve been
diagnosed and can detect whether the cancer
is still growing or spreading after treatment.

Imaging can come before, during, or after a
biopsy. Imaging may also be used after cancer
treatment to see how well it worked and to
check if the cancer comes back.

Diagnostic tests include imaging scans,
biopsies, and genetic tests.

Imaging tests

Imaging methods for prostate cancer include
MRI, CT, PET, ultrasound, bone scan, or a
combination of these.

An imaging test takes pictures (images) of the
insides of your body. The images can reveal
cancer, including its size, location, and other
features such as the size of the prostate itself.
The images may show where the cancer
started (primary tumor) and whether the
cancer has spread (metastasized).

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. An MRI
can be used to get a more detailed view of the
cancer within the prostate. It’s also used to see
if cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or
to the bones in your pelvis.

After your scan, your images will be studied by
a radiologist. A radiologist is a doctor who’s an
expert in reading imaging tests. The radiologist
will send the results to your care team. This
information helps to plan the next steps of your
care. Your team will discuss the results with
you. Be sure to ask any questions you may
have.

check whether the cancer has come back
(recurrence).
An appointment for an MRI scan can take
1 to 2 hours, including 30 to 60 minutes of
actual scanning time. You’ll need to remain as
motionless as possible during each scan. You
may be positioned with pillows or bolsters to
help you keep still.

A PET scan requires injecting a radioactive
substance called a tracer into your
bloodstream. It takes about an hour for the
tracer to circulate throughout your body. The
tracer targets your cancer cells, which show
up as bright spots on the scan. Afterward, the
radiotracer is passed out of your body in your
urine.

Because an MRI uses magnets, you can’t
bring any metal objects (such as jewelry,
phones, wristwatches, or belts with metal
buckles) into the imaging room.
CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. CT takes
many x-rays of the same body part from
different angles. The computer combines all
the x-ray pictures to make a single detailed
image. A CT scan is usually completed in less
than 30 minutes.

A PET scan appointment can take 1 to 2
hours, including about 30 minutes of actual
scanning time.
Because PET uses a different imaging method,
it’s often combined with other types of imaging,
such as CT or MRI, to provide an even more

detailed image. This combined method is
called a PET/CT or PET/MRI scan.

A bone scan uses a radioactive tracer to make
pictures of the inside of bones. Before the
pictures are taken, the tracer is injected into
your bloodstream. It can take a few hours for
the tracer to enter your bones.

PSMA-PET
PET scans use different types of tracers. The
most common tracer in prostate cancer locates
a protein called prostate-specific membrane
antigen (PSMA) on the surface of prostate
cancer cells. Prostate cancer cells can make a
lot of PSMA, so doctors developed tracers that
target this specific protein.

A special camera will take pictures of the
tracer in your bones. Areas of bone damage
absorb more tracer than healthy bone. These
areas show up as bright spots in the scans.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound imaging is commonly used to help
guide a biopsy of the prostate. This is called
transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging.

Not everyone with prostate cancer will need a
PSMA-PET scan. It’s mostly used to monitor
prostate cancer for recurrence. It’s also used to
determine whether targeted therapy can treat
certain cases of metastatic prostate cancer.

During a biopsy, an ultrasound probe is
inserted into the rectum. The probe is about
the size of a finger. The device uses highenergy sound waves to create a view of the
prostate from inside the body. These images
allow the surgeon to remove a small sample
of the prostate without having to open up your
abdomen.

Bone scan
A bone scan can detect whether cancer has
spread to your bones. A bone scan may be
used if you have bone pain, have a high risk
for bone metastasis, or have changes in
certain test results. Bone scans may also be
used to monitor treatment.

that has spread outside of the prostate), or
sometimes both.

A biopsy is a procedure in which a sample of
cells, fluid, or tissue is removed from your body
and tested for cancer. It’s the main way to
confirm whether you have cancer.

Biopsy of the prostate
A prostate biopsy is usually performed by
a urologist. A urologist is a doctor who’s an

take 12 or more core samples from different
parts of the prostate. Checking different areas
provides a more complete evaluation of cancer
throughout the gland.

For this procedure, you’ll lie on your side
with your knees curled up or you’ll lie on your
back with your legs raised. You’ll be given
anesthesia to numb the pain or to make you
fall asleep. The urologist will insert a lubricated
probe into your rectum. The probe provides a
visual image of the prostate.

After the biopsy samples are removed, a
specialist called a pathologist will examine the
samples under a microscope and test them for
cancer cells. The pathologist will find out how
many of the core samples contain cancer and
will also measure the percentage of cancer in
each core.

The urologist will then insert a hollow needle
into the prostate gland using the video display
to guide it. The needle is inserted either
through the perineum (the skin between the
anus and scrotum) or through the rectum.

With this information, the pathologist can
estimate the amount of cancer in the prostate
and how aggressive it may be. Also, by
knowing where each core sample was
taken, the pathologist can tell if the cancer
is concentrated in a certain section of the
prostate.

When the urologist removes the needle, it
will pull out a small sample of prostate tissue
called a core. A core sample is only about 1
to 2 millimeters wide and 12 to 20 millimeters
long—about as wide as a toothpick and as
long as a raisin. The urologist will usually

The pathologist will put these results into a
report. Ask your doctor or another member of

Biopsy of the prostate
A biopsy removes a sample of
tissue that is tested for cancer.
This is a transperineal biopsy, in
which a needle is inserted through
the perineum and into the prostate.
An ultrasound probe, which goes
into the rectum, helps the doctor
guide the needle into the prostate.
MRI scans of your prostate may
be combined with the ultrasound
image to provide a highly accurate
picture of the cancer.

your care team to review the pathology report
with you.

A genetic test is used to find harmful changes
in your genes. Genes are small segments
of DNA inside every cell. Genes provide
the instructions to tell the cell how to make
proteins, which carry out a lot of important
functions in the body.

Biopsy of the metastasis
A biopsy of a metastasis can be taken from
a lymph node, an internal organ, or a bone.
This biopsy is performed in a similar way to
a prostate biopsy—using a hollow needle to
remove cores of tissue.

Once in a while, a gene will have or develop
a change, called a mutation, that damages
its function. As a result of this mutation, the
gene isn’t able to make a normal protein so
the protein can’t do its necessary job. This can
affect the usual activities of the cell, which can
lead to disease, such as cancer.

Sometimes, a blood sample is taken, also
called a “liquid biopsy,” to look for cancer cells
in the blood.
Having a biopsy may cause complications. A
complication is an unwanted and unplanned
result from a procedure. Complications may
include infection, bleeding from the rectum,
or blood in the urine, stool, or semen. These
usually go away after a few days or, with
semen, after a few weeks. It’s also important
to know that a biopsy won’t cause prostate
cancer to spread or worsen.

Mutations can be passed down in families,
in which case they occur in every cell in your
body. Or mutations can occur spontaneously
in just some of your cells. In other words, they
may be in your body before you’re born (called
a hereditary or germline mutation) or occur by

Biopsy of the metastasis
Prostate cancer may
metastasize to lymph nodes,
bones, or internal organs. A
biopsy of a metastasis (as seen
here, taken from the liver) uses
a hollow needle to remove a
small core of tissue. The tissue
is tested in a lab to look for
cancer cells.

and other cancers in addition to prostate
cancer.

The two basic types of genetic tests used
for prostate cancer care are hereditary gene
testing and tumor testing:

If an inherited cancer risk gene is suspected
based on your family’s or your own health
history, you should ask about genetic testing.
Your health care provider can talk to you about
testing or refer you to a genetic counselor.
A genetic counselor is an expert who has
special training in genetic diseases. A genetic
counselor can help you decide whether you
would like to undergo germline testing and also
help you interpret the results of these tests.

Hereditary gene testing
Sometimes, mutations in genes inherited from
your parents can increase the risk of different
cancers. You can pass these genes on to your
children. Your siblings or other family members
might also carry these mutations. If you have
a family history of cancer, your health care
provider might suggest genetic testing to find
out if you have an inherited cancer risk. This is
also called germline testing.

Inherited gene testing is recommended if you
have prostate cancer and any of the following:


The goal of this type of genetic testing is to
look for inherited (germline) mutations that
occur in every cell in your body. Genetic
germline testing is done using a sample of
your blood, urine, or saliva.



For prostate cancer, this testing typically looks
for characteristic changes in these genes:
BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2,
MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, and others.





Having a hereditary mutation doesn’t mean
you’ll automatically get cancer. It means your
chances for developing certain cancers is
higher.

Talk to your medical providers and/or a genetic
counselor about your family history of cancer.

Tumor testing

Some mutations can put you at risk for more
than one type of cancer. Inherited mutations in
genes like BRCA1 or BRCA2 are also related
to breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic
cancer, and skin cancer (melanoma). Inherited
mutations in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2
are related to colorectal cancer, uterine cancer,

Tumor testing (also called somatic testing,
molecular tumor testing, or tumor profiling)
requires a tissue sample from the tumor itself
or from a metastasis in a lymph node, bone,
liver, lung, or other affected area. Or it may
come a sample of your blood, which contains
the tumor’s DNA.

In this type of testing, the sample is analyzed
to look at its molecular components. Tumors
often release molecules that can be used as
clues for finding and learning about the cancer.
This information helps figure out the likelihood
that your cancer could spread to other parts of
the body. It can also help predict whether the
cancer could transform into a more aggressive
type.

In this system, the letters T, N, and M stand for
different areas of cancer growth:






Importantly, targeted therapies (PARP
inhibitors, for example) can be used against
cancers that have particular molecular tumor
markers. So the testing looks for specific
abnormalities in a number of genes involved in
DNA repair, including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM,
PALB2, FANCA, and others.

T (tumor) – Describes the size of the
main (primary) tumor and if it has grown
outside the prostate
N (node) – Identifies whether cancer has
spread to lymph nodes
M (metastasis) – Indicates if cancer
has spread (metastasized) to parts of the
body outside of the pelvis

Your provider will assign a number to each
letter, based on your test results. The higher
the number, the larger the tumor (T) or the
more the cancer has spread (M). These scores
are combined to assign a “stage” to the cancer.

Tumor staging

Staging is a way to describe how much cancer
is in your body and how far it has spread.
Knowing your stage is important for predicting
the course of your disease and for making a
treatment plan.

Tumors come in different shapes and sizes. So
it’s not easy to compare one tumor to another.
To solve this problem, cancer experts created
the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system to
describe any tumor. It’s based on the results of
your imaging scans, biopsies, and blood tests.

Cancer staging is done when you’re first
diagnosed. It may also be done after treatment
to confirm that the stage hasn’t changed.

How to read a TNM score
Let’s say your prostate cancer is given a TNM score of T4, N1, M1. This score means that
the tumor has grown outside the prostate gland (T4) and has spread to nearby lymph nodes
(N1) and to one or more distant parts of the body (M1).
Why know your TNM score? For one, it lets you know the extent of your cancer. It also helps
characterize your risk for the cancer to spread. Your level of risk helps indicate the most
appropriate treatment for you.

Tests are used to plan treatment and
check how well treatment is working.
An unusually high amount of PSA in the
bloodstream may be a sign of prostate
cancer.
Imaging tests are used to see where the
cancer has spread beyond the prostate.
Imaging also shows the size and location

reduction of testosterone. Castration can be
done with hormone-lowering medication or
by surgical removal of one or both testicles
(orchiectomy). Though orchiectomy is a

with your care team about which
treatment could be best for you.

Prostate cancer is a complex disease with
many treatment options. Treatments for
advanced-stage prostate cancer include
hormone therapy as well as non-hormone
therapies like chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
targeted therapy, and radiation therapy. Often,
hormone therapy is combined with one or more
other therapies. Combining therapies can be
more effective than using either therapy alone.

Hormone therapy is a systemic (whole-body)
treatment that adds, blocks, or removes
hormones. A hormone is a natural chemical
made by a gland in the body. Its job is to
activate cells or organs.
Male hormones are called androgens. The
main androgen is testosterone. Most of the
testosterone in the body is made by the testicles.
Testosterone helps produce sperm, among
other functions. But testosterone also helps
prostate cancer grow. A type of hormone therapy

worse. In Black patients, hormone therapy may
increase the risk of death from heart issues.

Side effects of hormone therapy

LHRH agonists can cause a surge in
testosterone for a few weeks before dropping
to an undetectable level. This increase is
called a testosterone flare. A testosterone flare
can cause bone pain and urinary problems.
But these symptoms will go away after the
first few weeks of treatment. You might be
given an anti-androgen medicine to prevent
testosterone flare.

Ask your doctor about monitoring your blood
pressure and cholesterol levels. Also, let your
primary care physician know you’re being
treated with ADT.

Hormone therapy can have significant side
effects. These vary from person to person
and from one type of hormone therapy to
another. Many other factors affect your risk for
side effects including your age, your health
before treatment, how long or often you have
treatment, and other things.
The good news is that your treatment team
can offer supportive care to lessen or reverse
many of these effects.

The sexual side effects of hormone therapy
can be a significant cause of stress. Hormone
therapy may reduce your desire for sex and
cause erectile dysfunction.

In general, the longer you’re on hormone
therapy, the greater your risk for side effects.
These can include tiredness (fatigue), hot
flashes, mood changes, weight gain, changes
in penis length and testicle size, tenderness
and growth of your breasts, and loss of muscle
mass.

Erectile dysfunction means having difficulty or
being unable to have an erection of the penis.
Erectile dysfunction medicines (such as Viagra
and Cialis) aren’t as effective for those on
hormone therapy. These drugs don’t restore
the loss of sexual desire caused by lower
androgen levels.

Thinning and weakening of your bones
(osteoporosis) and bone fractures can also
happen. When you start ADT, you may have a
test to measure your bone density. If your bone
density is low, your care team can recommend
medications you can take to strengthen your
bones.

However, some treatments that may improve
erectile function include injections of
medication into the penis, vacuum constriction
devices (“penis pump”), or surgical implants
that produce an erection.
Your sex drive and your ability to have an
erection may gradually return after stopping
hormone therapy, though the process may
take up to a year or more. Some patients
never regain full ability to have an erection.

Hormone therapy also increases the risk
for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. If
you already have either of these conditions,
hormone therapy can cause them to get

 TIP
Regular exercise can lessen the
symptoms and side effects of
hormone therapy, including:

Talk to your care team about how to manage
the side effects of hormone therapy. They
have ways to lessen or soothe most of these
problems. Bones can be strengthened with
medicine as well as with physical activity.
Exercise and eating a healthy diet can also

Physical activity can also improve your
general health and make you feel better.

Loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and
other sexual side effects usually go away after
you stop hormone therapy. In the meantime,
consider talking to your partner and/or a
therapist to help you deal with any problems
you’re having.

Hormone therapy resistance

It’s important to know that prostate cancer
that’s resistant to hormone therapy is still
treatable. So most people with hormoneresistant prostate cancer stay on ADT to keep
their testosterone at a low level.

Hormone therapy can be very effective
at shrinking or slowing the growth of your
prostate cancer. But for people with metastatic
prostate cancer, hormone therapy can lose this
effect over time, even when their testosterone
is at a very low level.

Other hormone-reducing drugs are also still
used. These hormone therapies are often
combined with non-hormone treatments
like chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or
immunotherapy to help get better results.

Why? Because the cancer eventually
learns how to survive without using much
testosterone, which makes it unaffected by
hormone therapy. The cancer can “resist” the
hormone therapy. This is called hormoneresistant prostate cancer (also called
castration-resistant prostate cancer).

live longer as well as reduce their pain and
other symptoms. Docetaxel is an option for
some who are taking ADT for the first time.
Docetaxel is also used to treat metastases
after ADT fails to stop cancer growth.

Hormone therapy may be the first treatment
recommended for advanced prostate cancer,
but it’s not the only one. Other systemic
treatments that don’t use hormones can also
slow cancer growth, prevent cancer symptoms,
and prolong life.

Cabazitaxel
Cabazitaxel (Jevtana) is a chemotherapy
option if docetaxel isn’t effective. Cabazitaxel
can’t cure prostate cancer but it can help
people live longer and improve pain and other
symptoms.

If you’re given non-hormone therapy, you’ll
likely also stay on ADT to make sure your
testosterone remains at the lowest possible
level. See Guide 2.

Carboplatin and cisplatin
Carboplatin and cisplatin are chemotherapy
drugs made from platinum. These are
sometimes used for patients with very
advanced or aggressive cancer. Usually,
either carboplatin or cisplatin is combined
with another chemotherapy medicine such as
cabazitaxel or docetaxel.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a systemic drug treatment
that damages rapidly dividing cells throughout
the body. Cancer cells divide and multiply
rapidly, which makes them a good target for
chemotherapy.
But chemotherapy can harm healthy cells, too.
That’s how it can cause side effects. Because
chemotherapy can be a tough treatment to go
through, it’s recommended only for those who
are able to physically tolerate it. Despite the
side effects, it can help people with metastatic
prostate cancer live significantly longer.

Mitoxantrone
Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) is used to
relieve pain and decrease the need for pain
medications. It’s an option if you aren’t able to
tolerate other therapies.

Chemotherapy for prostate cancer is a liquid
medicine given by intravenous infusion. This
means that it’s slowly injected into a vein for up
to an hour. It’s given every 3 weeks for a total
of 6 to 10 times (cycles), along with a daily
steroid.

The immune system is the body’s natural
defense against infection and disease.
Immunotherapy is a type of systemic therapy
that boosts the ability of your immune
system to find and destroy cancer cells.
Immunotherapy is usually given alone for
treating prostate cancer. Immunotherapy drugs
include sipuleucel-T and pembrolizumab.

Biomarker-targeted therapy

Lutetium-177
Lutetium-177 (Pluvicto) is a targeted
radiopharmaceutical that looks for a particular
protein (prostate-specific membrane antigen,
PSMA) on the surface of prostate cancer cells
anywhere in the body. When the drug finds
PSMA, it attaches itself to the cancer cells
and implants a small amount of its radioactive
substance in them. The cancer cells absorb
the radiation from the drug and die.

This treatment targets specific biomarkers that
are found through molecular tumor testing.
Biomarker-targeted therapies are useful only
in patients whose prostate cancer is due
to specific genetic mutations. This includes
mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and other
genes that repair damaged DNA. About 1 in
4 patients with metastatic hormone-resistant
prostate cancer have this kind of genetic
mutation.

Lutetium-177 is an intravenous infusion given
once every 6 weeks for up to 6 doses. You’ll
need a PSMA-PET scan to find out if this
treatment may work for you.

Biomarker-targeted therapies (also known
as PARP inhibitors) for advanced prostate
cancer include rucaparib (Rubraca), olaparib
(Lynparza), niraparib and abiraterone
(Akeega), and talazoparib (Talzenna). Because
genetic mutations differ between people, a
treatment that helps one person may not help
another.

Radium-223
Radium-223 (Xofigo) is used to treat prostate
cancer that has metastasized in bone but
hasn’t spread to other organs. Radium-223
collects in bones and gives off radiation that
can kill prostate cancer cells there. It’s an
injection given once a month for 6 months.
You’ll need to have blood tests before
each dose. A bone-targeting therapy, either
denosumab or zoledronic acid, is often given
with radium-223.

Radiopharmaceuticals
A radiopharmaceutical is a medicine that
contains a radioactive substance. This
radioactive substance releases radiation to
kill cancer cells. The radiation doesn’t travel
far from cancer cells so nearby healthy tissue
remains mostly unharmed.

Radium-223 is also used to reduce pain from
bone metastases.

Radiopharmaceuticals are injected into
a vein (intravenous injection). Because
radiopharmaceuticals leave the body through
the gut, common side effects are nausea,
diarrhea, and vomiting.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays, like
x-rays or gamma rays, to kill cancer cells and
shrink tumors. Radiation therapy is given in
regular doses over a certain period of time.

Radiopharmaceutical drugs include
lutetium-177 and radium-223:

radiation beam focuses directly on the cancer
while trying to avoid healthy tissue. This
technique delivers higher doses of radiation
more safely.

Therapy may also be given as part of a clinical
trial.

For metastatic prostate cancer, radiation
therapy is mainly used for treatment of
prostate cancer that returns after initial
treatment (recurrence). Radiation therapy is
also used as palliative treatment to relieve the
pain of bone metastases.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. Clinical trials are a key way to assess
new treatment approaches.
After being developed and tested in a
laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may be
approved by the FDA.

Radiation therapy (EBRT) is more commonly
used along with hormone therapy as the initial
treatment for patients who have early-stage
or regional prostate cancer. EBRT treats the
prostate as well as cancerous lymph nodes,
while hormone therapy lowers testosterone
to a minimal level to prevent the cancer from
getting worse.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Some of the possible side effects of radiation
therapy are urinary and bowel problems,
erectile dysfunction, and fatigue.

Black males have a higher risk of
developing and dying from prostate
cancer. But many may not know about
clinical trial opportunities. As a result,
not as much is known about whether new
treatments can work for Black males with
prostate cancer.
Everyone with cancer can ask for and
should be given information about clinical
trials. Knowing all the options means not
missing out on clinical trial opportunities
for promising new treatments.

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in certain ways in
order to compare how their disease responds
to a specific treatment.

Finding a clinical trial
In the United States

Informed consent

NCCN Cancer Centers

“

Supportive care

Without clinical trials, our
treatment wouldn’t change. It would
always remain the same. Some
people refer to clinical trials as
receiving tomorrow’s best treatment
today.”

Supportive care (also called palliative care)
treats cancer symptoms, the side effects of
cancer treatment, and other related health
issues. All patients with advanced cancer
should be offered supportive care.
Supportive care is important at any stage
of cancer, not just at the end of life. In fact,
people who start supportive care when they
begin treatment tend to have better quality of
life and potentially improved outcomes.

Bone-targeted therapy
Supportive care may be especially useful
for patients with bone metastases. Prostate
cancer that metastasizes to bones can cause
severe pain, fractures (breaks) in bones,
bone loss (osteoporosis), and squeezing
(compression) of the spinal cord.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It’s common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You’ll be informed if a
placebo is part of a clinical trial before you
enroll.

Also, some treatments for prostate cancer, like
hormone therapy, can cause osteoporosis and
increase your risk of fractures.

Are clinical trials free?
There’s no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or childcare due
to extra appointments.

If you’re at risk for osteoporosis, you may have
a bone mineral density test. This is a special
x-ray scan that measures how much calcium
and other minerals are in your bones. Bone
mineral density tests look for osteoporosis and
help predict your risk for bone fractures.

Depending on the trial, you may continue to
receive standard cancer care. The standard
therapy is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You’re responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that aren’t covered by
your insurance.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Advanced-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

You should have a follow-up bone mineral
density test after 1 year of hormone therapy.
You might also have blood tests to monitor
kidney function and calcium levels.

Shared decision-making
Some people with cancer want their doctors and treatment team to just tell them which treatment to
have. Doctors, nurses, and other providers are the experts, right? While it’s true that your treatment
team has lots of experience and knowledge, you’re also an expert—you’re the expert on you.
It’s a good idea for your team to share the responsibility of your treatment with you. And it’s a
good idea for you to fully participate in making decisions about your care.

Here’s what your treatment team
should share with you:

•

An explanation of the likely benefits and
potential harms of each treatment option.

•

The likelihood of cure, recurrence,
progression, and possible mortality with
each treatment option.

•

And here’s what you should share
with your treatment team:

The side effects of each treatment option
along with their impact on quality of life,
including sexual, urinary, and bowel
function.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Advanced-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

35

•

Your preferences and feelings about
treatment, side effects, risks, and quality
of life. These should be key parts of your
treatment plan.

•

If the provider who’s leading your
treatment team doesn’t have a talk with
you about shared decision-making, feel
free to speak up and ask about it.

Testosterone helps prostate cancer grow.
Hormone therapy treats prostate cancer
by stopping testosterone from being made
or by blocking cancer cells from using
testosterone.
Hormone therapy can eventually lose its
effectiveness against prostate cancer.
This becomes hormone-resistant prostate
cancer.
Hormone therapy is often combined with
one or more other therapies, which can
be more effective together at slowing or
shrinking advanced prostate cancer.
Other treatments used with hormone
therapy for advanced prostate cancer
include chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
target therapy, radiopharmaceuticals, and
radiation therapy.
Hormone therapy can cause a number of
possible side effects. But treatment and
therapy are available.
Supportive care relieves the symptoms
caused by cancer and the side effects
caused by its treatment. Everyone with
advanced-stage prostate cancer should
be offered supportive care.

About regional prostate
cancer

It’s important to know that life expectancy—
when used for cancer care—is an estimate
based on large numbers of people. That
means life expectancy can be applied to a
certain population or age range, but it’s not as
easy to make a precise estimate of the lifespan
of an individual person.

Regional prostate cancer is cancer that has
spread from the prostate gland to neighboring
tissue, such as nearby lymph nodes, the
bladder, or the rectum. But it hasn’t spread any
farther. (To read about prostate cancer that
has spread to distant lymph nodes, bones, or
organs, turn to Chapter 5.) Regional prostate
cancer is also sometimes called locally
advanced prostate cancer.

Life expectancy: More than 5 years
or you have symptoms
If your life expectancy is more than 5 years
or you have symptoms, treatment usually
includes:

Treatment

Radiation therapy
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT
along with long-term hormone therapy plus
abiraterone (Zytiga) is the preferred initial
treatment for patients who have regional
prostate cancer and a longer life expectancy
or symptoms. Preferred treatments are ones
that have the most scientific evidence that they
work well.

The key concern about prostate cancer that
spreads just outside the prostate is that it could
continue to spread farther (metastasize) to
other areas of the body. As a result, treatment
for regional prostate cancer is more aggressive
than treatment for early-stage prostate cancer.
Treatment takes aim at cancer in the prostate
itself as well as cancer outside the prostate. So
it often includes both local therapy (radiation
therapy or prostate surgery) and systemic
therapy (hormone therapy).
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Advanced-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

EBRT treats the prostate as well as cancerous
lymph nodes, while long-term hormone therapy
lowers testosterone to a minimal level to
prevent the cancer from getting worse. Long-

help patients live longer although it may also
come with more side effects.

Hormone therapy
Long-term hormone therapy consists of
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus
abiraterone, an androgen inhibitor. If you’re
taking abiraterone, you’ll also need to take a
steroid to reduce abiraterone’s side effects.

Prostate surgery
Prostatectomy means removing the prostate
gland through surgery. A radical prostatectomy
removes not only the entire prostate but also
the surrounding tissue and seminal vesicles.
A pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is an
operation to remove the nearby lymph nodes.

Another option for initial treatment is radiation
therapy plus long-term (2 to 3 years) ADT
without the addition of abiraterone. This
may be an option for those who can’t take
abiraterone due to other health conditions.

A radical prostatectomy with PLND is a
treatment option only in certain cases of
regional prostate cancer. It’s used when:

You have a life expectancy of 10 or more
years.

Urinary incontinence (being unable to hold
your urine) is usually temporary. Most patients
gradually recover control of their bladder
after a few months or so. Doing exercises
to strengthen the pelvic floor can help. If
incontinence continues to be a problem,
another surgical procedure can be done to
improve it.

You have no other serious health
conditions.

A radical prostatectomy is complex and
requires a great deal of skill. Surgeons who
are experienced in this type of surgery often
have better results.

Erectile dysfunction may slowly improve over
several months to 2 years after the surgery.
However, you may never regain the same
erectile function you once had. Treatment
options include pills (like Viagra and Cialis),
injections of medication into the penis, vacuum
constriction devices (“penis pump”), and
surgical implants that produce an erection.

Even so, sometimes cavernous nerve bundles
are damaged or removed during surgery. The
cavernous nerves control the ability to have
erections. These nerves run alongside the
prostate. Surgeons do their best to avoid these
nerves when performing a prostatectomy,
but damage to the nerves during surgery is
sometimes unavoidable. This damage can
cause side effects.

Erectile dysfunction is a leading cause of
depression in patients with prostate cancer.
Ask your care team about therapy or
counseling if you’re having any problems due
to erectile dysfunction or any symptoms of
depression. Help is available.

Possible side effects of radical prostatectomy
can include urinary incontinence and erectile
dysfunction.

About 1 in 8 people who are
diagnosed with prostate
cancer have prostate cancer
that is regional.

Additional therapy after prostate surgery
Because the surgeon is able to see inside your
body during prostate surgery, it often reveals
more details about your disease. It could show
that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph
nodes. Or there may be other signs of cancer
after the prostate is removed. In either case,
you might have additional treatment at some
point after the surgery.

I had a radical prostatectomy.
Because my prostate cancer was
very close to one nerve bundle,
I chose to have it removed
also. I wasn’t troubled by this
because I learned that there are
other ways of getting erections.
I wanted to live to see my
grandchildren grow up, and now
they have!”

If there are signs of remaining cancer but
no metastasis in lymph nodes, additional
treatment involves EBRT with or without added
hormone therapy.
But additional treatment, like any treatment,
comes with some risk of side effects. So
instead of active therapy, your care team may
suggest that you delay additional treatment but
have regular testing until signs or symptoms
(such as a rising PSA level) begin to occur.
This is called monitoring.

Life expectancy: 5 years or less
and you have no symptoms
Treatment is less aggressive for people with
regional prostate cancer whose life expectancy
is 5 years or less and who have no symptoms:

If prostate surgery shows that the cancer
has spread to the lymph nodes, monitoring
may still be an option. If active therapy is
recommended instead, the treatment involves
ADT with or without EBRT.

Observation
Observation is an option for patients with a life
expectancy of 5 years or less. It’s for those
with other serious health problems whose
prostate cancer isn’t causing any symptoms.
Observation involves occasional PSA tests and
watching for symptoms, which can be treated
with pain-relieving (palliative) therapy.
ADT
ADT on its own is an option for patients with
regional disease, no symptoms, and a life
expectancy of 5 years or less. It’s used to
slow cancer and delay or reduce symptoms.
ADT may include an LHRH agonist, an LHRH
antagonist, or surgical removal of the testicles.

Follow-up after treatment

Treatment for persistence
or recurrence

After initial treatment, you’ll have follow-up
tests to find out how well your therapy worked.
Periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests
and occasional imaging scans can indicate
whether the cancer is under control.

If you have PSA persistence or recurrence
after your initial therapy, your life expectancy
will guide what treatment you may have next.

More than 5 years

PSA is very low or undetectable

Before deciding on any treatment, you’ll need
some more tests to find out how aggressive
the cancer may be. Tests include PSA doubling
time; imaging with CT, MRI, or whole-body
PET scan; and possibly a biopsy. Results of
these tests will indicate your next treatment.

If your PSA is very low after radiation therapy
or undetectable after prostate surgery, you’ll be
monitored for cancer recurrence.
Monitoring involves PSA testing every 6 to 12
months for several years. Patients with a high
risk of recurrence may have PSA testing more
often, such as every 3 months. You’ll continue
to be monitored on an ongoing basis or until
signs or symptoms occur.

In addition, treatment for cancer persistence
or recurrence is based on whether your initial
treatment for regional prostate cancer was
radiation therapy or prostate surgery. See

Guide 4.

PSA is elevated or rising

5 years or less

If your PSA doesn’t fall to an undetectable level
after prostate surgery, you may still have cancer
(persistence). Or, if your PSA drops after initial
treatment but then later rises again, it probably
means the cancer has come back (recurrence).
In either case, further treatment is available.

If your life expectancy is 5 years or less,
observation may be a better option than
undergoing treatment. Observation involves
checking up on your prostate cancer and
watching for symptoms.
If symptoms develop, treatment is often
focused on easing or stopping them instead of
trying to cure the cancer. This allows patients
to maintain a good quality of life without the
burden of unnecessary treatment.

Regional prostate cancer has spread from
the prostate gland to neighboring tissue,
but no farther.
The main concern about regional prostate
cancer is that it could continue to spread
to other areas of the body.
Treatment for regional prostate cancer
often includes both local therapy and
systemic therapy.
The preferred initial treatment for regional
prostate cancer in people with a longer
life expectancy or symptoms is external
beam radiation therapy (EBRT), long-term
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and
abiraterone.
Treatment is less aggressive for people
with regional prostate cancer whose life
expectancy is 5 years or less and who
have no symptoms.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
persistence is when your PSA doesn’t fall
to an undetectable level. This indicates
the cancer hasn’t gone away.
PSA recurrence is when your PSA level
drops after initial treatment but rises
again. This indicates the cancer has come
back.

the treatment options for distant

The aim of ADT is to reduce androgens

is called castration level, which is when there’s
nearly zero testosterone in the bloodstream.

metastatic prostate cancer.

About metastatic prostate
cancer

Patients whose metastatic prostate cancer is
newly diagnosed will begin ADT to get their
testosterone down to castration level. Patients
with metastatic prostate cancer who are
already being treated with ADT will continue
the treatment to keep testosterone at a
minimal level.

Metastatic prostate cancer is cancer that has
spread (metastasized) outside the prostate and
beyond the pelvis to other areas of the body.
Areas where prostate cancer tends to spread
are:




ADT comes in a few forms. These include
drugs (an LHRH agonist with or without an
anti-androgen, or an LHRH antagonist) or
sometimes surgery (removal of the testicles).

Lymph nodes farther away from the
prostate

Although ADT is the main therapy for
advanced prostate cancer, it’s not usually
given on its own any more. Adding one or two
additional therapies to ADT may help you live
longer and with fewer symptoms.

Bones in the spine, pelvis, or ribs
Organs such as the liver, lungs, brain, or
others

You may have metastatic cancer when you’re
first diagnosed. Or your cancer may become
metastatic after you’ve already had treatment
for early-stage or regional prostate cancer.

Additional therapies include second hormone
therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
targeted therapy, and radiopharmaceuticals.
You may hear this called doublet therapy (ADT
+ another therapy) or triplet therapy (ADT +
two additional therapies).

Metastatic prostate cancer can be difficult
to treat. However, a variety of therapies are
available to target the cancer, stop or slow its
progress, reduce symptoms, and prolong life.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Advanced-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

Which additional therapy you’ll have depends
on a number of considerations. The first
consideration is whether ADT is still effective

for you. To put it into medical terms, is your
cancer hormone resistant or is it hormone
sensitive?

That is, hormone therapy can still treat it. You
may also hear it called by its former name,
castration-naïve prostate cancer, which means
that hormone therapy is a new (“naïve”)
treatment for the cancer.

Hormone-resistant prostate cancer
(also called castration-resistant prostate
cancer) is cancer that learns how to grow
without using testosterone as its fuel. As
a result, hormone therapy is no longer as
effective against it—most of the cancer
becomes “resistant” to ADT.

If this describes your cancer, read the following
section about treatment options for hormonesensitive prostate cancer.

Hormone-sensitive
treatment

If you’ve had ADT but it’s no longer working
well, go to page 49 to read about treatment
options for hormone-resistant metastatic
prostate cancer.

As its name implies, hormone-sensitive
metastatic prostate cancer is treated mainly
with hormone therapy. ADT is considered the
first hormone therapy. But a second hormonereducing therapy is commonly added to ADT
for treating advanced prostate cancer. It
can prevent your cancer from growing and
spreading farther. See Guide 5.

Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer
(also called castration-sensitive prostate
cancer) is not currently being treated with ADT
or has never been treated with ADT. (This
doesn’t include ADT given as short-term
additional therapy, such as hormone therapy
given during radiation therapy.) As a result,
this cancer is “sensitive” to hormone therapy.

“When you are deciding on your
treatment options, remember that
even though some decisions need
to be made fast, don’t rush. Think
through your options and get
second, or even third opinions.
Have people you can trust to talk
through your options so you feel
comfortable in your decisions.”

Preferred treatments

medicine (docetaxel) plus a hormone-reducing
medicine (either abiraterone or darolutamide).

Preferred treatments are ones that have the
most scientific evidence that they work well.
Preferred treatment options for hormonesensitive prostate cancer include ADT plus a
second hormone-reducing medicine. Medical
research has shown that patients on ADT
plus another hormone-reducing medicine
tend to live longer than those on ADT alone.
The preferred second hormone-reducing
medicines are abiraterone, apalutamide, and
enzalutamide. Your care team will talk to you
about which medicine might work best for you.

This adds up to a lot of medicine. So triplet
therapy is only recommended for people who
have high-volume prostate cancer who also
can physically tolerate chemotherapy while
on hormone therapy, plus other treatment.
High-volume prostate cancer means having
multiple metastases in bones and/or at least
one metastasis in an internal organ. (Prostate
cancer that has spread to an internal organ is
called a visceral metastasis.)

Other treatments

If you’re prescribed abiraterone, you’ll also be
given a steroid medication. The steroid helps
reduce the side effects of abiraterone.

Low-volume prostate cancer means having
zero to a few metastases in bones and/or
some metastases in distant lymph nodes, with
no metastases in internal organs.

Other preferred treatments for hormonesensitive metastatic prostate cancer are triplet

Hormone-resistant
treatment

For patients with low-volume hormonesensitive prostate cancer, ADT plus external
beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the
metastases is recommended to help stop the
cancer from spreading farther. In some cases,
abiraterone (or docetaxel chemotherapy)
is given in addition to ADT and EBRT for a
stronger effect.

Hormone-resistant metastatic prostate cancer
is cancer that keeps growing even when
testosterone is at a very low level. How? Some
cancer cells learn to survive without the usual
supply of testosterone. Also, the cancer may
get some androgens from the adrenal glands,
which make a small amount of testosterone.
Even the tumor itself can create androgens
that help cancer cells grow. As these cells
multiply, ADT gradually loses its effectiveness
against the cancer.

ADT used by itself is usually not recommended
for hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate
cancer, except for patients who aren’t able to
handle side effects or take other medicines.

Follow-up visits

ADT

After treatment, you’ll have follow-up tests on
a regular basis to see how well the treatment
is working and to check for any signs or
symptoms that the cancer has returned.

To treat hormone-resistant metastatic prostate
cancer, your testosterone needs to remain at
castration level. So it’s still important to stay
on ADT. Your care team may keep you on
your same ADT treatment or might ask you to
switch to a different medicine.

If follow-up tests find that treatment isn’t
working and your hormone-sensitive prostate
cancer is growing or spreading, then you may
have developed hormone-resistant prostate
cancer. This is discussed next.

Besides ADT, your care team will recommend
additional treatment. See Guide 6 and
Guide 7. Which treatment you’ll receive will
depend on a few factors. These include:


Your previous treatment (if any)



Location of the metastasis in your body



Amount of metastatic disease



Symptoms



Potential side effects

immunotherapy, biomarker-targeted therapies,
and radiopharmaceuticals—or a combination
of these treatments.



If you were first diagnosed with early prostate
cancer or hormone-sensitive prostate cancer,
then you may have already had ADT and
chemotherapy or next-generation hormone
therapy. Having had either of these therapies
will affect which treatment you’ll have next.



Second hormone therapy

Abiraterone (Zytiga)



Enzalutamide (Xtandi)

ADT plus chemotherapy can be the first
treatment for metastatic prostate cancer or it
can be given later if other treatments haven’t
worked well. Chemotherapy can be given as
a single drug (such as docetaxel) or as a pair
(cabazitaxel and carboplatin) if the cancer is
more aggressive.
Docetaxel is the preferred chemotherapy.
Other chemotherapy drugs may be used in
certain cases. These include cabazitaxel,
cisplatin, carboplatin, and mitoxantrone.
You can also take a steroid (prednisone or
dexamethasone) to reduce the side effects of
chemotherapy.

Other second hormone therapy
If the preferred second hormone therapies
don’t slow down your cancer, there are other
hormone-reducing options:




Adding one of the early-generation antiandrogens (nilutamide, flutamide, or
bicalutamide) may be effective if newer
hormone therapies aren’t an option due to
cost or availability.
Stopping an anti-androgen may also be
effective. Sometimes stopping the drug
has the opposite effect of lowering PSA
levels in some patients.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Advanced-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

Ketoconazole (Nizoral) is a pill that’s
occasionally prescribed when second
hormone therapy or chemotherapy can’t
be used or isn’t available. It’s taken with
a steroid (hydrocortisone) to reduce side
effects such as nausea and vomiting.

Chemotherapy

ADT is the first hormone therapy used for
treating metastatic prostate cancer. If prostate
cancer becomes hormone resistant, then
a second hormone therapy is commonly
added. A second hormone therapy may
be able to slow down your cancer or keep
it from spreading farther. The preferred
second therapy options include newer (nextgeneration) hormone therapies:


A corticosteroid (hydrocortisone,
prednisone, or dexamethasone) can be
a hormone-reducing therapy itself when
used in addition to ADT.

Immunotherapy



Immunotherapy drugs boost the body’s own
immune system to fight cancer. However,
immunotherapy for prostate cancer is used
only for certain patients. Immunotherapy drugs
include:


Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) can be used
for patients whose hormone-resistant
metastatic prostate cancer is causing
few or no symptoms. Such patients
usually have less cancer and a stronger
immune system, which allows this
immunotherapy to be more effective.
Sipuleucel-T is not recommended for
those whose prostate cancer has spread
to internal organs.

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is
recommended only for patients whose
hormone-resistant metastatic prostate
cancer has grown or spread despite
having chemotherapy and second
hormone therapy. Patients’ test results
will also show specific genetic changes
(defects in DNA called mismatch repair
deficiency and high microsatellite
instability).

Targeted therapy
Biomarker-targeted therapies are useful only in
patients whose hormone-resistant metastatic
prostate cancer is linked with specific genetic
mutations. These drugs are called PARP
inhibitors because they target PARP, which is a

Lutetium-177 (Pluvicto) isn’t used until
after both a second hormone therapy and
chemotherapy (docetaxel or cabazitaxel)
have been given. First, you’ll have PSMAPET imaging to confirm the treatment
could work.
Radium-223 (Xofigo) can be used if
prostate cancer has spread mainly to
bones but not to internal organs. It should
only be used in combination with ADT,
not with second hormone therapy or
chemotherapy.

Niraparib and abiraterone (Akeega) plus
prednisone is a new targeted therapy
for patients with a BRCA mutation.
Patients should also be on an LHRH
agonist, LHRH antagonist, or have had
orchiectomy (surgical removal of the
testicles).

Talazoparib (Talzenna), taken with
enzalutamide (Xtandi), is another new

Metastatic prostate cancer has spread
outside the prostate and beyond the
pelvis to other areas of the body, such as
distant lymph nodes, bones, or organs.
The first treatment for advanced
metastatic prostate cancer is usually ADT.
Adding another therapy or two to ADT
may help you live longer and with fewer
symptoms.
Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is
treated mainly with hormone therapy.
Hormone-resistant prostate cancer
has learned how to grow without using
testosterone as its fuel. It’s treated with
ADT and another type of therapy—often a
newer hormone therapy or chemotherapy.
Second hormone therapy is commonly
added to ADT as a preferred treatment
option for advanced prostate cancer.

Supportive care is for relieving the symptoms
of cancer, the side effects of cancer therapies,
and other health issues related to the cancer.
Supportive care also helps with psychological,
social, and spiritual issues.

you feel better and answer your
questions.

Supportive care involves the whole person, not
just their cancer. Supportive care addresses
many needs. It can help with making treatment
decisions. It can also assist with coordinating
care between health providers. Notably,
supportive care can help prevent or treat
physical and emotional symptoms. Supportive
care can also help with financial support,
advance care planning, and end-of-life
concerns.

The main concern for most patients with
cancer is to find treatment that works. Having
cancer is about more than just treatment,
though. Cancer care can be a rollercoaster
that includes many additional physical and
emotional challenges. It’s important to know
that you can get support for these challenges.

It’s important to talk openly with your treatment
team about supportive care. Some medical
centers have patient navigators or other
staff members who coordinate nonclinical
supportive care. Ask questions and reach out
if you need more information about supportive
care.

Many people with prostate cancer experience
symptoms of distress, such as anxiety and
depression. You may feel anxious during
testing, or you may experience depression
during a hard part of treatment, or because
your life is not the same as it was before

Help can include support groups, talk therapy,

navigators, social workers, and other experts
can help. Some people also feel better by
exercising, talking with loved ones, or relaxing.

Support groups

It’s important to ask for help

Many people diagnosed with cancer find support
groups to be helpful. A support group provides
the opportunity to talk with others who are
going through, or have been through, similar
experiences. Support groups often include
people at different stages of treatment. Some
people may be newly diagnosed, while others
may be finished with treatment. If your hospital
or community doesn’t have support groups for
people with cancer, have a look at the online
resources listed on page 72 of this book.

Depression, anxiety, fear, and distress
are very common feelings for people
with cancer. These feelings can make it
harder to deal with cancer and cancer
treatment. They can hold you back
even when you want to move forward.
Getting help when you’re feeling
worried or hopeless is an important
part of cancer care. If you’re feeling
anxious or overwhelmed, ask your
treatment team for help.

Financial concerns

More information about cancer and
distress is available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

The financial cost of prostate cancer can be
overwhelming. As a result, many people with
prostate cancer and their loved ones struggle
with the cost of treatment, as well as the stress
of paying for it.
To make things worse, you may miss work
during treatment or become unemployed. Or
you may have trouble paying for or getting
medicines. Or you may have too little or no
health insurance.

You can also talk to your treatment team about
work, health insurance, or money problems.
Your team can include information in your
treatment plan to help you manage your
finances and medical costs. If your doctors and
care providers don’t talk about how to pay for
treatment, it’s okay for you to ask them about it
first.

If you struggle to pay for food, housing,
treatment, follow-up care, and other expenses,
or you have difficulty getting to appointments,
talk with your care team’s social worker, patient
navigator, and hospital financial services staff.
They can help you find financial support and
transportation options.

Survivorship
Survivorship focuses on the health and wellbeing of a person with cancer from diagnosis
until the end of life. This includes the physical,
mental, emotional, social, and financial effects
of cancer that begin at diagnosis, continue
through treatment, and arise afterward.

Consider quality of life
Quality of life is a term used often in
cancer care. It refers to a person’s
overall enjoyment of life, including
their sense of well-being and ability
to participate in regular activities.
For some people, aggressive cancer
treatment may extend their life but
reduce their quality of life. That’s one
reason why quality of life should be an
important consideration when making
decisions about cancer treatment.

Survivorship also includes concerns about
follow-up care, late effects of treatment, cancer
recurrence, and quality of life. Support from
family members, friends, and caregivers is also
an important part of survivorship.
Read more about survivorship in NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Survivorship Care
for Healthy Living and Survivorship Care for
Cancer-Related Late and Long-Term Effects,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Advance care planning is for everyone, not
just for those who are very sick. Advance care
planning means deciding what care you would
want if you become unable to make medical
decisions for yourself. It’s about making
sure that your wishes are understood and
respected.

Advance care planning

The focus is on you receiving the best possible
care at the end of your life. Patients with
incurable cancer can set up an advance care
plan early to help them feel less stressed and
better able to cope with their condition.

When cancer is diagnosed at an advanced
stage or keeps progressing despite all
treatment efforts, it may be time to consider
what lies ahead. Even when cancers are
curable, talking about future scenarios should
begin when starting treatment. This exploration
of what’s important to you is called advance
care planning.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

advance directive when you’re too ill to make
decisions about your care.
Tell your care team and family about your
advance directive and its contents. Give a
copy of your advance directive to all your
doctors. Make sure you give a copy to anyone
you’ve authorized to make decisions on your
behalf (health care proxy). If your family or
loved ones disagree with your plan, speak
to your care team. Sometimes they or other
specialists can help you and your family
navigate these difficult conversations.

Make your wishes clear. It’s important that
everyone clearly understands the goals of your
care and your personal wishes about what
should—and should not—be done. You can
decide if there is a point where you might want
to stop cancer treatment. You can also decide
what treatments you would want for symptom
relief.

You can change your advance care plan at any
time. Frequent conversations with your care
team can help.

Once you’ve made these decisions, you’ll fill
out a legal document that explains what you
want to be done if you aren’t able to tell your
care team yourself. This document is called an
advance directive. Your health care providers
are required to follow the instructions in an

or hospice. Note that hospice is a special kind
of end-of-life care. Hospice refers specifically
to an insurance benefit for people whose
life expectancy is 6 months or less. Hospice
supports those at the end of life by bringing in
additional care providers and resources such
as home care.





The goal of end-of-life care is to give people the
best life possible with the time they have left.
Care can be provided in your home, a hospice
facility, or even in the hospital. A major goal is to
keep you pain-free and make sure that you can
leave this world comfortably and with dignity.
Hospice doctors, nurses, social workers, and
chaplains are experts in helping patients work
through the spiritual and emotional challenges
of coping with the end of life.









Providing support for family members is a
key part of hospice care. Most programs offer
counseling and support groups for family
members, including support after the patient
has died. This is referred to as bereavement. It
can be very comforting to know that your loved
ones will have that kind of support after you’re
gone.

specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your care
team.

conversation with your care team
about the benefits and risks of
treatment.

Second opinion
It’s normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer treatment shouldn’t
be ignored, there is usually time to have
another cancer care provider review your test
results and suggest a treatment plan. This
is called getting a second opinion, and it’s a
normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
Treatment decisions are very personal. What’s
important to you may not be important to
someone else. In shared decision-making, you
and your care team share information, discuss
the options, and agree on a treatment plan. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment. It starts with
an open and honest conversation between you
and your team.

Seek out a prostate cancer specialist, if you
can, because they have experience diagnosing
and treating a lot of people with your type of
cancer.

Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:








Things you can do to prepare:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want
Your religious and spiritual beliefs
Your feelings about certain treatments like
hormone therapy or radiation



Your feelings about pain or side effects
Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions.
There may be out-of-pocket costs to
see providers who are not part of your
insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records and imaging scans sent to the
doctor you will see for your second
opinion.

Things to think about
when making treatment decisions
Be sure to weigh all your options. There are no "correct" answers. The right decision is the one
that’s best for you. Consider:
Your personal preferences

vs.

Your health care providers’
recommendations

Having definitive treatment

vs.

Keeping other treatment options open

Length of life

vs.

Quality of life

Traveling for treatment

vs.

Staying close to home and family

Having more treatment

vs.

Having more side effects

Having standard treatment now, which is
covered by your health plan

vs.

Waiting for specialized treatment, which
requires your health plan’s approval

Questions to ask
Possible questions to ask your care providers
are listed on the following pages. Feel free to
use these or come up with your own. Have a
notebook handy to jot down the answers to
your questions.
