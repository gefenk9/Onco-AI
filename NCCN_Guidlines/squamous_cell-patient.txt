About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the
NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology
(NCCN Guidelines®) for Squamous Cell Skin Cancer,
Version 1.2023 – March 10, 2023.

Squamous cell skin cancer is the

Squamous cell skin cancers often begin as
scaly patches on the skin that can become
solid and misshapen. This cancer is also called
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).
This patient guide is about squamous cell skin
cancer only. The terms “squamous cell skin
cancer” and “CSCC” are used interchangeably
throughout this guide.

second most common type of skin
cancer. It is highly treatable and
can often be cured.

Squamous cell skin cancer is a common skin
cancer, especially in fair-skinned people.
It is the second most common type of skin
cancer, after basal cell carcinoma. The third
type—melanoma—is much less common than
the other types but can be more aggressive.
Because they do not behave like melanoma,
basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are
often referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancers
or keratinocyte carcinomas.

Skin basics
Your skin is the largest organ of the body. Skin
protects you from invaders (such as microbes),
helps control body temperature, and allows the
sensations of touch, heat, and cold.
Skin has 3 layers:


Cancer that starts in a squamous cell is called a
squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cells are
found in the top layer of the skin. They can also
be found in other areas of the body, such as the
lungs, thyroid, and esophagus. These types are
treated differently than cutaneous squamous
cell carcinoma.





Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of
skin that provides a waterproof barrier and
creates skin color (melanin).
Dermis contains connective tissue, hair
follicles, and sweat glands.
Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest
layer, made up of fat and connective tissue.

Squamous cells

Layers and cell structure

Squamous cell skin cancer basics » Risk factors

Risk factors

Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis.
There are 3 main types of cells in the
epidermis:






A risk factor is something that increases the
chances of getting a disease. For example,
smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for
developing lung cancer. The major risk factors
for squamous cell skin cancer are described
next.

Squamous cells: These cells are thin,
flat cells that look like fish scales, and are
found in the tissue that forms the surface
of the skin.
Basal cells: These cells are found in
the lower part of the epidermis, called the
basal cell layer. Basal cells constantly
divide to form new cells to replace the
squamous cells that wear off of the skin’s
surface. As these cells move up in the
epidermis, they get flatter, eventually
becoming squamous cells.

Sunlight/outdoor tanning
Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused
by spending too much time in the sun over the
course of many years, especially in people
who sunburn easily. People with light skin, hair,
and eyes who have been in the sun very often
throughout their lives are at the highest risk for
squamous cell skin cancer. People who work
outdoors are also at higher risk. Because longterm sun exposure can lead to squamous cell
skin cancer, it is more common in people who
have spent more years in the sun.

Melanocytes: These cells are found
in the top layer of skin. Melanin is
produced in the melanocytes. Melanin
is responsible for the color of our hair,
skin, and eyes. In addition to providing
color, melanin also protects our skin from
harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.

Sun exposure
Most squamous cell skin
cancers are caused by
spending too much time
in the sun over a long
period of time, frequent
tanning, and getting
sunburns.

Squamous cell skin cancer basics » Risk factors

Indoor tanning

Actinic keratosis on the hand

Indoor tanning is a major risk factor for
squamous cell skin cancer. Using all types of
indoor tanning machines (eg, booths, beds)
increases the risk of getting any type of skin
cancer.

An actinic keratosis is an area of
rough skin caused by being in the
sun over time.

Environmental toxins
People who are often exposed to pollutants
such as tobacco smoke, exhaust from cars
or other vehicles, and arsenic (which can be
found in soil, water, and air) can experience
skin damage that can lead to squamous cell
carcinoma.

Scars and chronic wounds
CSCC can form in scars or chronic (nonhealing) wounds, such as ulcers (sores) and
burns. This is known as Marjolin’s ulcer. CSCC
that starts in damaged, inflamed, or scarred
skin is difficult to treat and more likely to come
back after treatment.

Actinic keratosis on top of head
Actinic keratoses can vary in
appearance and may be red, white,
tan, or pink in color.

Actinic keratoses
An actinic keratosis is an area of scaly or
rough skin caused by exposure to the sun over
time that may become squamous cell skin
cancer. Actinic keratoses vary in appearance,
and may be red, white, tan, or pink in color.
They may appear as small scaly spots
(lesions) or stick out from the skin like bumps.
Some may even look like warts.
Having actinic keratoses means you are at
increased risk of developing squamous cell
skin cancer. It is important that you have your
skin looked at by a doctor or dermatologist.

Genetic syndromes

immunosuppressants, also reduce the body’s
ability to fight infection and disease.

Having certain genetic syndromes means
you are at higher risk of getting squamous
cell skin cancer. While there are many, these
syndromes include:




The immune system also may not work well if
you have other health conditions, such as:


Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a
condition in which the body isn’t able
to repair damage to DNA caused by
sunlight. Skin cells with a lot of DNA
damage can eventually become skin
cancers.





Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cancer of
white blood cells in bone marrow)
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
AIDS

Any of these conditions can weaken the
immune system, which can increase the risk of
getting squamous cell skin cancer. Everyone
with this condition should undergo skin cancer
screening on a regular basis.

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis
bullosa (RDEB), a form of a rare, inherited
skin disorder that causes the skin to
become very fragile. Any trauma to the
skin can cause painful blisters.

NCCN recommends that people with these or
other genetic syndromes should be referred
to a cancer center with expertise in CSCC
prevention and treatment.

Diagnosis
If you have an area of abnormal-looking skin
(called a lesion) that looks like it could be skin
cancer, the next step is testing. This will likely
include:

NCCN also recommends that those with a
genetic risk of skin cancer receive counseling
from someone with expertise in cancer
genetics throughout the treatment process.
This might be a genetic counselor, medical
geneticist, endocrinologist, oncologist,
surgeon, or an oncology nurse.



A full health history



A close examination of the lesion(s)



Weakened immune system
When your immune system is weakened, your
body has trouble fighting off viruses, bacteria,
and fungi. This can lead to infections and other
health risks. Having a weakened immune
system can put you at risk of squamous cell
skin cancer. An example of when this happens
is after organ transplantation. If you received
an organ from another person, you likely
take drugs to stop your body from attacking
the donated organ. These drugs, called

diagnose squamous cell skin cancer. Your
sample should be reviewed by a pathologist.
The pathologist will note the overall
appearance and the size, shape, and type of
your cells.

Create a medical binder

There are several ways to do a skin biopsy.
Your doctor will choose one based on the size
of the affected area, where it is on your body,
and other factors. Any biopsy is likely to leave
at least a small scar. Different methods can
result in different types of scars. Talk to your
doctor about the type of biopsy and the risk of
scarring before you have the biopsy.

A medical binder or notebook is a great way
to organize all of your records in one place.

3 Make copies of blood tests, imaging

results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

No matter which type of biopsy is done, it
should remove as much of the suspected
area as possible for an accurate diagnosis to
be made.

3 Choose a binder that meets your

needs. Consider a zipper pocket to
include a pen, small calendar, and
insurance cards.

Skin biopsies are done using a local
anesthetic (numbing medicine), which is
injected into the area with a very small
needle. You will likely feel a small prick and
a little stinging as the medicine is injected,
but you should not feel any pain during the
biopsy.

3 Create folders for insurance forms,

test types (blood, imaging, pathology,
radiology, and genetics), treatments,
and procedures. Organize items in the
folder by date.

3 Use online patient portals to view

Skin shave biopsy
A skin shave biopsy can be done on the skin
surface (superficial) or deeper. Superficial
shave biopsies are useful for very flat skin
lesions. This type of biopsy removes the
top layer of skin (epidermis) and part of the
dermis using a tool similar to a razor.

Imaging tests

Cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma (CSCC)

Your doctor may use imaging scans to see
if you have cancer beyond the suspiciouslooking lesion, such as in the bone, nerves, or
surrounding deep soft tissue. You may have a
computed tomography (CT) scan or an MRI.

A CT scan is a procedure that uses a computer

For both a CT scan and an MRI, a liquid called
a contrast dye may be injected into a vein to
help your tissues and organs show up more
clearly in the picture. Using a contrast dye for
both the CT scan and the MRI is preferred
unless it is contraindicated, which means you
have an allergy or condition that could result in
a harmful reaction.

that is not normal.
Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET
scans. Not all bright spots are cancer. When
a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a
PET/CT scan.

The tracer travels through your blood and
collects in organs and tissues. This helps the
radiologist see certain areas more clearly. You
may need to wait for the tracer to be absorbed
by your body, which takes about 1 hour.

Confirmed CSCC
Once a diagnosis of CSCC is made, your
doctor will follow up with:

The tracer is attached to a substance that your
cells and tissues use. Cancer cells use the
substance differently than non-cancer cells.

Cancer cells can travel through blood and
a fluid called lymph to form tumors in other
parts of the body. Lymph nodes are small,
bean-shaped structures that are part of the
body's immune system. Lymph nodes filter
substances that travel through the lymphatic
fluid. They contain lymphocytes (white blood
cells) that help the body fight infection and
disease.





If your lymph nodes feel larger than they
should be, cancer may have spread to
the lymph nodes (this is also called “nodal
disease”). To find out, your doctor will use a
needle biopsy to take a sample from the lymph
node for testing.

Squamous cell skin cancer that has not spread
to nearby lymph nodes is referred to as “local”

Squamous cell skin cancer is the second
most common type of skin cancer. It is
highly treatable and can often be cured.
Squamous cell skin cancer is most
commonly caused by getting sunburns or
spending too much time in the sun over
many years.
An actinic keratosis is an area of scaly or
rough skin that has a higher chance of
becoming squamous cell skin cancer.
You may be more likely to get squamous
cell skin cancer if you have actinic
keratoses, a weakened immune system,
or certain genetic syndromes.
Squamous cell skin cancer can form in
old wounds, burns, or scars. This is called
Marjolin’s ulcer and it can be harder to
treat.
Testing for CSCC could include a full
health history, an examination of any
lesions, and a skin biopsy to remove a
sample and test it for cancer.
Imaging scans will also be done if cancer
goes deeper into the skin or has spread
to other parts of the body.
Cancer cells can travel through blood and
lymph fluid to form tumors in other parts
of the body. If spread to lymph nodes is
suspected, your doctor will do a lymph
node biopsy.

Who is on my care team?

Plastic surgeons are doctors who can
remove cancer as well as reconstruct, restore,
and repair body parts. They may work with a
pathologist at the time of your surgery for more
immediate results. They are trained to close
a wound after surgery, especially if it involves
deeper tissue where general anesthesia may
be needed.

After being diagnosed with squamous cell
skin cancer, knowing what to do next can be
confusing. Aside from your oncologist (your
cancer doctor), there are others who may be
involved in your cancer care.
Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout your treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it. Get to know
your care team and let them get to know you.

Head and neck surgeons are doctors who
are trained to treat conditions (cancerous and
noncancerous) of the deeper parts of the head
and neck, including the ears, nose, and throat.

Depending on your diagnosis, your care team
might include the following:
Dermatologists are doctors who diagnose
and treat skin conditions, including skin cancer.
They also do skin exams and can teach you
how to do them on your own.

Radiation oncologists are doctors who
are trained to use different types of radiation
therapy.
Pharmacists are medical professionals who
are trained to prepare and give out medicine
and explain their proper use and any side
effects. Some pharmacists specifically work
with people with cancer.

Mohs surgeons are doctors (usually
dermatologists) who have advanced training
in Mohs surgery and reconstruction after
surgery. They remove the tumor, ensure no
more cancer can be seen using a microscope,

Types of treatments » Superficial treatments

Superficial treatments

Geneticists are doctors who study how traits
are passed down from parents to children
through genes. They are trained to diagnose
and treat genetic disorders and counsel people
and families at risk.

Treatments that affect only the top layer of
the skin are called superficial treatments.
They may be used to treat the earliest form
of squamous cell skin cancer, called Bowen’s
disease. They are also used for actinic
keratoses (pre-cancerous lesions) that are in
the same general area as the Bowen’s lesion.

Oncology nurses are nurses who provide
hands-on care, like giving systemic therapy,
managing your care, answering questions, and
helping you cope with side effects. Sometimes,
these experts are called nurse navigators.

Photodynamic therapy

You know your body better than anyone. Help
other team members understand:

Your goals for treatment

In photodynamic therapy (PDT), a lightsensitive drug is applied to the area. When
exposed to light (either red or blue light in the
doctor’s office, or shaded outdoor light), the
drug becomes active and kills cancer cells.
Common side effects of PDT include itching or
burning when the liquid is applied, pain during
the red or blue light exposure, and itching and
redness for a few days after treatment.

Keep a list of names and contact information
for each member of your team. This will make
it easier for you and anyone involved in your
care to know whom to contact with questions
or concerns.

keratosis. Calcipotriene is a form of vitamin D
that activates the skin’s immune system.

Cryotherapy (also called cryosurgery) freezes
and destroys precancerous and cancerous
cells using a very cold liquid or tool. Liquid
nitrogen is often used. Cryotherapy sometimes
causes a burning sensation during treatment.
A blister and scab will form, which heals over
2 to 3 weeks. Skin darkening or lightening can
happen while it is healing.

Imiquimod belongs to a group of drugs
known as immune response modifiers. This
cream can help fight abnormal skin growths
by activating the immune system to damage
abnormal skin cells.
Tirbanibulin (Klisyri) is another topical therapy
used to treat actinic keratosis. Tirbanibulin
is a type of medication called a microtubule
inhibitor. It works by killing fast-growing cells,
such as the abnormal cells that cause actinic
keratoses. It is applied to the face or scalp 1
time a day for 5 days in a row (consecutive)
using a single-dose packet with each
application.

Topical therapies
Topical therapies are treatments that are
applied to the skin.
5-fluorouracil (Carac, Efudex, Fluoroplex)
and imiquimod (Aldara) are prescription
creams used to treat early CSCC and actinic
keratoses. 5-fluorouracil (also called 5-FU)
is chemotherapy applied directly to the skin,
unlike most chemotherapy that is put into the
bloodstream.

Thickening of the outer layer of skin is known
as hyperkeratosis. The goal is to soften
and break down this thick top layer before
treatment. For hyperkeratotic (thick and rough)
actinic keratoses, one or more of the following
may be used before treatment with the
therapies described above.

A cream called calcipotriene (Sorilux, Dovonex)
is often used with 5-fluorouracil to treat actinic

means cutting out the tumor along with a small
margin of normal skin.

Curettage (scraping away skin with a
spoon-shaped tool)

Curettage and electrodesiccation
(C&E)

Topical keratolytics (also called topical
urea, lactic acid, or salicylic acid)

C&E is done in a medical office with local
numbing to the area. In this method, the
visible tumor is first scraped off using a thin
tool with a sharp loop or spoon at the end.
Next, an electric needle is used to cauterize
(burn) the base of the wound. This usually kills
any remaining cancer cells and helps stop
bleeding. This two-step system of scraping
then burning may be done up to three times
in the same session. C&E is a recommended
option for early CSCC on the surface of the
skin that has not spread to lymph nodes.

Other therapies that are sometimes used for
actinic keratoses include topical diclofenac,
chemical peels (trichloroacetic acid), and
resurfacing techniques such as laser or
dermabrasion.
Topical therapies for squamous cell skin
cancer may cause burning, redness, itching,
and pain in the treated area. Sun-damaged
skin may also need to be re-treated with
topical therapies from time to time.

much normal tissue as possible. It should
be performed by surgeons who have special
training and experience in this procedure.
All forms of PDEMA allow for complete testing
of the edges of any removed tissue.

Standard surgical excision

Mohs surgery is the most common form of
PDEMA. Mohs surgery can be done in a
medical office or surgical suite and should be
done by a dermatologic (skin) surgeon who
has special training and experience in this
procedure. Most patients remain awake during
the procedure. After the area is numbed, the
visible tumor is first removed using a scalpel.
Next, a thin layer of surrounding tissue is
removed from under and around the wound.
The edges and underside of this tissue are
evaluated by the Mohs surgeon using a
microscope while you wait.

Standard surgical excision is another option for
treating squamous cell skin cancer. A standard
surgical excision (removal) can be done in a
medical office while you are awake. After the
area is numbed, the doctor removes the tumor
and an area of normal tissue surrounding
it with a scalpel blade. The edges of the
removed tissue are called the surgical margin.
PDEMA can also be used with standard
surgical excision. The tissue is then sent for
testing. A pathologist examines thin samples of

are cancer cells at the margin.

Wound healing after surgery

Lymph node dissection

After surgery, there are different ways a
wound can heal.

If lymph nodes near a squamous cell skin
cancer tumor are enlarged, the doctor might
biopsy them to check for cancer cells.

Some wounds heal better without stitches.
A wound might be left open (rather than
being stitched together) and left to heal
by itself, filling in and closing up naturally.
This is called secondary intention

regular dressings to the area for up to 6
weeks, but the full time to heal depends
on the size, depth, and area of the wound.

If the lymph node biopsy shows cancer,
sometimes many nodes might be removed in
a more extensive surgery called a lymph node
dissection. The nodes are then looked at under
a microscope for signs of cancer. This type of
surgery is more extensive than surgery on the
skin and is usually done while you are under
general anesthesia (in a deep sleep).

A linear closure is another common form
of wound healing. The surgeon will cut
a small amount of extra skin to change
the shape of the wound from a circle to a
fusiform (an oval that looks like a football)
to help the surgeon stitch the wound
together in a line.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy
A sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node
to which cancer cells most likely spread from a
primary tumor. Sometimes, there is more than
one sentinel lymph node.

Other wounds may need skin grafts
or other types of surgery (such as
rearranging skin, known as “flapping”)
to heal well and lessen scarring. A skin
graft is a patch of skin that is removed by
surgery from one area of the body and
transplanted (attached) to another area.
This may be done the same day or a few
days after a PDEMA/Mohs procedure or
standard surgical excision.

A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is
a surgery that removes tissue samples to
examine sentinel nodes. The lymph nodes will
be checked for cancer cells by a pathologist in
a lab. Sometimes people can have an SLNB at
the same time as surgery. The results will be
used to stage the cancer and plan treatment.
To locate the sentinel lymph node(s), your
surgeon will inject a radioactive, blue-colored
substance into your skin near the tumor. The
substance will drain into the sentinel lymph
nodes. Your surgeon will identify the sentinel
lymph nodes using a device and remove
them through a small cut in your skin. This
procedure is generally done under general
anesthesia.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Squamous Cell Skin Cancer, 2023

After surgery, your skin will continue
healing for a period of between 6 to 10
weeks. Scar treatment and aftercare for
the skin around the wound will likely be
recommended.

Types of treatments » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

have connective tissue diseases, such as
lupus or scleroderma.

Radiation therapy (RT) is a type of cancer
treatment that uses beams of intense energy –
from electrons (beams), photons (high-energy
x-rays), or protons (charged particles) -- to
kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy usually
involves 5 daily brief treatments per week over
3 to 7 weeks. Radiation treatments should be
given by a practicing radiation oncologist (a
doctor who is an expert in radiation treatment).

The same area generally should not be treated
with radiation more than once. When CSCC
grows in a radiated area, it usually needs to be
removed with surgery. However, the area often
doesn’t heal as well because the tissues were
weakened by the radiation. This is especially
true for CSCC on the scalp.
A radiation oncologist should help you
determine whether this treatment is
appropriate for you.

Types of radiation therapy
There are two general types of radiation
therapy that can be used to treat CSCC:
external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and
brachytherapy.

Adjuvant therapy refers to therapy that is given
after primary treatment to lower the risk that
cancer will come back. Radiation is sometimes
used as adjuvant therapy after surgery to kill
any remaining cancer cells, or to help prevent
recurrence for patients with high-risk tumors.

In EBRT, a beam of radiation is directed at the
tumor from a machine. The two most common
types of external beam radiation for CSCC are
electrons and photons. Electrons are used to
treat superficial tumors. Photons are used to
treat deeper, more invasive tumors.

Side effects of radiation therapy
The most common short-term side effects
of radiation are skin redness, itching, mild
discomfort, and feeling tired. These side
effects are worse at the end of the radiation
course and take several weeks to go away.

In brachytherapy, a radiation source is placed
close to or in direct contact with the tumor for a
short period of time.

Potential long-term side effects of radiation
include hardening of the skin and soft tissue
in the treatment area, mild change in skin
color (lightening or darkening), and spider
veins. More serious long-term side effects
include non-healing ulcers and cataracts (for
CSCC in the eye area). If you are treated with
radiation, you could develop a second cancer
in the treated area, but this is rare. This is
more common in young patients many years
(decades) later.

Uses for radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is an option for people after
resection (surgery) of their cancer, or for those
who cannot or choose not to have surgery.
However, radiation therapy can be very
effective for small tumors, and for tumors in
areas such as the head and neck.
Radiation therapy should not be used in
people who have certain genetic conditions
that put them at higher risk of skin cancer
caused by radiation, such as basal cell nevus
syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosum. It may
also not be appropriate for some people who

checkpoint inhibitor. Cemiplimab (Libtayo) and
pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are PD-1 inhibitors
used to treat squamous cell skin cancer and
other cancers.

Systemic therapy is treatment with medicine(s)
that travel in the bloodstream to reach cells
throughout the body. Systemic therapies can
affect both cancer cells and normal cells, and
they can have side effects. They are given
intravenously (through the veins) or taken by
mouth as a pill. Categories of systemic therapy
are described below.

Uses for systemic therapy
Systemic therapy is not often used by itself
to treat squamous cell skin cancer. It may be
used in combination with radiation therapy
to treat CSCC that can’t be removed using
surgery.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill fast-growing
cancer cells. Some chemotherapy medicines
contain the metal platinum. Cisplatin and
carboplatin are platinum chemotherapies used
to treat squamous cell skin cancer and other
cancers. They may be given in combination
with other chemotherapy drugs.

Systemic therapy alone may also be an option
if both surgery and radiation therapy are
not possible or were not successful. In this
case, immunotherapy with a PD-1 inhibitor is
preferred.

Targeted therapy

If you are prescribed systemic therapy, you
may experience side effects. The side effects
of systemic therapy vary greatly depending on
the medicine(s) used. Most side effects start
when treatment starts and stop when it’s over,
but some can occur months or even years
later. Common side effects include:

Side effects of systemic therapy

Targeted therapies are medicines that can
target and attack specific types of receptors
on cancer cells. The targeted therapies used
to treat squamous cell skin cancer are known
as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitors. EGFR is a protein found on the
surface of cells that causes them to divide.
Inhibiting (blocking) EGFR may keep cancer
cells from growing. Cetuximab (Erbitux) is an
EGFR inhibitor used to treat CSCC and other
cancers.

the immune system, which can improve the
body’s ability to find and destroy cancer cells.

Types of treatments » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in a
laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer
need to be studied in people. If found to be safe
and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device,
or treatment approach may be approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Phases

Start the conversation

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.







Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.

Frequently asked questions

Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways

Tumor shape

Tumor type

If the clinical extent (border) of the tumor is
well-defined, it is considered low risk. If the
border isn’t well-defined and has an uneven
shape, it is considered high risk.

To diagnose squamous cell skin cancer, you
likely had a small sample of tissue removed
for testing (a skin biopsy). That tissue sample
was then analyzed by a pathologist in order
to determine the specific type (and subtype)
of cancer. There are certain rare subtypes of
squamous cell skin cancer that are more likely
to return after treatment.

Tumor return after treatment
Recurrent tumors are cancer that has returned
after treatment, usually after a period of time
during which the cancer could not be detected.
All treatment types have a risk of recurrence.
The cancer may come back to the same place
as the original (primary) tumor or to another
place in the body. Any tumor that has returned
after treatment is considered a high-risk
squamous cell skin cancer.

Connective tissue in the tumor
Some tumors form fibrous or connective
tissue, which is a sign of a high-risk or very
high-risk cancer.

How deep the tumor is
The deeper the tumor has invaded into the
skin, the higher the risk of the cancer returning
after treatment or spreading to distant sites.

Tumor formed in damaged skin
If squamous cell skin cancer starts in an area
that was previously treated with radiation
therapy, it is considered a high-risk cancer. This
is also the case if the cancer starts in a wound,
a scar, or an area of damaged or inflamed skin.

Cancer cells in lymph or blood
vessels
If there are cancer cells in the blood vessels
or lymph vessels outside of the main tumor, it
means that the cancer is more likely to spread
to nearby lymph nodes and other parts of
the body. This is known as lymphovascular
invasion.

Nerve damage
If the tumor has grown into a nerve or group of
nerves, usually seen under a microscope, it is
considered a high-risk or very high-risk cancer.
This is also called perineural invasion. Signs
that the cancer may have invaded nerves
include pain, burning, stinging, loss of feeling or
movement, and double or blurred vision.

Weakened immune system
People with a weakened immune system
have a higher risk of getting CSCC, and
they are at higher risk of cancer returning
after treatment. Examples of conditions
that weaken the immune system include
long-term corticosteroid use, having human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS, or
having received an organ transplant.

Tumor grade
The tumor grade is a rating of how fast your
doctors expect the cancer to grow and spread.
It is based on how different the tumor cells look
compared to normal cells under a microscope.
The more different they look, the higher the
risk of spreading.

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit

Curettage and electrodesiccation

If you smoke tobacco or use e-cigarettes,
it is very important to quit. Smoking can
limit how well cancer treatment works.
Smoking greatly increases your chances
of having side effects during and after
surgery. It also increases your chances of
developing other cancers.

C&E or shave excision are recommended
treatment options for low-risk, local CSCC.
Usually it is considered for early, small CSCC
on the surface of the skin. If the tumor ends
up being deeper than expected into the skin
during the procedure, a standard surgical or
shave excision should be performed rather
than C&E to remove deep areas of cancerous
tissue.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco
that makes you want to keep smoking.
Nicotine withdrawal is challenging for
most smokers. The stress of having
cancer may make it even harder to quit.
If you smoke, ask your doctor about
counseling and medicines that can help
you quit.

Standard surgical excision
Standard surgical excision is a recommended
treatment option for low-risk, local CSCC. If
testing after surgery finds cancer cells in the
surrounding tissue removed with the tumor,
more treatment is needed. Further treatment

Standard surgical excision
Standard surgical excision is a recommended
treatment option for high-risk or very high-risk
local CSCC. A wider margin (area of normal
tissue around the lesion) is removed for highrisk or very high-risk CSCC.

Mohs surgery or another form of
PDEMA
Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA is the
preferred treatment option for very high-risk
cancer that has not spread to lymph nodes.
Before or during PDEMA, your doctor may
consider a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).
An SLNB is used to identify the first lymph
nodes where cancer might have spread. The
surgeon uses a harmless dye and a low-level
radioactive solution to find the sentinel nodes.
The nodes are then removed and tested for
signs of cancer.

If standard surgical excision is successful at
removing the cancer but other concerning
features are noted during surgery, a discussion
with different cancer doctors is recommended
to determine next steps. Treatment with
radiation therapy will be considered.
If testing after surgery finds cancer in the
margin, more treatment is needed. If Mohs
surgery or another form of PDEMA is
possible, it is usually tried first. Otherwise,
another standard surgical excision is typically
performed.

If Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA

Treatment

Tumors on other areas of the
body

Surgery is recommended to treat squamous
cell skin cancer that has spread to nearby
lymph nodes. Surgery for regional CSCC
involves excision (removal) of the cancerous
lesion and nearby lymph nodes. Although
surgery is preferred, it may not be an option
for one or more reasons. In this case, see
If surgery is not an option below for
information.

Surgery is the best way to treat tumors that
have spread to other areas of the body if
possible. Surgery removes the tumor and
nearby lymph nodes. Radiation therapy may
be given after surgery to kill leftover cancer
cells. This is important if there was more than
one lymph node with cancer, or if cancer was
found to have grown through the protective
outer layer of any lymph nodes removed
during surgery.

If surgery is very risky or might not completely
remove your cancer, your doctor may suggest
immunotherapy with cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo)
first. It may shrink the tumor and make surgery
less risky.

If surgery is not an option
If you cannot have surgery, a discussion
between different cancer doctors to consider
your treatment options is recommended. If you
can have it, radiation therapy with or without
systemic therapy is recommended. Platinumbased chemotherapy is a recommended option
for use with radiation.

Head and neck tumors
Lymph nodes may be removed from one
or both sides of the neck during surgery for
head and neck tumors. The extent of surgery
depends on the number, location, and size of
the lymph nodes with cancer. After surgery,
radiation therapy is often given to decrease the
chance of the tumor returning.

Lymph nodes with cancer were not

If radiation therapy is not expected to kill
the cancer completely or may damage
healthy organs, systemic therapy alone
is recommended. If you are eligible,
immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint

may also be an option. A clinical trial could
involve treatment with chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, or immunotherapy.

Cancer was found to have grown through
the protective outer layer of any lymph
nodes removed during surgery (called
extracapsular or extranodal extension)

If you are not eligible for an immune
checkpoint inhibitor or a clinical trial, options
for systemic therapy include platinum-based
chemotherapy and targeted therapy.

In either of these situations, a discussion
between different cancer doctors is
recommended. If systemic therapy is planned,
platinum-based chemotherapy is preferred for
use with radiation if you can have it.

Metastatic squamous cell
skin cancer

Key points


Cancer cells can spread through blood and
lymph to form tumors in other areas of the
body. This is called metastasis. Squamous cell
skin cancer does not metastasize often. For
this reason, there is not much research on the
best way to treat metastatic squamous cell
skin cancer. A discussion between different
cancer doctors is recommended to consider
your treatment options.





If surgery and/or radiation therapy cannot
remove metastatic CSCC, systemic therapy
is recommended. If you are eligible,
immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint
inhibitor is preferred. Enrolling in a clinical
trial for systemic therapy is another option.
A clinical trial could involve treatment
with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or
immunotherapy.







If you are not eligible for an immune
checkpoint inhibitor or a clinical trial, options
for systemic therapy include platinum-based
chemotherapy and targeted therapy.



Help for symptoms
Radiation therapy and/or surgery may be used
to treat distant tumors that are causing pain
or other bothersome side effects. Stereotactic
body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a special
radiation technique that may be used in some
cases. It sends high doses of radiation to small
areas to kill cancer cells and is typically given
over 3 to 5 treatments.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Squamous Cell Skin Cancer, 2023

Squamous cell skin cancer that has
spread to nearby lymph nodes is called
“regional”.
Your care team will test suspicious lymph
nodes to determine how far the disease
has spread.
Testing could also include scans of your
upper body, stomach, and pelvis to check
for any metastatic disease (spread) to
those areas.
The best way to treat regional CSCC is
with surgery to remove the tumor and
nearby lymph nodes.
Radiation therapy with or without systemic
therapy is often given after surgery to kill
leftover cancer cells.
If surgery is not possible or not
recommended, radiation therapy,
systemic therapy, or a combination of
both may be options.
If radiation therapy is not expected to
kill the cancer completely or may harm
critical healthy organs, systemic therapy
alone is recommended.
Although it is uncommon, squamous cell
skin cancer can metastasize. Metastatic
CSCC that cannot be removed with
surgery and/or radiation is treated with
systemic therapy.
Systemic therapy options for metastatic
CSCC include immunotherapy or a
systemic therapy given in a clinical trial.
If you are not a candidate for either of
these, your doctor may recommend
platinum-based chemotherapy or targeted
therapy.

are at higher risk of getting it
again. You’re also at higher risk of
getting other types of skin cancer.

For local CSCC, monitoring during the first 2
years after treatment is the most important.
Exams should occur at least every 3 to 12
months (for patients who are low risk) or
every 3 to 6 months (for patients who are high
risk) during this time. If no further skin cancer
develops in the first 2 years, then exams are
spaced out to every 6 to 12 months (once or
twice a year) for another 3 years. After that,
having an exam once a year for the rest of
your life is recommended by NCCN experts.

Some medicines used to help stop squamous
cell skin cancer from forming are described
next.

Treating squamous cell skin cancer when
it first appears can help prevent the cancer
from growing into deeper layers of the skin. In
people who form CSCCs very easily, however,
treatment alone may not be the best strategy.
Rather than wait for the cancer to form, there
are ways to help prevent squamous cell skin
cancer if you are considered at high risk.

Oral retinoids
When taken by mouth (orally), drugs called
retinoids can help prevent squamous cell
carcinoma from forming in people who form
actinic keratoses easily. Acitretin (Soriatane)
and isotretinoin are two retinoids used for this
purpose.
Oral retinoids can cause drying or chapping
of the lips, peeling of the skin, hair disorders,
and more extreme side effects. They can also
cause birth defects, and should therefore be
used with extreme caution in people who could
become pregnant. People taking these drugs
need to have their blood tested on a regular
basis.

Dermatology checks
Following up with a dermatologist for checkups
is strongly recommended if you have any of
the following conditions:






Past or current solid organ, marrow, or
stem cell transplant

Oral nicotinamide
Nicotinamide is a form of niacin (vitamin
B3). Nicotinamide supplements are used to
treat skin conditions and niacin deficiencies.
Nicotinamide may help prevent squamous cell
carcinoma from returning after treatment and
from spreading to distant sites in people at
high risk.

One or more cutaneous melanomas
within the past 5 years
Four or more nonmelanoma skin cancers
in the past 5 years

Medication
Studies where medications were given to
help prevent squamous cell skin cancer from
forming have been shown to help:









To prevent squamous cell skin cancer,
nicotinamide is taken orally (by mouth) twice a
day. No prescription is needed for nicotinamide
and it is considered safe.

People who had an organ transplant
People who have genetic syndromes that
make them more likely to develop CSCCs

Nicotinamide can also be made in the body by
eating niacin-rich foods such as fish, chicken
or other poultry, nuts, legumes (beans), eggs,
and cereal grains.

People who have psoriasis who have had
psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy
People who have had squamous cell skin
cancer more than once
People who have large areas of actinic
keratosis

When treatment is over » Steps you can take

Steps you can take

Staying inside or in the shade during peak
daylight hours is another way to protect your
skin. You should never use tanning booths
or beds. Your goal is to never get another
sunburn or suntan.

Your care team should provide you with
information about how you can play a role in
preventing new skin cancers from forming.
The information should cover two important
topics—sun protection and skin self-exams.

Skin self-exams

Sun protection

Your doctor should also teach you how to
examine your skin yourself for signs of cancer.
Following the same process each time can
make it easier to notice any changes from the
last time you checked. A handheld mirror is
helpful for seeing hard-to-reach areas. You
may also ask a spouse or friend to help you do
the exam.

Protecting your skin from the sun is an
important part of preventing future squamous
cell carcinomas. One of the best ways to do
this is to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with
a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher.
When spending time outside, sunscreen
should be reapplied to all exposed areas
every 2 hours, or after swimming or sweating.
Consider also using a face moisturizer with a
SPF of 30 or higher on a daily basis.

Ideally, you should do a self-exam once a
month. If you had regional CSCC, meaning
that the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes,
your doctor should also teach you how to
inspect your lymph nodes for signs of cancer.

Physically shielding your skin from the sun with
hats and clothing can help protect it. Similar
to SPF ratings for sunscreen, clothing with
an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rating is
available. The higher the UPF rating, the better
the sun protection.

Sun protection
When spending time outside,
apply a sunscreen with SPF
30 or higher. Sunscreen
should be reapplied to all
exposed areas every 2
hours, or after swimming or
sweating. Consider using a
face moisturizer with SPF 30 or
higher on a daily basis.

After treatment for CSCC, it’s important to
have your skin examined by your doctor
on a regular basis. How often exams are
needed depends on whether cancer has
spread to nearby lymph nodes.

Should I be concerned about
getting more CSCCs?

People at high risk of getting squamous
cell skin cancer may benefit from
medicines or topical treatments that can
help prevent skin cancers from forming.

Out of 100 people who have had
squamous cell skin cancer, about 40
(40%) will get a new CSCC within 5 years-and most will get one within 2 years. For
this reason, monitoring during the first 2
years after treatment is very important.

Using broad-spectrum sunscreen daily,
wearing protective clothing, and staying
out of the sun are steps you can take
to help prevent new skin cancers from
forming.

NCCN experts recommend having regular
skin exams by your doctor, doing your
own skin self-exams, and protecting your
skin from the sun and UV rays.

In addition to skin checks by your doctor,
patients should examine their skin
themselves for signs of skin cancer on
a regular basis. Patients with regional
CSCC should also examine their lymph
nodes.

Skin self-exams
In addition to getting full
skin exams by your doctor,
examining your skin yourself
on a regular basis can help
spot the return of cancer and
help find new cancers early.
