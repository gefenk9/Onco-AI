About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Breast Cancer, Version 2.2024 – March 11, 2024.

1 Breast cancer basics » The breast

Metastatic breast cancer is breast

Breast tissue contains glands that can make
milk. These milk glands are called lobules.
Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small
tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the
nipple.

cancer that has spread to other
parts of the body. Metastatic
breast cancer is also called
advanced breast cancer.

The ring of darker breast skin is called the
areola. The raised tip within the areola is called
the nipple. The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is
a term that refers to both parts.

The breast

Lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph
vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your
armpit (axilla). Lymph is a clear fluid that
gives cells water and food. It also helps to
fight germs. Nodes near the armpit are called
axillary lymph nodes (ALNs).

The breast is an organ and a gland found on
the chest. The breast is made of milk ducts
and lobules, fat, nerves, lymph and blood
vessels, ligaments, and other connective
tissue. Behind the breast is the pectoral (chest)
muscle and ribs. Muscle and ligaments help
hold the breast in place.

The breast is a glandular
organ made up of milk

1 Breast cancer basics » Breast cancer » How breast cancer spreads

Breast cancer

Metastasis
Unlike normal cells, cancer cells can spread
and form tumors in other parts of the body
called metastases. In this process, cancer
cells break away from the first (primary) tumor
and travel through blood or lymph vessels to
distant sites. Once in other sites, cancer cells
may form secondary tumors. Since cancer
cells can spread through the blood, it is still
possible to develop metastases even when the
axillary lymph nodes are negative for cancer.

Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast.
Almost all breast cancers are a subtype called
carcinomas. Carcinomas are cancers that
start in the cells that line the inner or outer
surfaces of the body. There are different types
of breast carcinoma, most of which arise in
cells that make up the lining (epithelial cells)
in the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of
the breast. The most common types are either
ductal or lobular.



Anyone can develop breast cancer, including
those assigned male at birth. Although there
are some differences between those assigned
male and those assigned female at birth,
treatment is very similar for all genders.



How breast cancer spreads

Cancer that has spread to a body part far
from the primary tumor is called a distant
metastasis.

Breast cancer can metastasize almost
anywhere but most commonly spreads to the
bone (including spine), lungs, liver, brain, or
distant lymph nodes. Breast cancer that has
metastasized to other parts of the body is still
called breast cancer.

Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells.
Cancer cells differ from normal cells in the
following ways.

Primary tumor
Over time, cancer cells form a mass called a
primary tumor.

More information on invasive breast cancer is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Invasive
Cancer cells can grow into surrounding
tissues. Invasive breast cancer is breast
cancer that has spread from the milk ducts
or milk glands (lobules) into the surrounding
breast tissue or nearby lymph nodes.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Breast Cancer, 2024

Cancer that has spread to a nearby body
part such as the axillary lymph nodes
is called a local metastasis. It might be
referred to as locoregional disease or
locally advanced.

Anyone can develop breast cancer, but
breast cancer occurs more frequently in
persons assigned female at birth.
Inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat,
blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and
connective tissue. Lobules are structures
that make breast milk. Ducts carry breast
milk from the lobules to the nipple.

Breast cancer arises from epithelial cells
(cells that make up the lining) in the
terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of the
breast and then spreads into surrounding
tissue.

NCCN.org/patients/response

Invasive breast cancer has grown outside
the ducts or lobules into surrounding
tissue. Once outside the ducts or lobules,
breast cancer can spread through lymph
or blood to lymph nodes or other parts of
the body.
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has
spread outside the breast and lymph
nodes. It is possible to have MBC when
axillary lymph nodes do not have cancer.

gather information about the
cancer you have. This chapter
presents an overview of the tests
you might receive and what to
expect.



Test results


Results from imaging studies and biopsy will
be used to determine your treatment plan. The
biopsy sample will be tested for estrogen and
progesterone hormone receptors and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
receptors. Treatment will be based on these
findings.
It is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions about your test results.





Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment. This can
be different people for different tasks or
change over time.

Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible, or have someone on the phone
or join you for telehealth visits.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to

Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have. Your test results and
visit notes are likely available through a
patient portal. Signing up for this portal
can be one way to review those results
and notes, too.
Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on
your computer, phone, or other electronic
device.
Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.
They are great partners in your care.
In your contact list, include information on
the exact type of cancer you have, as well
as any treatments you've received and
the date each treatment started.
Set up a MyChart or health record
account if it’s available, which can
help you track your appointments and
communicate with your care team.
Remember that in many places the
MyChart or portal messages are not
immediately seen by a nurse or physician,
so urgent concerns are best called to
the triage phone number. Ask your care
team to learn more about how best to
communicate with them.

2 Testing for MBC » General health tests

For possible tests, see Guide 1.

Family history
Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your care team will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history. Ask all family members about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific
type of cancer, or where the cancer started, if it
is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic
testing.

General health tests
Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
(OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you
take. Some supplements interact and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam
of the bare breast performed by a health care
provider to check for lumps or other changes.
It is done while you are seated and/or lying
down. Your provider should take time to
palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the
armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in
the room during the exam.

Fertility (all genders)

Preventing pregnancy during
treatment

Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect
your fertility, the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might change your fertility. To preserve your
fertility, you may need to take action before
starting cancer treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options
before starting treatment.

Cancer and cancer treatment can affect the
ovaries and damage sperm. If you become
pregnant during chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or other types of systemic therapy,
serious birth defects can occur. Speak with
your care team about preventing pregnancy
while being treated for cancer. Hormonal birth
control may or may not be recommended,
so ask your doctor about options such as
intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier
methods. Types of barrier methods include
condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the
contraceptive sponge.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t sure at the
moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists
can help you sort through what may be best for
your situation.

Those with ovaries
Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing
baby if you are or become pregnant during
treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding at the time of your cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.

More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
period may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment. It is still
possible to become pregnant even though
you might not have a period. Therefore, birth
control is recommended during and after
treatment. Consult your doctor for the best
time to plan a pregnancy.

Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

2 Testing for MBC » Blood tests

Those with testicles

Testing takes time. It might take
days or weeks for all test results
to come in.

Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth
control) such as condoms to prevent
pregnancy during and immediately after cancer
treatment.

Blood tests

Liver function tests
Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that are
made or processed by the liver. Levels that
are too high or low signal that the liver is not
working well or that cancer has spread to the
liver.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein.

Alkaline phosphatase

Pregnancy test

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme
found in the blood. High levels of ALP can be a
sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver. A
bone scan might be performed if you have high
levels of ALP.

Those who can become pregnant will be given
a pregnancy test before treatment begins.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures
the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in
your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells fight
infection, and platelets control bleeding.

Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures 14 different substances in your
blood. It is usually done on the plasma part
of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.

2 Testing for MBC » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

your bones hurt or were abnormal on a bone
scan.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Imaging tests show the primary
tumor, or where the cancer started, and look
for cancer in other parts of the body. Tests are
based on if metastatic disease is suspected
and any symptoms you might have. You will
not have all these tests listed in this section.

Contrast material
Contrast materials are not dyes, but
substances that help make the pictures of the
inside of the body clearer. The contrast is not
permanent and will leave the body in your
urine after the test. There is more than one
type of contrast and it differs depending on
the test. Tell your care team if you have had
allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This
is important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies.

A radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report to
your health care provider (HCP). It is likely that
the report will be sent directly to you through
your patient portal or patient access system.
You should discuss these results with your
HCP.

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your chest,
abdomen, and/or pelvis might be one of the
tests used to look for cancer. Intravenous (IV)
contrast is often used.

Bone scan
A bone scan uses a radiotracer. A radiotracer
is a substance that releases small amounts of
radiation. Before the pictures are taken, the
tracer will be injected into your vein. It can take
a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones.
A special camera will take pictures of the
tracer in your bones as it moves over your
body. Areas of bone damage take up more
radiotracer than healthy bone and show up
as bright spots on the pictures. Bone damage
can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment,
previous injuries, or other health issues.

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

Bone x-ray
An x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one
picture at a time. A tumor changes the way
radiation is absorbed and will show up on the
x-ray. X-rays are also good at showing bone
issues. Your care team may order x-rays if

2 Testing for MBC » Imaging tests

Types of PET/CT scans include:

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.






A breast MRI might be used in addition
to a mammogram. Contrast should be
used. You will be positioned face down in
the machine with your arms above your
head.



A spine or brain MRI can be used
to detect breast cancer that has spread
(metastasized) to your spine or brain. For
a brain MRI, a device is placed around
your head. For a spine MRI, no device is
worn. Contrast should be used in an MRI.



PET scan

An FES-PET/CT might be used instead
of FDG-PET/CT when cancer is estrogen
receptor-positive (ER+). FES is a
radioactive form of the hormone estrogen.
A sodium fluoride PET/CT might be
used instead of a bone scan. In this test,
the radiotracer is made of sodium fluoride.

Ultrasound

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans. However, not all tumors will
appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright
spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain,
heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on
PET. Inflammation or infection can also show
up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Breast Cancer, 2024

An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer
called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is
made of fluoride and a simple form of
sugar called glucose. You cannot eat or
drink for at least 4 hours before the scan.
This scan is most helpful when other
imaging results are unclear. It may help
find cancer in lymph nodes and distant
sites. If it clearly shows cancer in the
bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride
PET/CT may not be needed.

An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer) will
be held and moved on your bare breast using
gel. It may also be placed below your armpit.
Ultrasound does not use x-rays. It is good at
showing small areas of cancer that are near
the skin. Sometimes, a breast ultrasound or
MRI is used to guide a biopsy.

15

2 Testing for MBC » Biopsy

Biopsy

Since your type of breast cancer
may change over time, a repeat
biopsy may be needed to guide
treatment.

A biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample
of tissue or fluid. The sample is sent to a lab for
testing. A pathologist will examine the biopsy
for cancer and write a report called a pathology
report. Ask questions about your biopsy results
and what it means for your treatment.

The needle is often guided into the tumor with
imaging. When mammography is used during
a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle
biopsy.

There are different types of biopsies. Some
biopsies are guided using imaging, such
as ultrasound or MRI. If metastatic disease
is suspected, one or more tumors will be
biopsied to confirm disease and help guide
treatment. You may have tissue removed from
the breast, lymph nodes, or other areas of the
body affected by cancer.

There are both physical and emotional
experiences in having biopsies. You may need
to rest and place an ice pack on the biopsy
area after the procedure. If you are working
or have other commitments, you may want to
take the day off to rest.

Types of possible biopsies include:






Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core
biopsy (CB) uses needles of different
sizes to remove a sample of tissue or
fluid. In a vacuum-assisted core biopsy
(VACB), suction is used to remove the
sample with a special vacuum device.

Biopsy of metastasis
Metastasis is the spread of cancer to an area
of the body such as the bones, lungs, or liver.
A biopsy of the metastasis is typically needed
to confirm the presence of cancer. If there is
more than one metastasis, more than one
site may be biopsied. The type of biopsy used
depends on the location of the suspected
metastases and other factors. These biopsies
are usually guided by imaging tests like
ultrasound (US) or CT.

Incisional biopsy removes a small
amount of tissue through a small cut in
the skin or body.
Excisional biopsy removes the entire
abnormal area. This is not the preferred
type of biopsy but may be necessary
if other methods are not possible or
when the biopsy results don’t match the
expected findings.

Biopsy results
Histology is the study of the anatomy
(structure) of cells, tissues, and organs
under a microscope. It is used to make
treatment decisions. Your pathology report will
contain information about histology, such as
invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular
carcinoma.

Before biopsies are performed, the area is
usually injected with numbing medicine. A core
needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one
tissue sample, but usually through the same
area on the breast. The samples are small.

2 Testing for MBC » Hormone receptor status

Hormone receptor status

Estrogen receptor-positive
(ER+) breast cancer cells

Your blood carries hormones throughout your
body. A hormone is a substance made by a
gland in your body. A receptor is a protein
found inside or on the surface of a cell. When
hormones attach (bind) to specific receptors, it
causes changes within the cell.

3 In ER+ breast cancer, testing finds

estrogen hormone receptors in at
least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells.

3 In ER-low–positive invasive breast

When hormones attach to receptors inside
breast cancer cells, they can cause cancer
to grow. If found, these receptors may be
targeted using endocrine therapy.

cancer, testing finds estrogen
hormone receptors in 1 to 10 out of
every 100 cancer cells.

3 Endocrine therapy might not be

recommended for ER-low–positive
invasive breast cancer.

There are 2 types of hormone receptors:




Estrogen – plays a role in breast
development
Progesterone – plays a role in
menstrual cycle and pregnancy

Hormone receptor-positive
In hormone receptor-positive (HR+)
breast cancer, IHC finds estrogen and/or
progesterone hormone receptors. Most breast
cancers are HR+.

Hormone receptor (HR) testing should be done
on any new tumors. A biopsy sample will be
used.



Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to cells. These cells are then
studied using a microscope. IHC can find
estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors
in breast cancer cells. A pathologist will
measure how many cells have estrogen and/
or progesterone receptors and the number of
receptors inside each cell.



Estrogen receptor (ER) is stimulated
by estrogen and provides survival and
proliferation (rapid growth) signals.
Cancer cells deprived of estrogen or
that have their ER signal blocked with
treatment may stop growing or die.
Progesterone receptor (PR) binds
progesterone and provides survival and
proliferation signals. It is thought that PR
expression also suggests the tumor is
estrogen dependent.

HR+ breast cancer is treated with endocrine
therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor
signaling or decreases estrogen production.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Breast Cancer, 2024

2 Testing for MBC » HER2 status » Biomarker testing

Hormone receptor-negative

of HER2 expression (1+ and 2+ by IHC) called
HER2-low.

Hormone receptor-negative (HR-) breast
cancer cells do not have estrogen or
progesterone hormone receptors. These
cancers are sometimes simply called hormone
negative. HR- cancers often grow faster
than HR+ cancers. Both the estrogen and
progesterone receptors need to be negative for
breast cancer to be considered HR-.

FISH/ISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or
other ISH methods like dual ISH are testing
methods that involve special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA, the
genetic material in a person’s cells.

HER2 status

Biomarker testing

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. It is found on the surface of all cells.
When amounts are high, it causes cells to
grow and divide. Some breast cancers have
too many HER2 genes or receptors. Too many
HER2s is called HER2-positive (HER2+). You
might hear it called HER2 overexpression or
amplification.

A sample from a biopsy of your tumor
may be tested to look for specific DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations,
protein levels, or other molecular features.
This information is used to choose the best
treatment for you. It is sometimes called
molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor
sequencing, gene expression profiling, or
genomic testing.

There are 2 tests for HER2:




Biomarker testing includes tests of genes
or their products (proteins). It identifies
the presence or absence of mutations and
certain proteins that might suggest treatment.
Proteins are written like this: BRCA. Genes are
written with italics like this: BRCA. HER2 and
hormone receptor status are part of biomarker
testing. Your treatment team will recommend
the best types of biomarker testing that are
important for you.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
measures receptors. If the IHC score is
3+, the cancer is HER2+. If the score is 0
or 1, it is considered HER2-. If the score
is 2+, further testing is needed.
In situ hybridization (ISH) counts the
number of copies of the HER2 gene. This
test is done mainly when the IHC score is
unclear.

Tumor mutation testing

HER2 testing should be done on all new
tumors. A tumor biopsy sample will be used.
You might have more than one HER2 test.
Newer drugs that target HER2 have recently
been shown to be effective in some people
with metastatic breast cancer with lower levels
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Breast Cancer, 2024

Tumor mutation testing or tumor genomic
aberration testing uses a sample of your tumor
or blood to see if the cancer cells have any
specific DNA mutations. This is a different type
of DNA testing than the genetic testing for
18

2 Testing for MBC » Biomarker testing

MSI-H/dMMR mutation

mutations you may have inherited from your
parents. In tumor mutation testing, only the
tumor is tested and not the rest of your body.

Microsatellites are short, repeated strings
of DNA. When errors or defects occur,
they are fixed by mismatch repair (MMR)
proteins. Some cancers have DNA mutations
or changes that prevent these errors from
being fixed. This is called microsatellite
instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair
(dMMR). When cancer cells have more than
a normal number of microsatellites, it is called
MSI-H (microsatellite instability-high). This is
often due to dMMR genes.

Testing is done using a variety of methods
such as FISH, ISH, IHC, next-generation
sequencing (NGS), and/or polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). These methods are used
to identify the presence of gene mutations,
alterations, rearrangements, or fusions.




Certain mutations such as PIK3CA, AKT1,
PTEN, ESR1, NTRK, and RET can be
targeted with specific therapies. Testing
for ESR1 and RET mutations is done on
hormone receptor-positive tumors.

Tumor mutational burden
When there are 10 or more mutations per
million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H).
TMB-H can be used to help predict response
to cancer treatment using immune checkpoint
inhibitors that target the proteins PD-1 and
PD-L1.

Germline BRCA1/2 testing is
recommended for all patients with
metastatic breast cancer, unless it has
already been done (more recently than
2014).

PD-1 and PD-L1 testing

Next-generation sequencing

Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) are
immune proteins. If either protein is expressed
on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause
your immune cells to ignore the cancer and
suppress the anti-tumor immune response.
If your cancer expresses either protein,
you might have treatment that combines
chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor
therapy. This is designed to activate your
immune system to better fight off the cancer
cells. Usually this test is done when hormone
receptors and HER2 testing are negative (like
in triple-negative tumors).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Breast Cancer, 2024

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a highthroughput method used to determine the DNA
sequence or gene changes of cancer cells in
your tumor. This method would only be used
if enough tumor tissue remains after other
biomarker testing has been completed.

PCR
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions of
copies of your DNA (genetic information). PCR
is very sensitive. It can find 1 abnormal cell
among more than 100,000 normal cells. These
copies called PCR product might be used for
NGS.

19

2 Testing for MBC » Biomarker testing

NTRK gene fusions
In a tumor with an NTRK gene fusion, a piece
of the NTRK gene and a piece of another
gene fuse or join. This activates the NTRK
gene in a way that causes uncontrolled cell
growth. Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) and entrectinib
(Rozlytrek) might be used to target advanced
or metastatic HR+/HER2- cancer that is NTRK
gene fusion-positive. NTRK gene fusions are
rare.

What is your family
health history?
Some cancers and other diseases run in
families—those who are related to you
through genes passed down from biological
parent to child. This information is called
a family health history. Ask blood relatives
about their health issues like heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they
were diagnosed. For relatives who were
diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or other
relatives if they are no longer living) what
type of cancer they had, if they died from
the cancer, and at what age the cancer was
diagnosed.

RET gene fusions
A RET gene mutation is related to cell growth
(proliferation). Selpercatinib (Retevmo) might
be used to target advanced or metastatic HR+
with HER2- tumors with a RET fusion.

Tumor markers
Your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested for
proteins called tumor markers. Knowing this
information can help plan treatment. Examples
of some tumor markers in breast cancer
include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA
15-3, and CA 27.29. An increase in the level
of certain tumor markers could mean that the
cancer has grown or spread (progressed).
However, not everyone has elevated levels
of these markers and tumor markers alone
are not a reliable method of detecting breast
cancer.

Start by asking your parents, siblings,
and children. Next, talk to half-siblings,
aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews,
grandparents, and grandchildren.
Write down what you learn about your
family history and share this information
with your health care provider.
Some of the questions to ask include:

3 How old were you when each of these
diseases and health conditions was
diagnosed?

Liquid biopsy

3 What is our family’s ancestry—from

Some abnormal changes (mutations) can be
found by testing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
in the blood. In a liquid biopsy, a sample of
blood is taken to look for cancer cells or for
pieces of DNA from tumor cells. Sometimes,
testing can quickly use up a tumor sample and
a liquid biopsy might be an option in this case.

mutates, it no longer works correctly. Those
with a PALB2 mutation have a higher risk of
developing breast cancer.

About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are
hereditary. Depending on your family history or
other features of your cancer, your health care
provider might refer you for hereditary genetic
testing to learn more about your cancer. A
genetic counselor or trained provider will speak
to you about the results. Test results may be
used to guide treatment planning.

Distress screening
It is normal to have strong feelings about being
diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can
also change from day to day and week to
week. Talk to your care team and those whom
you feel most comfortable about how you are
feeling. There are services and people who
can help you. Support and counseling are
available. Many treatment teams include mind
and body therapists who can help.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
from spitting into a cup or a cheek swab. The
goal is to look for gene mutations inherited
from your biological parents called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You
can pass these genes on to your children.
Also, other blood relatives might carry these
mutations. Tell your care team if there is a
family history of cancer.

Dealing with a cancer diagnosis can be
stressful and may cause further distress.
Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You
may also experience depression, anxiety, and
sleep issues. Your treatment team will screen
your level of distress. This is part of your
cancer care.

BRCA tests
Everyone has BRCA genes. Normal BRCA
genes help to prevent tumor growth. They
help fix damaged cells and help cells grow
normally. BRCA mutations put you at risk for
more than one type of cancer. Mutations in
BRCA1 or BRCA2 increase the risk of breast,
ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma
skin cancers. Mutated BRCA genes can also
affect how well some treatments work. These
tests might be repeated if you were tested over
10 years ago (technology has changed since
2014).

Your cancer diagnosis may affect your family
or loved ones. They may feel some degree of
anxiety or depression. They can talk to a social
worker and seek help, too.
More information on distress is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Other genes
Other genes such as PALB2, p53, CHEK2,
and ATM might be tested. For example, PALB2
normally helps prevent cancer. When PALB2

PS 2 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed less than half of the time and
still able to care for self.
PS 3 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed more than half of the time.

Tests are used to find cancer, plan
treatment, and check how well treatment
is working.
You will have a physical exam, including
a breast exam, to see if anything feels or
looks abnormal.
Treatment can affect your fertility, the
ability to have children.
During a biopsy, tissue or fluid samples
are removed for testing. Samples are
needed to confirm the presence of cancer
and to perform cancer cell tests.
A sample from a biopsy of your tumor
will be tested for estrogen receptor (ER)
status, progesterone receptor (PR) status,
HER2 status, grade, and histology. This
provides information about the behavior
of your cancer, as well as treatments to
which your cancer may respond.
About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are





How breast cancer is
staged



A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging.





Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A
prognosis is the course your cancer will likely
take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Breast Cancer, 2024

The extent (size) of the tumor (T):
How large is the cancer? Has it grown
into nearby areas?
The spread to nearby lymph nodes
(N): Has the cancer spread to nearby
lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where?
The spread (metastasis) to distant
sites (M): Has the cancer spread to
distant organs such as the lungs or liver?
Estrogen receptor (ER) status: Does
the cancer have the protein called an
estrogen receptor?
Progesterone receptor (PR) status:
Does the cancer have the protein called a
progesterone receptor?
Human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) status: Does the
cancer make too much of a protein called
HER2?
Grade of the cancer (G): How much
do the cancer cells look like normal cells?
Biomarker testing: Does the cancer
have any genes, proteins, markers, or
mutations that might suggest treatment?

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
It takes into account what can be felt during a
physical exam, what can be seen on imaging
tests, and what is found during a biopsy or
surgery. Often, not all information is available
at the initial evaluation. More information can
be gathered as treatment begins.

3 Breast cancer staging » TNM scores

Staging includes:




Anatomic – based on extent of cancer
as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node
status (N), and distant metastasis (M).

Treatment options by
cell receptor type

Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM
plus tumor grade and the status of the
biomarkers such as HER2, ER, and
PR. Prognostic stage also includes the
assumption that you are treated with the
standard-of-care approaches.

There are many treatments for metastatic
breast cancer. Which ones are right for you
are based on many factors. Two important
factors are the hormone receptor (HR) and
HER2 status of any tumors.
Hormone receptors include estrogen
and progesterone. A tumor is considered
hormone receptor-positive (HR+) if an
increased number of estrogen receptors,
progesterone receptors, or both are found.

TNM scores
The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage breast cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different areas
of cancer growth. Based on cancer test results,
a score or number is assigned to each letter.
The higher the number, the larger the tumor or
the more the cancer has spread. These scores
will be combined to assign the cancer a stage.
A TNM example might look like this: T2N1M0
or T2, N1, M0.






HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. There might be higher amounts of
HER2 in your breast cancer. If this is the
case, it is called HER2-positive (HER2+)
breast cancer.

3 Breast cancer staging » TNM scores

T = Tumor

N = Regional lymph node

The primary tumor size can be measured in
centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). One
inch is equal to 2.54 cm. A large pea is 1 cm
(10 mm). A golf ball is 4 cm (40 mm). A tumor
micrometastasis is a very small collection of
cancerous cells smaller than 1 mm. It might be
written as T1mi. Ipsilateral means on the same
side of the body.

Lymph, a clear fluid containing cells that help
fight infections and other diseases, drains
through channels into lymphatic vessels. From
here, lymph drains into lymph nodes. Lymph
nodes work as filters to help fight infection.



Regional lymph nodes are those located
near the breast in the armpit (axilla). If breast
cancer spreads, it often goes first to nearby
lymph nodes under the arm. It can also
sometimes spread to lymph nodes near the
collarbone or near the breastbone. However,
it is possible for cancerous cells to travel
through lymph and blood to other parts of the
body without having gone to the lymph nodes
first. Knowing if the cancer has spread to your
lymph nodes helps doctors find the best way to
treat your cancer.

T1 Tumor is 2 cm (20 mm) or less
•

T1mi Tumor is micrometastasis of 1
mm or less

•

T1a Tumor is 1.1 mm to 5 mm

•

T1b Tumor is 5.1 mm to 10 mm

•

T1c Tumor is 10.1 mm to 20 mm

•

T2 Tumor is 2.1 cm to 5 cm







T3 Tumor is more than 5 cm
T4 Tumor is of any size and has invaded
nearby structures such as the chest wall
and skin of the breast

N0 means no cancer is in the regional
lymph nodes. Isolated tumor cells (ITCs)
may be present. These are malignant cell
clusters no larger than 0.2 mm.
N1mi means micrometastases
(approximately 200 cells, larger than
0.2 mm, but not larger than 2.0 mm) are
found in lymph nodes.
N1, N2, N3 means regional lymph node
metastases are found. The higher the
number, the more lymph nodes that have
metastases.

3 Breast cancer staging » TNM scores

M = Metastasis

Numbered stages

Cancer that has spread to distant parts of the
body is shown as M1. This is metastatic breast
cancer (MBC). The most common sites for
metastasis are bone and lung.

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores
and receptor (hormone and HER2) status.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with
4 being the most advanced. They might be
written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III,
and stage IV.





M0 means no evidence of distant
metastasis.



M1 means distant metastasis is found.
This is metastatic breast cancer.

Grade
Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells
look under a microscope (called histology).
Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread
faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means
the grade can’t be determined, followed by G1,
G2, and G3. G3 is the highest grade for breast
cancers.

Stage 0 is noninvasive – Noninvasive
breast cancer is rated stage 0. Ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is found only in
the ducts (Tis). It has not spread to the
surrounding breast tissue, lymph nodes
(N0), or distant sites (M0).
Stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive –
Invasive breast cancer is rated stage 1,
2, or 3. It has grown outside the ducts,
lobules, or breast skin. Cancer might be in
the axillary lymph nodes.
Stage 4 is metastatic – In stage
4 breast cancer, cancer has spread to
distant sites at the time of diagnosis.
Metastatic disease more commonly
develops from earlier stages. Sometimes,
the first diagnosis is stage 4 metastatic
breast cancer (called de novo).

affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

Spiritual care specialists identify and
support those with spiritual distress or
unmet spiritual needs.
Smoking cessation specialists
can provide medication and counseling
for those who would like to stop using
tobacco or nicotine products.

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

A research team helps to collect
research data and coordinate care if

Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. More than one
chemotherapy may be used to treat invasive

Antibody drug conjugate

HER2-targeted therapy

An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) delivers
cell-specific chemotherapy. It attaches to a
protein found on the outside of the cancer
cell, then enters the cell. Once inside the cell,
chemotherapy is released. Ado-trastuzumab
emtansine (Kadcyla) and fam-trastuzumab
deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu, T-DXd) attach to
HER2. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (Trodelvy)
attaches to Trop-2. ADCs are given in cycles.

HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. There might be higher amounts of
HER2 in your breast cancer. If this is the case,
it is called HER2-positive (HER2+) breast
cancer. HER2-targeted therapy is drug therapy
that treats HER2+ breast cancer. Some HER2targeted therapy is given with chemotherapy.
However, it might be used alone or in
combination with endocrine therapy.
HER2-targeted therapies include:

Myeloid growth factors



Certain chemotherapies and antibody drug
conjugates can reduce the cells that fight
infection. Treatments with myeloid growth
factors (MGFs) can help increase the number
of white blood cells and prevent infections.





More information on MGFs can be found in the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Anemia and
Neutropenia, at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer
app.

HER2 antibodies prevent HER2 growth
signals from outside the cell. They also
increase the attack of immune cells on
cancer cells.
HER2 inhibitors stop HER2 growth
signals from within the cell.
HER2 conjugates or HER2 antibody
drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver
cell-specific chemotherapy. They attach
directly to HER2s then enter the cell.
Once inside, chemotherapy is released.

Your heart will be monitored before and
during treatment with HER2-targeted therapy.
Tests will measure the left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF), the amount of blood pumping
from the left side of the heart.

Other targeted therapies

mTOR inhibitors
mTOR is a cell protein that helps cells grow
and divide. Endocrine therapy may stop
working if mTOR becomes overactive. mTOR
inhibitors are used to get endocrine therapy
working again.

This section is for inhibitors that are different
from inhibitors used in HER2-targeted therapy.

CDK4/6 inhibitors
Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a cell
protein that helps cells grow and divide.
For hormone receptor-positive (HR+),
HER2-negative cancer, taking a CDK4/6
inhibitor with endocrine therapy may help
control cancer longer and improve survival.
With all CDK4/6 regimens, those who are
premenopausal must also receive ovarian
ablation or suppression. CDK4/6 inhibitors
include abemaciclib (Verzenio), palbociclib
(Ibrance), and ribociclib (Kisqali).

Everolimus (Afinitor) is an mTOR inhibitor.
Most often, it is taken with exemestane. For
some, it may be taken with fulvestrant or
tamoxifen.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a type of systemic
treatment that tries to reactivate the immune
system against tumor cells. The immune
system has many on and off switches.
Tumors take advantage of off switches. Two
leading off switches are PD-1 and CTLA4.
Immunotherapy can block these off switches,
which helps the immune system turn on.
Immunotherapy can be given alone or with
other types of treatment. Pembrolizumab
(Keytruda) and dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli) are
immunotherapy examples.

PARP inhibitors
Cancer cells often become damaged. PARP
is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells and
allows them to survive. Blocking PARP can
cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib (Lynparza)
and talazoparib (Talzenna) are examples of a
PARP inhibitor (PARPi).

PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1
inhibitors
The PIK3CA gene is one of the most frequently
mutated genes in breast cancers. PTEN and
AKT are also part of this important pathway in
cancer cells and can be altered less commonly
in breast cancers. A mutation or alteration in
these genes can lead to increased growth
of cancer cells and resistance to various
treatments. Alpelisib (Piqray) is an example of
a PIK3CA inhibitor and capivasertib (Truqap) is
an AKT1 inhibitor.

4 Treating breast cancer » Endocrine therapy

Endocrine therapy

There is one type of surgical endocrine
therapy:

Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or
progesterone to treat hormone receptorpositive (HR+) breast cancer. The endocrine
system is made up of organs and tissues that
produce hormones. Hormones are natural
chemicals released into the bloodstream.



Other main types of endocrine therapy that
might be used for breast cancer:

There are 4 hormones that might be targeted
in endocrine therapy:










Estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries,
but is also made by other tissues in the
body such as fat tissue.



Progesterone is made mainly by the
ovaries.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) is made by a part
of the brain called the hypothalamus. It
tells the ovaries to make estrogen and
progesterone and testicles to make
testosterone. LHRH is also called
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).



Androgen is made by the adrenal
glands, testicles, and ovaries.

Hormones may cause breast cancer to
grow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body
from making hormones or it will block what
hormones do in the body. This can slow tumor
growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time.



Endocrine therapy is sometimes called
hormone therapy or anti-estrogen. It is not the
same as hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
used for menopause. See Guide 3.





NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Metastatic Breast Cancer, 2024

Bilateral oophorectomy is surgery to
remove both ovaries.

36

Ovarian ablation uses radiation to
permanently stop the ovaries from making
hormones.
Ovarian suppression uses drugs to
temporarily stop the ovaries from making
hormones. It is achieved with drugs called
LHRH agonists. These drugs stop LHRH
from being made, which stops the ovaries
from making hormones. LHRH agonists
include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide
(Lupron Depot). These are injected every
4 or 12 weeks.
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) stop a
type of hormone called androgen from
changing into estrogen by interfering with
an enzyme called aromatase. They do
not affect estrogen made by the ovaries.
Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors include
anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole
(Femara). Exemestane (Aromasin) is a
steroidal aromatase inhibitor.
Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators
or anti-estrogens prevent hormones from
binding to receptors.
Selective estrogen receptor
modulators (SERMs) block estrogen
from attaching to hormone receptors.
They include tamoxifen and toremifene
(Fareston).
Selective estrogen receptor
degraders (SERDs) block and

4 Treating breast cancer » Endocrine therapy

Testosterone

destroy estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant
(Faslodex) and elacestrant (Orserdu) are
SERDs.


For those assigned male at birth whose bodies
continue to make testosterone, endocrine
therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase
inhibitor with a testosterone-suppressing
therapy.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) agonists might be used
to suppress ovarian hormone or
testosterone production.

Endocrine therapy will suppress the production
of hormones and affect one's ability to become
pregnant during treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist before starting endocrine
therapy.

4 Treating breast cancer » Endocrine therapy

Premenopause

Menopause

If you have menstrual periods, you are
in premenopause. In premenopause, the
ovaries are the main source of estrogen and
progesterone.

In menopause, the ovaries permanently stop
producing hormones and menstrual periods
stop. Estrogen and progesterone levels are
low, but the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat
continue to make small amounts of estrogen.
If you don’t have periods, a test using a blood
sample may be used to confirm your status.

GnRH agonists may be used to
temporarily induce menopause for those
in premenopause. A combination of GnRH
agonists and tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors
may be considered as endocrine therapy for
those in premenopause. Ovarian suppression
or ablation can be considered for hormone
receptor-positive (HR+) metastatic breast
cancer.

Cancer treatment can cause a temporary
menopause. If you stopped having periods due
to removal of your uterus (hysterectomy) but
you still have your ovaries, then you should
have your menopausal status confirmed
with a blood test. If both ovaries have been
removed (with or without your uterus), you are
in menopause.

Standard of care is the bestknown way to treat a particular
disease based on past clinical
trials. There may be more than
one treatment regimen that is
considered standard of care. Ask
your care team what treatment
options are available and if a
clinical trial might be right for
you.

4 Treating breast cancer » Bone-strengthening therapy

Bone-strengthening therapy

density tests look for osteoporosis and help
predict your risk for bone fractures.

Medicines that target the bones may be given
to help relieve bone pain or reduce the risk of
bone-related problems. Some medicines work
by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while
others help increase bone thickness.

Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and
denosumab
Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab
are used to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis)
and fractures caused by endocrine therapy.
Zoledronic acid and denosumab are also
used in those with metastatic breast cancer
who have bone metastases to help reduce
the likelihood of fractures, pain, or other
complications arising from cancer in bone.
You might have blood tests to monitor kidney
function, calcium levels, and magnesium
levels. A calcium and vitamin D supplement will
likely be recommended by your doctor.

When breast cancer spreads to distant sites,
it may metastasize in your bones. This puts
your bones at risk for injury and disease. Such
problems include fractures, bone pain, high
calcium levels in the blood, and squeezing
(compression) of the spinal cord. Some
treatments for breast cancer, like aromatase
inhibitors or GnRH agonists, can cause bone
loss (osteoporosis), which put you at an
increased risk for fractures.
Drugs used to prevent bone loss and fractures:


Oral bisphosphonates



Zoledronic acid (Zometa)



Pamidronate (Aredia)



Denosumab (Prolia)

Let your dentist know if you are taking any of
these medicines. Also, ask your care team
how these medicines might affect your teeth
and jaw. Osteonecrosis, or bone tissue death
of the jaw, is a rare but serious side effect. Tell
your care team about any planned trips to the
dentist and surgeries or dental procedures
that might also affect the jawbone. It will be
important to take care of your teeth and to see
a dentist before starting treatment with any of
these drugs.

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

4 Treating breast cancer » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
Rarely. It depends on the study, your health
insurance, and the state in which you live. Your
treatment team and the research team can
help determine if you are responsible for any
costs.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Supportive care
It is important to tell your care
team about all side effects so
they can be managed.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Supportive care might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you are
feeling and about any side effects so they can
be managed. Supportive care, best supportive
care, and palliative care often mean the same
thing.

thromboembolism (VTE) refers to blood clots
in the veins.

Bone health

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.

Breast cancer may spread to your bones.
Some breast cancer treatments may also
weaken your bones. Both can put your bones
at increased risk for injury and disease. Such
problems include bone fractures, bone pain,
and squeezing (compression) of the spinal
cord. High levels of calcium in the blood, called
hypercalcemia, may also occur.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

Medicine may be given to help relieve bone
pain and reduce the risk of other bone
problems. Some medicines work by slowing
or stopping bone breakdown, while others
help increase bone thickness. It is usually
recommended that you take calcium and
vitamin D with these bone health medicines.
Talk to your care team first.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects.

Diarrhea or constipation

Blood clots

Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how to
manage diarrhea. It is important to drink lots of
fluids. Constipation is also common, especially
if taking certain pain medicines. Drinking
fluids, staying active, and taking medicines for
constipation are often recommended.

Cancer or cancer treatment can cause blood
clots to form. This can block blood flow and
oxygen in the body. Blood clots can break
loose and travel to other parts of the body
causing lung problems (pulmonary embolism

Difficulty eating and loss of
appetite

Hair loss
Chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia)
all over your body—not just on your scalp.
Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely
than others to cause hair loss. Dosage might
also affect the amount of hair loss. Most of
the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is
temporary. Hair often regrows 3 to 6 months
after treatment ends. Your hair may be a
different shade or texture. Scalp cooling
(or scalp hypothermia) might help lessen
hair loss in those receiving certain types of
chemotherapy.

Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or other treatments might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
Healthy eating is important during treatment.
It includes eating a balanced diet, eating the
right amount of food, and drinking enough
fluids. A registered dietitian who is an expert in
nutrition and food can help. Speak to your care
team if you have trouble eating or maintaining
your weight.

Distress

Low blood cell counts

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicine that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Some cancer treatments can cause low blood
cell counts.

Fatigue


Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Lymphedema

Neuropathy

Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph
fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.
It may be caused when part of the lymph
system is damaged or blocked, such as
during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment, or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression devices, and
other means.

Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment. Most of the
time, neuropathy goes away after treatment.

Organ issues
Treatment might cause your kidneys, liver,
heart, and pancreas to not work as well as
they should.

Pain

Nausea and vomiting

Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain.

Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting or treat it if you
start to notice symptoms.

QOL

Neurocognitive or
neuropsychological effects

Cancer and its treatment can affect your
overall well-being or quality of life (QOL). For
more information on quality of life, see NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Palliative Care at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN

Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration, memory, and thinking. Survivors
are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be
recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of

Keep a pain diary

Systemic therapy works throughout
the body and is the main treatment for
metastatic breast cancer. The goal of
treatment is to prevent or slow the spread
of cancer.

A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

HER2-targeted therapy is drug therapy
that treats HER2+ breast cancer.
Treatment is a combination of systemic
therapies that are often given in a specific

HER2+

Those with HER2+ and HR+ disease may
also benefit from treatment with endocrine
therapy. These can include aromatase
inhibitors (AIs), tamoxifen, or fulvestrant.
Those who are premenopausal might have
ovarian suppression or ablation in addition to
endocrine therapy.

When HER2 receptors are found (amplified or
overexpressed), the cancer is HER2-positive
(HER2+). It is treated with HER2-targeted
therapy and other systemic therapies as found
in Guide 5.

5 Your treatment options » Monitoring » Disease progression

Monitoring

the case of palliative care, treatment aims to
preserve function and/or maintain comfort.
Goals of treatment may change over time. Talk
with your care team and make your wishes
known.

You will be monitored throughout treatment.
Monitoring includes physical exams, blood
tests, imaging scans, and tumor testing (if
needed). Monitoring is used to see if your
cancer is responding to treatment, is stable, or
is progressing.

Progression or toxicity on
endocrine therapy

Monitoring is important. You will be monitored
for symptoms caused by cancer, such as pain
from bone metastases. The goal of monitoring
is to determine if treatment provides benefit.
Benefit includes keeping cancer stable.

First-line therapy is the first treatment given. If
cancer progresses while on first-line endocrine
therapy, then you will likely switch to a different
endocrine therapy. Targeted therapy might
be added. Sometimes, your cancer becomes
resistant to endocrine therapy. If this happens,
endocrine therapy will be stopped and a
systemic therapy will be used.

It is important to keep follow-up visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care. Continue to take all medicines
as prescribed.

Cancer progresses on systemic
therapy with HER2-targeted
therapy

Disease progression

If cancer progresses while you are on
HER2-targeted therapy, then another line of
therapy is an option. In this case, a different
HER2-targeted therapy will be given.

Disease progression is defined by the growth
or spread of cancer as shown on imaging tests
or physical exam of the tumor.
Most people will be able to have many rounds
(lines) of systemic therapy. After multiple
lines of systemic therapy, it might be time to
consider ending systemic therapy and focus on
supportive care. Supportive care is sometimes
called palliative care. Systemic therapy has
side effects that may impact your quality of
life. If you and your care team decide to stop
systemic therapy, supportive care will continue.
Your preferences and goals of treatment are
always important. The goals of treatment
can be thought of as curative or palliative.
This means that treatment aims to cure or in

In hormone receptor-positive (HR+)
cancer, hormone receptors for estrogen
(ER+) and/or progesterone (PR+) are
found. In HER2-positive (HER2+) cancer,
HER2 receptors are found (amplified or
overexpressed).
Initial treatment for ER+ and/or PR+
with HER2- is endocrine therapy plus
a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Later on, systemic
therapy specific to HER2- breast cancer
will be given.
HER2+ cancer is treated with HER2targeted therapy and other systemic
therapies.
Those with HER2+ and HR+ disease may
also benefit from treatment with endocrine
therapy.
In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),
receptors for estrogen, progesterone,
and HER2 are not found. TNBC is
usually treated with chemotherapy and
sometimes immunotherapy or targeted
therapy.
Before each new line of therapy, you and
your care team will discuss the risks and
benefits of treatment, your overall health,
and your goals for treatment.

relationship with your care team, it will help
you feel supported when considering options
and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your team
share information, discuss the options, and
agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects





Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups
Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
