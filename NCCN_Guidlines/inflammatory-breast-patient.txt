About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Breast Cancer, Version 4.2023 – March 23, 2023.

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)

the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and
ribs. Muscle and ligaments help hold the
breast in place.

cancer cells block lymph vessels

Breast tissue contains glands that can make
milk. These milk glands are called lobules.
Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small
tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the
nipple.

in the skin of the breast. This
causes the breast to look red
and swollen and feel warm to the
touch.

The ring of darker breast skin is called the
areola. The raised tip within the areola is called
the nipple. The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is
a term that refers to both parts.
Lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water
and food. It also helps to fight germs. Lymph
drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels
and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit
(axilla). Nodes near the armpit are called
axillary lymph nodes (ALNs)

The breast
The breast is an organ and a gland found
on the chest. The breast is made of milk
ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels,
ligaments, and other connective tissue. Behind

Invasive ductal carcinoma
Most inflammatory breast
cancers are invasive ductal
carcinomas. This means that
cancer started in the cells
that line the milk ducts and
has spread into surrounding

Breast cancer

Inflammatory breast cancer

Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast.
Almost all breast cancers are a subtype called
carcinomas. Carcinomas are cancers that start
in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces
of the body.

Most inflammatory breast cancers (IBCs) are
invasive ductal carcinomas. This means that
cancer started in the cells that line the milk
ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue.
It’s important not to dismiss any strange skin
changes to the breast, including redness,
swollen nipple area, or warmth to the touch.
Seek medical attention right away.

There are different types of breast carcinoma.
The most common types are either ductal or
lobular.




Possible signs of IBC:

Ductal carcinoma starts in the cells
that line the milk ducts. Milk ducts are
thin tubes that carry milk from the lobules
of the breast to the nipple. It is the most
common type of breast cancer.





Lobular carcinoma starts in the
lobules (milk glands) of the breast. It is
the second most common type of breast
cancer.





Inflammatory breast

In inflammatory breast cancer
(IBC), cancer cells block
lymph vessels in the skin
of the breast. This causes
the breast to look red and

Key points

Like other breast cancers, IBC can happen in
those assigned male at birth. Although there
are some differences between those assigned
male and those assigned female at birth,
treatment is very similar for all genders.

“

Anyone can develop breast cancer, but
breast cancer occurs more frequently in
persons assigned female at birth.
Inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat,
blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and
connective tissue. Lobules are structures
that make breast milk. Ducts carry breast
milk from the lobules to the nipple.
Breast cancer often starts in the ducts
or lobules and then spreads into the
surrounding tissue.
In inflammatory breast cancer (IBC),
cancer cells block lymph vessels in the
skin of the breast. This causes the breast
to look red and swollen and feel warm to
the touch.

For weeks my bra had been feeling uncomfortably tight. I tried to
ignore it but then felt sharp, shooting pains and the skin looked
'funny.' It took multiple office visits and finally to a surgeon to
learn I had inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). I'm a nurse and
didn't know you could have breast cancer without a lump."

Testing for IBC » Test results

Treatment planning starts with



testing. This chapter presents an
overview of the tests you might
receive and what to expect.


IBC can be difficult to diagnose. Often, there
is no lump that can be felt during a breast
exam or seen on a mammogram. Since there
is swelling (edema) and redness (erythema)
of the breast, IBC can look like an infection
and therefore be difficult to diagnose. Often, a
biopsy of the affected skin is done to diagnose
the tumor.





Test results
You will have blood tests, imaging tests, and a
biopsy to stage the cancer. The biopsy sample
will be tested for hormone receptors (estrogen
and progesterone) and HER2 receptors.
Treatment will be based on these findings.



Keep these things in mind:



Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.
Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Inflammatory Breast Cancer, 2023

Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.
Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.
Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list.
Include in your contact list information on
the exact type of cancer, as well as any
treatments and the date they started.

For possible tests, see Guide 1.

It is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions and keep copies of your
test results. Online patient portals are a great
way to access your test results.



Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.

Testing for IBC » General health tests

General health tests

Family history
Some cancers and other diseases can run in
families. Your doctor will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members on both sides of
your family about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what
age they were diagnosed. It’s important to
know the specific type of cancer, or where the
cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations,
and if they had genetic testing.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
(OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you
take. Some supplements interact and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Guide 1
Possible tests
Medical history and physical exam (H&P) by multidisciplinary team. Medical photographs will also
be taken.
Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) including liver function tests
(LFTs), and alkaline phosphatase
Biopsy with pathology review
Determine tumor status including:
• Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) hormone receptor (HR) status
• HER2 status
Address fertility, birth control, and sexual health concerns
Genetic counseling and testing if at risk for hereditary breast cancer
Imaging:
• Diagnostic mammogram. Ultrasound and breast MRI, as needed
• Chest CT. Contrast might be used.
• CT or MRI of abdomen with or without pelvis. Contrast will be used.
• Bone scan or PET-CT

Physical exam
During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:


Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat

Create a medical binder
A medical binder or notebook is a great way
to organize all of your records in one place.

3 Make copies of blood tests, imaging

results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.

needs. Consider a zipper pocket to
include a pen, small calendar, and
insurance cards.

Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

3 Create folders for insurance forms, test
types (ie, blood, imaging, pathology,
radiology, genetics), treatments, and
procedures. Organize items in the
folder by date.

Clinical breast exam
Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam
of the bare breast performed by a health care
provider to check for lumps or other changes.
It is done while you are seated and/or lying
down. Your provider should take time to
palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the
armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in
the room during the exam.

3 Use online patient portals to view

your test results and other records.
Download or print the records to add to
your binder.

3 Add a section for questions and to take
notes.

Bring your medical binder to appointments.
You never know when you might need it!

Testing for IBC » Fertility (all genders) » Preventing pregnancy during treatment

Fertility (all genders)

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment

Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect
your fertility, the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might change your fertility. To preserve your
fertility, you may need to take action before
starting cancer treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options
before starting treatment.

Preventing pregnancy during treatment is
important. Cancer and cancer treatment
can affect the ovaries and damage sperm.
Hormonal birth control may or may not be
recommended, so ask your doctor about
options such as intrauterine devices (IUDs)
and barrier methods. Types of barrier methods
include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps,
and the contraceptive sponge.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want
to have children later in life or aren’t really
sure at the moment. Fertility and reproductive
specialists can help you sort through what may
be best for your situation.

Those with ovaries

More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing
baby if you are or become pregnant during
treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. Non-hormonal birth control
methods (barrier methods, IUDs) are preferred
after a breast cancer diagnosis. If you are
pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your
cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will need
to be avoided.

Changes in fertility

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
“period” may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended during and after treatment.
Consult your doctor for the best time to plan a
pregnancy.

Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Inflammatory Breast Cancer, 2023

Those with testicles
Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth
control) such as condoms and IUDs to prevent

Pregnancy test

pregnancy during and immediately after cancer
treatment.

Those who can become pregnant will be given
a pregnancy test before treatment begins.

Blood tests
Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein. Some
blood tests you might have are described next.

Those who want to have children in the
future should be referred to a fertility
specialist before starting treatment.

Alkaline phosphatase
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found
in the blood. High levels of ALP can be a sign
cancer has spread to the bone or liver. A bone
scan might be performed if you have high levels
of ALP.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures
the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in
your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells fight
infection, and platelets control bleeding.

Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures 14 different substances in your
blood. It is usually done on the plasma part
of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.

Liver function tests
Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health of
your liver by measuring chemicals that are made
or processed by the liver. Levels that are too
high or low signal that the liver is not working
well or that cancer has spread to the liver.

Testing for IBC » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

Diagnostic mammogram

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Imaging tests show the primary
tumor, or where the cancer started, and look
for cancer in other parts of the body.

A mammogram is a picture of the insides
of your breast. The pictures are made
using x-rays. A computer combines the
x-rays to make detailed pictures. A bilateral
mammogram includes pictures of both
breasts. Mammogram results are used to plan
treatment.

A radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report to
your doctor. The doctor will discuss the results
with you. While these reports are available to
you through your patient portal, please wait to
discuss these results with the doctor.

Diagnostic mammograms look at specific
areas of your breasts, which may not be
clearly seen on screening mammograms.
They are used to see tumor and the size
of the tumor(s). Diagnostic mammograms
include extra compression in certain areas
of the breast, magnification views, or rolling
the breast to image additional areas of the
breast. Other tests may include a breast MRI
or ultrasound.

The following imaging tests are not in order of
importance. You will not have all of these tests.

Bone scan
A bone scan uses a radiotracer. A radiotracer
is a substance that releases small amounts of
radiation. Before the pictures are taken, the
tracer will be injected into your vein. It can take
a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones.
However, the test is quick and painless.

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

A special camera will take pictures of the
tracer in your bones as it moves over your
body. Areas of bone damage take up more
radiotracer than healthy bone and show up
as bright spots on the pictures. Bone damage
can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment,
previous injuries, or other health issues.

Bone x-ray

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

An x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one
picture at a time. A tumor changes the way
radiation is absorbed and will show up on the
x-ray. X-rays are also good at showing bone
issues. Your care team may order x-rays if
your bones hurt or were abnormal on a bone
scan.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Inflammatory Breast Cancer, 2023

Testing for IBC » Imaging tests

Breast MRI
If needed, a breast MRI will be used in
addition to a mammogram. Contrast should
be used. You will be positioned face down
in the machine with your arms above your
head.

What’s the difference
between a screening and
diagnostic mammogram?

Spine and brain MRI
An MRI can be used to detect breast cancer
that has spread (metastasize) to your spine
or brain. For a brain MRI, a device is placed
around your head. For a spine MRI, no
device is worn. Contrast should be used in
an MRI.

A mammogram is a picture of the inside of
your breast made using x-rays. During a
mammogram, the breast is pressed between
two plates while you stand in different
positions. Multiple x-rays will be taken. A
computer combines the x-rays to make
detailed pictures.

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes
many x-rays of the same body part from
different angles. All the images are combined
to make one detailed picture. Intravenous
(IV) contrast is often used.

•

Screening mammograms are done on a
regular basis when there are no signs or
symptoms of breast cancer. Results take
a few days.

•

Diagnostic mammograms are used for
those who have symptoms such as a
lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge,
or whose breasts have changed shape or
size.

•

Diagnostic mammograms are also used
to take a closer look at an abnormal area
found in a screening mammogram.

•

A radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic
mammogram while you wait so if
additional testing is needed, it can be
done right away.

•

Both types of mammograms use lowdose x-rays to examine the breast.
They may use either the standard
2-dimensional (2D) digital mammography
or 3-dimensional (3D) mammograms
known as tomosynthesis.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that
help enhance and improve the images of
several organs and structures in the body.
It is used to make the pictures clearer. The
contrast is not permanent and will leave the
body in your urine immediately after the test.
The types of contrast vary and are different for
CT and MRI.
Tell your doctors if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past, especially to
iodine or to shellfish such as shrimp. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast

Testing for IBC » Imaging tests

might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

PET scan

Inflammatory breast
cancer can be difficult
to diagnose. Ask for
a referral to a breast
specialist, if possible.

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans. However, not all tumors will
appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright
spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain,
heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on
PET. Inflammation or infection can also show
up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET-CT scan.
It may be done with one or two machines
depending on the cancer center.

Ultrasound
An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer)
will be held and moved on your bare breast
using gel. It may also be placed below your
armpit. Ultrasound is painless and does not
use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed.
Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of
cancer that are near the skin. Sometimes, a
breast ultrasound or MRI is used to guide a
biopsy.

Sodium fluoride PET-CT
A sodium fluoride PET-CT might be used
instead of a bone scan. In this test, the
radiotracer is made of sodium fluoride.
FDG PET-CT
An FDG PET-CT uses a radiotracer called F-18
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made of fluoride
and a simple form of sugar called glucose.
You cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours
before the scan. This scan is most helpful when
other imaging results are unclear. It may help
find cancer in lymph nodes and distant sites.
If it clearly shows cancer in the bone, a bone
scan and sodium fluoride PET-CT may not be
needed. FDG PET-CT can be done at the same
time as a CT used for diagnosis.
FES PET-CT
FES is a radioactive form of the hormone
estrogen. It might be used instead of FDG
PET-CT when cancer is estrogen receptorpositive (ER+).

tissue or fluid. In a vacuum-assisted core
biopsy (VACB), suction is used to remove
the sample with a special vacuum device.

A biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample
of tissue or fluid. The sample is sent to a lab
for testing. A pathologist will examine the
biopsy for cancer and write a report called a
pathology report. Ask questions about your
biopsy results and what it means for your
treatment.





There are different types of biopsies. Some
biopsies are guided using imaging, such as
mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI. The primary
or main tumor is biopsied first. Other tumors or
tumors in different areas may also be biopsied.
You may have tissue removed from the breast,
lymph nodes, or both.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or
core biopsy (CB) uses needles of
different sizes to remove a sample of

Biopsy
In a biopsy, a sample of

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Inflammatory Breast Cancer, 2023

Excisional biopsy removes the entire
abnormal area. This is not the preferred
type of biopsy but may be necessary
if other methods are not possible or
when the biopsy results don’t match the
expected findings.
Skin biopsy takes a small sample of
inflamed skin on the breast.

Before biopsies are performed, usually the
area is injected with numbing medicine. A core
needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one
tissue sample, but usually through the same
area on the breast. The samples are small.

Types of possible biopsies include:


Incisional biopsy removes a small
amount of tissue through a cut in the skin
or body.

17

Testing for IBC » Biopsy

Axillary lymph node needle
biopsy

The needle is often guided into the tumor with
imaging. When mammography is used during a
biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy.

An axillary lymph node (ALN) drains lymph
fluid from the breast and nearby areas. In an
axillary lymph node biopsy, a sample of lymph
node near the armpit (axilla) is biopsied with
a needle. This is to determine if abnormal
lymph nodes seen on imaging tests contain
cancer cells. An ultrasound-guided fine-needle
aspiration (US-FNA) or core biopsy will be
used. If cancer is found, it is called node
positive (node+). A marker may be placed in the
node so that it can be identified later if needed.

One or more clips may be placed near the
breast tumor during a biopsy. The clips are
small, painless, and made of metal. They will
mark the site for future treatment and imaging.
The clips will stay in place until surgery. If the
area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain
in place to mark the biopsy site on future
imaging. The clips cause no problems, even
if they are left in place for a long time. You will
be able to go through airport security and have
an MRI.
There are both physical and emotional
experiences in having biopsies. You may need
to rest and place an ice pack on the biopsy
area after the procedure. If you are working
or have other commitments, you may want
to take the day off to recover emotionally and
physically from the experience.

Standard of care is the best known
way to treat particular disease
based on past clinical trials. There
may be more than one treatment
regimen that is considered
standard of care. Ask your care
team what treatment options are
available and if a clinical trial might
be right for you.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy

Biopsy results

A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph
node that cancer cells are most likely to spread
to from a primary tumor. Sometimes, there
can be more than one sentinel lymph node.
Removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during
surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB or SNB). This procedure is done during
surgery such as a mastectomy (surgery to
remove the breast) or lumpectomy (surgery
to remove the tumor) to determine if any
cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes.
The lymph nodes removed are called the
sentinel nodes. They may or may not contain
any cancer cells. Just because these nodes
are removed, it does not mean that they are
positive for cancer.

Histology is the study of the anatomy
(structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under
a microscope. It is used to make treatment
decisions. Your pathology report will contain
information about histology. You may be
recommended to have an open biopsy
(surgery) to remove (excise) the tumor to
confirm histology. Talk to your health care
provider for more information on next steps.

To find the sentinel lymph nodes, a radioactive
material and other dyes are injected into the
area where breast tumor is located. From
here, the dye travels through the lymphatics
in the breast to the lymph nodes. This helps
the surgeon find which of the nodes are
the sentinel lymph nodes. Once the nodes
are found, those containing the radioactive
material or dye are removed and tested by a
pathologist. If cancer is found, then more than
the sentinel lymph nodes may be removed.

Skin biopsy
A sample of inflamed skin on the breast will
likely be removed to diagnose inflammatory
breast cancer.

Testing for IBC » Hormone receptor status

Hormone receptor status

HR+ breast cancer is treated with endocrine
therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor
signaling.

A hormone is a substance made by a gland
in your body. Your blood carries hormones
throughout your body. A receptor is a protein
found inside or on the surface of a cell.
Substances such as hormones attach (bind) to
these receptors. This causes changes within
the cell.

Hormone receptor-negative
Hormone receptor-negative (HR-) breast
cancer cells do not have either estrogen or
progesterone hormone receptors. These
cancers are sometimes simply called hormone
negative. HR- cancers often grow faster
than HR+ cancers. Both the estrogen and
progesterone receptors need to be negative for
the cancer to be considered HR-.

Hormones recognize and bind to specific
hormone receptors. When hormones attach
to receptors on breast cancer cells, they can
cause cancer to grow. If found, these receptors
may be targeted using endocrine therapy.
There are 2 types of hormone receptors:




Estrogen – plays a role in breast
development

Estrogen receptor-positive
(ER+) breast cancer cells

Progesterone – plays a role in
menstrual cycle and pregnancy

3 In ER+ breast cancer, testing finds

estrogen hormone receptors in at
least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells.

Hormone receptor (HR) testing should be done
on any new tumors. A biopsy sample will be
used.

3 In ER-low–positive invasive breast

cancer, testing finds estrogen
hormone receptors in 1 to 10 out of
every 100 cancer cells.

Hormone receptor-positive
In hormone receptor-positive (HR+)
breast cancer, IHC finds estrogen and/or
progesterone hormone receptors. Most breast
cancers are HR+.




3 Endocrine therapy might not be

recommended for ER-low–positive
invasive breast cancer.

Estrogen receptor (ER) is stimulated
by estrogen and provides survival and
proliferation (rapid growth) signals.
Cancer cells deprived of estrogen or
which have their ER signal blocked with
treatment may stop growing or die.
Progesterone receptor (PR) binds
progesterone and also provides survival
and proliferation signals. It is thought that
PR expression also suggests the tumor is
estrogen dependent.

Testing for IBC » HER2 status » Biomarker testing

HER2 status

Biomarker testing

Inflammatory breast cancers often produce
greater than normal amounts of HER2. Human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
is a protein involved in normal cell growth.
It is found on the surface of all cells. When
amounts are high, it causes cells to grow and
divide. Some breast cancers have too many
HER2 genes or receptors. Too many HER2s is
called HER2-positive (HER2+). You might hear
it called HER2 overexpression or amplification.

A sample from a biopsy of your tumor
may be tested to look for specific DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations,
protein levels, or other molecular features.
This information is used to choose the best
treatment for you. It is sometimes called
molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor
sequencing, gene expression profiling, or
genomic testing.
Biomarker testing includes tests of genes
or their products (proteins). It identifies
the presence or absence of mutations and
certain proteins that might suggest treatment.
Proteins are written like this: BRCA. Genes are
written with italics like this: BRCA. HER2 and
hormone receptor status are part of biomarker
testing. Your treatment team will recommend
the best types of biomarker testing that are
important for you.

There are 2 tests for HER2:




Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
measures receptors. If the IHC score is
3+, the cancer is HER2+. If the score is 0
or 1, it is considered HER2-. If the score
is 2+, further testing is needed.
In situ hybridization (ISH) counts the
number of copies of the HER2 gene. This
test is done mainly when the IHC score is
unclear.

Tumor markers

HER2 testing should be done on all new
tumors. A tumor biopsy sample will be used.
You might have more than one HER2 test.

Your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested for
proteins. Examples of some tumor markers
in breast cancer include carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA), CA 15-3, and CA 27.29. An
increase in the level of certain tumor markers
could mean that the cancer has grown or
spread (progressed). However, not everyone
has elevated levels of these markers and
tumor markers alone are not a reliable method
of detecting breast cancer.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to cells. These cells are then
studied using a microscope. IHC can find
estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors
in breast cancer cells. A pathologist will
measure how many cells have estrogen and/
or progesterone receptors and the number of
receptors inside each cell.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Inflammatory Breast Cancer, 2023

Tumor mutational burden
When there are 10 or more mutations per
million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H). TMB-H
can be used to help predict response to cancer
treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors
that target the proteins called programmed

21

Testing for IBC » Biomarker testing

FISH

death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a testing method that involves special dyes
called probes that attach to pieces of DNA, the
genetic material in a person’s cells.

Tumor mutation testing
A sample of your tumor or blood may be used
to see if the cancer cells have any specific
DNA mutations. This is a different type of DNA
testing than the genetic testing for mutations
you may have inherited from your parents.
In tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is
tested and not the rest of your body. Certain
mutations such as PIK3CA can be targeted
with specific therapies.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to cancer or immune cells.
The cells are then studied using a microscope.

Next-generation sequencing

MSI-H/dMMR mutation

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a highthroughput method used to determine the DNA
sequence or gene changes of cancer cells in
your tumor. This method would only be used
if enough tumor tissue remains after other
biomarker testing has been completed.

Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of
DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are
fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.
Some cancers have DNA mutations for
changes that prevent these errors from being
fixed. This is called microsatellite instability
(MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).
When cancer cells have more than a normal
number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H
(microsatellite instability-high). This is often
due to dMMR genes.

PCR
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions of
copies of your DNA (genetic information). PCR
is very sensitive. It can find 1 abnormal cell
among more than 100,000 normal cells. These
copies called PCR product might be used for
NGS.

PD-1 and PD-L1 testing
Programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) are
immune proteins. If either protein is expressed
on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause
your immune cells to ignore the cancer and
suppress the anti-tumor immune response. If
your cancer expresses either protein, you might
have treatment that combines chemotherapy
and a checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This is
designed to activate your immune system to
better fight off the cancer cells.

Testing for IBC » Genetic risk testing

Genetic risk testing
About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are
hereditary. Depending on your family history or
other features of your cancer, your health care
provider might refer you for hereditary genetic
testing to learn more about your cancer. A
genetic counselor or trained provider will speak
to you about the results. Tests results may be
used to guide treatment planning.

What is your family
cancer health history?
Some cancers and other diseases run in
families—those who are related to you
through genes passed down from biological
parent to child. This information is called a
family health history. Ask blood relatives about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed. For relatives who were diagnosed
with cancer, ask them (or other relatives if
they are no longer living) what type of cancer
they had, if they died from the cancer, and at
what age the cancer was diagnosed.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). The
goal is to look for gene mutations inherited
from your biological parents called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You
can pass these genes on to your children.
Also, other family members might carry these
mutations. Tell your care team if there is a
family history of cancer.

BRCA tests
Everyone has BRCA genes. Normal BRCA
genes help to prevent tumor growth. They help
fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally.
BRCA mutations put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. Mutations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian,
prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma
skin cancers. Mutated BRCA genes can also
affect how well some treatments work. These
tests might be repeated.

Start by asking your parents, siblings, and
children. Next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and
uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents,
and grandchildren.
Write down what you learn about your family
history and share this information with your
health care provider.
Some of the questions to ask include:

3 How old were you when each of these
diseases and health conditions was
diagnosed?

3 What is our family’s ancestry – from what
countries did our ancestors originate?

Testing for IBC » Distress screening » Key points

Distress screening

Performance status

It is normal to have strong feelings about being
diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can
also change from day to day and week to
week. Talk to your care team and those whom
you feel most comfortable about how you are
feeling. There are services and people who
can help you. Support and counseling are
available. Dealing with a cancer diagnosis may
sometimes be stressful and may cause distress.
Your treatment team will screen your level of
distress. This is part of your cancer care.

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be
rated using a PS scale called ECOG (Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group). PS is one
factor taken into consideration when choosing
a treatment plan. Your preferences about
treatment are always important.

ECOG PS
The ECOG PS scores range from 0 to 5.

Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You
may also experience depression, anxiety, and
sleep issues.






More information on distress can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.







PS 0 means the person is fully active.
PS 1 means the person is still able to
perform light to moderate activity, but with
some limitations.
PS 2 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed less than half of the time and
is still able to care for self.
PS 3 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed more than half of the time.
PS 4 means the person is totally confined
to the bed or chair and completely unable
to care for self.
PS 5 means the person is not alive.

In breast cancer, PS might be referred to as
good or poor. Good PS is usually PS 0 or PS 1.

A diagnostic mammogram includes
detailed pictures of both breasts. It is
different than a screening mammogram.

Testing takes time. It
might take days or
weeks before all test
results come in.

During a biopsy, tissue or fluid samples
are removed for testing. Samples are
needed to confirm the presence of cancer
and to perform cancer cell tests.
A sample from a biopsy of your tumor
will be tested for estrogen receptor (ER)
status, progesterone receptor (PR) status,
HER2 status, and grade (histology). This
provides information about the behavior
of your cancer, as well as treatments to
which your cancer may respond.
About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are

Breast cancer staging » How breast cancer is staged

Cancer staging is used to reflect

take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.

prognosis and to guide treatment

Staging includes:

decisions. It describes the size



and location of the tumor and
if cancer has spread to lymph
nodes, organs, or other parts



of the body. It also takes into
account hormone receptor and
HER2 status.

Most inflammatory breast cancers (IBCs) are
invasive ductal carcinomas. This means that
cancer started in the cells that line the milk
ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue.
At diagnosis, IBC is stage 3 or 4 disease. In
stage 3, the tumor can be any size and in
the lymph nodes, the lymph nodes can be
fixed (or not moveable), or the cancer can
involve the skin or chest wall. It is sometimes
called advanced disease. In stage 4, cancer
has spread to other parts of the body
(metastasized).

Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM
plus tumor grade and the status of the
biomarkers such as human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen
receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor
(PR). Prognostic stage also includes the
assumption that you are treated with the
standard-of-care approaches.

Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and
pathologic. Pathologic stage applies to those
who have undergone surgery as the initial
treatment for breast cancer. Breast cancer
staging is often done twice, before and after
surgery. Staging after surgery provides more
specific and accurate details about the size of
the cancer and lymph node status.


How breast cancer is
staged



A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging.

Clinical stage (c) is the rating given
before any treatment. It is based on a
physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests.
An example might look like cN2 or cM1.
Pathologic stage (p) or surgical
stage is determined by examining tissue
removed during surgery. An example
might be pN2. If you are given drug
therapy before surgery, then the stage
might look like ypT3.

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins. Doctors may
explain your cancer stage in different ways
than described next.

Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A



The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage breast cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different areas
of cancer growth. Based on cancer test results,
your doctor will assign a score or number to
each letter. The higher the number, the larger
the tumor or the more the cancer has spread.
These scores will be combined to assign the
cancer a stage. A TNM example might look like
this: T3N2M0 or T32, N2, M0.

The extent (size) of the tumor (T):
How large is the cancer? Has it grown
into nearby areas?
The spread to nearby lymph nodes
(N): Has the cancer spread to nearby
lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where?
The spread (metastasis) to distant
sites (M): Has the cancer spread to
distant organs such as the lungs or liver?
Estrogen receptor (ER) status: Does
the cancer have the protein called an
estrogen receptor?



Progesterone receptor (PR) status:
Does the cancer have the protein called a
progesterone receptor?





Human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) status: Does the
cancer make too much of a protein called
HER2?

T (tumor) – Depth and spread of the
main (primary) tumor(s) in one or both
breasts
N (node) – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes
M (metastasis) -– If cancer has
spread to distant parts of the body or
metastasized

T = Tumor

Grade of the cancer (G): How much
do the cancer cells look like normal cells?

The primary tumor size can be measured in
centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). One
inch is equal to 2.54 cm. A large pea is 1 cm
(10 mm). A golf ball is 4 cm (40 mm). A tumor
micrometastasis is a very small collection of
cancerous cells smaller than 1 mm. It might be
written as T1mi. Ipsilateral means on the same
side of the body.

Biomarker testing: Does the cancer
have any genes, proteins, markers, or
mutations that might suggest treatment?

found in lymph nodes.

Lymph, a clear fluid containing cells that help
fight infections and other diseases, drains
through channels into lymphatic vessels. From
here, lymph drains into lymph nodes. There
are hundreds of lymph nodes throughout
your body. They work as filters to help fight
infection and remove harmful things from your
body. Regional lymph nodes are those located
near the tumor in the breast. If breast cancer
spreads, it often goes first to nearby lymph
nodes under the arm. It can also sometimes
spread to lymph nodes near the collarbone or
near the breastbone. Knowing if the cancer
has spread to your lymph nodes helps doctors
find the best way to treat your cancer.

M1 means distant metastasis is found.
This is metastatic breast cancer.

Breast cancer staging » TNM scores

Grade

Numbered stages

Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells
look under a microscope (called histology).
Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread
faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means
the grade can’t be determined, followed by G1,
G2, and G3. G3 is the highest grade for breast
cancers. A low-grade tumor has a low risk of
recurrence. A high-grade tumor has a higher
risk of recurrence (of cancer returning).

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores
and receptor (hormone and HER2) status.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with 4
being the most advanced. They might be written
as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage
IV.



GX – Grade cannot be determined



G1 – Low



G2 – Intermediate



G3 – High

Stage 0 is noninvasive
Noninvasive breast cancer is rated stage 0.
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is found only
in the ducts (Tis). It has not spread to the
surrounding breast tissue, lymph nodes (N0) or
distant sites (M0).
Stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive
Invasive breast cancer is rated stage 1, 2, or
3. It has grown outside the ducts, lobules, or
breast skin. Cancer might be in the axillary
lymph nodes.
Stage 4 is metastatic
In stage 4 breast cancer, cancer has spread
to distant sites. It can develop from earlier
stages. Sometimes, the first diagnosis is stage
4 metastatic breast cancer (called de novo).

Treating IBC » Treatment overview

There are many treatment options. However,
not everyone will respond to treatment in the
same way. Some people will do better than
expected. Others will do worse. Many factors
play a role in how the cancer will respond to
treatment.

IBC is treated with systemic therapy to shrink
the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the
breast and lymph nodes, and then radiation
therapy. Surgery is not always possible.
Even though surgery might not be an option,
systemic therapy will continue. Systemic
treatment is based on estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2
expression. It is important to have regular
talks with your care team about your goals for
treatment and your treatment plan.

Treating IBC » Mastectomy

Mastectomy

When preparing for surgery, seek the opinion
of an experienced surgeon. The surgeon
should be an expert in performing your type of
surgery. Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating your type of cancer.

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. A mastectomy
removes all or part of the breast. Inflammatory
breast cancer is often treated with a modified
radical mastectomy. In a modified radical
mastectomy, the breast and underarm (axilla)
sentinel lymph nodes are removed. Before
removing the breast, the surgeon may do a
sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Sentinel
lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes cancer
cells are likely to have spread from the primary
tumor.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, protons, and
other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink
tumors. Radiation therapy can be given alone
or before or after surgery to treat or slow the
growth of cancer. Sometimes, radiation is
given with certain systemic therapies. It may
be used as supportive care to help ease pain
or discomfort caused by cancer. Most types
of radiation include several short treatment

Breast reconstruction is an option after a
mastectomy. If you opt for reconstruction, it
will be done after finishing cancer treatment.
This is called delayed reconstruction. Breast
reconstruction is often done in stages. You
might want to consult with a plastic surgeon.

Modified radical
mastectomy
The dotted line shows where
the entire breast and some
lymph nodes are removed.
Part of the chest wall muscle
may also be removed.

sessions that are given once daily over a few
days to weeks. Ask your care team which
radiation option(s) are best for you and what
side effects to expect.
Radiation may be given to the chest wall,
infraclavicular region (below the collarbone),
supraclavicular area (above the collarbone), or
lymph nodes found in the axillary bed (armpit).
Lymph node radiation therapy is also called
regional nodal irradiation (RNI)

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking
or avoid certain herbal supplements
when on a systemic therapy. Some
supplements can affect the ability of a
drug to do its job. This is called a drug
interaction.

External beam radiation therapy
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body called a linear
accelerator (linac) to aim radiation at the whole
breast (WBRT) and lymph nodes (RNI).

It is critical to speak with your care
team about any supplements you may
be taking. Some examples include:

Chemotherapy
Systemic therapy is drug therapy that works
throughout the body. It is used before surgery
to shrink the tumor or reduce the amount of
cancer (called cancer burden).




Preoperative is systemic (drug)
treatment given before surgery. It is also
called neoadjuvant therapy.

Turmeric



Gingko biloba



Green tea extract



St. John’s Wort



Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy. Therefore, it is very
important to tell your care team about any
medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter
(OTC) drugs, herbals, or supplements you
are taking.

Postoperative is systemic (drug)
treatment given after surgery. It is also
called adjuvant therapy.

Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer
cells and some normal cells. More than
one chemotherapy may be used to treat
inflammatory breast cancer. When only one
drug is used, it’s called a single agent. A
combination or multi-agent regimen is the use
of two or more chemotherapy drugs.

Treating IBC » Myeloid growth factors

HER2-targeted therapy

Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are
infused into a vein or injected under the skin
with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs may
be given as a pill that is swallowed.

HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. There might be higher amounts of
HER2 in your breast cancer. If this is the
case, it is called HER2-positive (HER2+)
breast cancer. HER2-targeted therapy is drug
therapy that treats HER2+ breast cancer.
Most often, HER2-targeted therapy is given
with chemotherapy. However, it might be
used alone or in combination with endocrine
therapy.

Some examples of chemotherapy drugs
include:






Doxorubicin (Adriamcyin), doxorubicin
liposomal injection (Doxil), and epirubicin
(Ellence) are anthracyclines.
Docetaxel, paclitaxel, and albumin-bound
paclitaxel are taxanes.

HER2-targeted therapies include:

Capecitabine (Xeloda), fluorouracil,
gemcitabine (Gemzar, Infugem), and
methotrexate are antimetabolites.



Most chemotherapy is given in cycles of
treatment days followed by days of rest.
This allows the body to recover before the
next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending
on which drugs are used. The number of
treatment days per cycle and the total number
of cycles given also vary.





Myeloid growth factors

HER2 inhibitors stop growth signals
from HER2 from within the cell.
HER2 conjugates or antibody
drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver cellspecific chemotherapy. They attach to
HER2s then enter the cell. Once inside,
chemotherapy is released.

Your heart will be monitored before and during
treatment with trastuzumab. Tests will measure
the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the
amount of blood pumping from the left side of
the heart.

Certain chemotherapies can reduce the cells
that fight infection. Treatments with myeloid
growth factors (MGFs) can help increase
the number of white blood cells and prevent
infections.
More information on myeloid growth factors,
can be found in the NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Anemia and Neutropenia, at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Inflammatory Breast Cancer, 2023

HER2 antibodies prevent growth
signals from HER2 from outside the cell.
They also increase the attack of immune
cells on cancer cells.

Inhibitors

Did you know?

This section is for inhibitors that are different
from inhibitors used in HER2-targeted therapy.

The terms “chemotherapy” and
“systemic therapy” are often
used interchangeably, but they
are not the same. Systemic
therapy works throughout the
body and includes chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, immunotherapy,
endocrine therapy, and others.

CDK4/6 inhibitors
Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a cell
protein that helps cells grow and divide. For
hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2cancer, taking a CDK4/6 inhibitor with
endocrine therapy may help control cancer
longer. With all CDK4/6 regimens, those who
are premenopausal must also receive ovarian
ablation or suppression. CDK4/6 inhibitors
include abemaciclib (Verzenio), palbociclib
(Ibrance), and ribociclib (Kisqali).
mTOR inhibitors
mTOR is a cell protein that helps cells grow
and divide. Endocrine therapy may stop
working if mTOR becomes overactive. mTOR
inhibitors are used to get endocrine therapy
working again.

PIK3CA inhibitor
The PIK3CA gene is one of the most
frequently mutated genes in breast cancers.
A mutation in this gene can lead to increased
growth of cancer cells and resistance to
various treatments. Alpelisib (Piqray) is an
example of a PIK3CA inhibitor.

Everolimus (Afinitor) is an mTOR inhibitor.
Most often, it is taken with exemestane. For
some, it may be taken with fulvestrant or
tamoxifen.

Immunotherapy

PARP inhibitors
Cancer cells often become damaged. PARP
is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells
and allows them to survive. Blocking PARP
can cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib
(Lynparza) and talazoparib (Talzenna) are
PARP inhibitors. You must have the BRCA1
or BRCA2 mutation and your breast cancer
must be HER2- for PARP inhibitors to be
considered.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Inflammatory Breast Cancer, 2023

Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment
that tries to re-activate the immune system
against tumor cells. The immune system
has many on and off switches. Tumors
take advantage of "off switches." Two
leading off switches are PD-1 and CTLA4.
Immunotherapy can be given alone or with
other types of treatment. An immunotherapy
example is pembrolizumab (Keytruda).

39

Treating IBC » Endocrine therapy

Endocrine therapy

Other main types of endocrine therapy include:

Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or
progesterone to treat hormone receptorpositive (HR+) breast cancer. The endocrine
system is made up of organs and tissues that
produce hormones. Hormones are natural
chemicals released into the bloodstream.





There are 4 hormones that might be targeted
in endocrine therapy:








Estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries,
and also by other tissues in the body such
as the fat tissue.
Progesterone is made mainly by the
ovaries.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) is made by a part
of the brain called the hypothalamus. It
tells the ovaries to make estrogen and
progesterone and testicles to make
testosterone. LHRH is also called
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).



Androgen is made by the adrenal
glands, testicles, and ovaries.


Hormones may cause breast cancer to
grow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body
from making hormones or it will block what
hormones do in the body. This can slow tumor
growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time.

Ovarian ablation uses radiation to
permanently stop the ovaries from making
hormones.
Ovarian suppression uses drugs to
temporarily stop the ovaries from making
hormones. It is achieved with drugs called
LHRH agonists. These drugs stop LHRH
from being made, which stops the ovaries
from making hormones. LHRH agonists
include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide
(Lupron Depot). Gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH) agonists might be
used to suppress ovarian hormone or
testosterone production.
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) stop a
type of hormone called androgen from
changing into estrogen by interfering with
an enzyme called aromatase. They do
not affect estrogen made by the ovaries.
Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors include
anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole
(Femara). Exemestane (Aromasin) is a
steroidal aromatase inhibitor.
Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators
or anti-estrogens prevent hormones from
binding to receptors. SERMs and SERDs
are types of ER modulators.
•

Endocrine therapy is sometimes called
hormone therapy. It is not the same as
hormone replacement therapy used for
menopause.
•

There is one type of surgical endocrine
therapy:


Bilateral oophorectomy is surgery to
remove both ovaries.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Inflammatory Breast Cancer, 2023

40

Selective estrogen receptor
modulators (SERMs) block estrogen
from attaching to hormone receptors.
They include tamoxifen and toremifene
(Fareston).
Selective estrogen receptor
degraders (SERDs) block and destroy
estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant
(Faslodex) and elacestrant (Orserdu)
are SERDs.

Treating IBC » Endocrine therapy





Testosterone

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) agonists might be used
to suppress ovarian hormone or
testosterone production.

For those assigned male at birth whose bodies
continue to make testosterone, endocrine
therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase
inhibitor with testosterone-suppressing
therapy.

Hormones may be used to treat breast
cancer when taken in high doses. It is
not known how hormones stop breast
cancer from growing. They include ethinyl
estradiol, fluoxymesterone, and megestrol
acetate (Megace ES).

Premenopause
If you have menstrual periods, you are
in premenopause. In premenopause, the
ovaries are the main source of estrogen and
progesterone. Menstrual periods may stop
during treatment (called amenorrhea) and for
up to 2 years after treatment, but often return
in those 35 years of age and under.

Those who want to have children in the future
should be referred to a fertility specialist before
starting endocrine therapy to discuss the
options.

or ablation is frequently considered for higher
risk ER+ breast cancers.

Tamoxifen is the endocrine treatment for those
in premenopause. Ovarian suppression or
ablation is frequently considered for higher risk
ER+ breast cancers.

Bone-strengthening therapy

Menopause

Medicines that target the bones may be given
to help relieve bone pain or reduce the risk
of bone problems. Some medicines work by
slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while
others help increase bone thickness.

In menopause, the ovaries permanently stop
producing hormones and menstrual periods
stop. Estrogen and progesterone levels are
low, but, the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat
continue to make small amounts of estrogen.
If you don’t have periods, a test using a blood
sample may be used to confirm your status.

When breast cancer spreads to distant sites,
it may metastasize in your bones. This puts
your bones at risk for injury and disease. Such
problems include bone loss (osteoporosis),
fractures, bone pain, and squeezing
(compression) of the spinal cord. Some
treatments for breast cancer, like aromatase
inhibitors or GnRH agonists, can cause bone
loss, which put you at an increased risk for
fractures.

Cancer treatment can cause a temporary
menopause.
Tamoxifen is the endocrine treatment for those
in premenopause. GnRH agonists may be
used to temporarily induce menopause for
those in premenopause. Combination of GnRH
agonists and tamoxifen/aromatase inhibitors
may be considered as endocrine therapy for
those in premenopause. Ovarian suppression

and jaw. Osteonecrosis, or bone tissue death
of the jaw, is a rare but serious side effect. Tell
your care team about any planned trips to the
dentist and surgeries or dental procedures
that might also affect the jaw bone. It will be
important to take care of your teeth and to see
a dentist before starting treatment with any of
these drugs.

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

You will be screened for bone weakness
(osteoporosis) using a bone mineral density
test. This measures how much calcium and
other minerals are in your bones. It is also
called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DEXA) scan and is painless. Bone mineral
density tests look for osteoporosis and help
predict your risk for bone fractures.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

A baseline DEXA scan is recommended before
starting endocrine therapy.

Zoledronic acid, pamidronate,
and denosumab

Phases

Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab
are used to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis)
and fractures. Zoledronic acid and denosumab
are also used in those with metastatic
breast cancer who have bone metastases
to help reduce the likelihood of fractures,
pain, or other complications arising from
cancer in bone. ou might have blood tests to
monitor kidney function, calcium levels, and
magnesium levels. A calcium and vitamin D
supplement will be recommended by your
doctor.

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.

Treating IBC » Supportive care

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

It is important to tell
your care team about
all side effects so they
can be managed.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.
Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
Rarely. It depends on the study, your health
insurance, and the state in which you live.
In general, procedures, drugs, or tests that
are considered standard of care will be billed
to you or your insurance, whereas those
considered research are covered by the trial
sponsor. Your treatment team and the research
team can help determine if you are responsible
for any costs.

Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

Supportive care

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Supportive care might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you are
feeling and about any side effects so they can
be managed. Best supportive care, supportive
care, and palliative care are often used
interchangeably.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner

It is very important to take care of yourself by

Treating IBC » Side effects

Bone health

late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

Breast cancer may spread to your bones.
Some breast cancer treatments may also
weaken your bones. Both can put your bones
at increased risk for injury and disease. Such
problems include bone fractures, bone pain,
and squeezing (compression) of the spinal
cord. High levels of calcium in the blood, called
hypercalcemia, may also occur.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. When treatment
leads to remission (or no evidence of disease),
you will need follow-up or survivorship care for
late effects. During survivorship care you will
still have a care team, but it will look different.
Seek out peer support groups, whether online
or in-person.

Medicine may be given to help relieve bone
pain and reduce the risk of other bone
problems. Some medicines work by slowing or
stopping bone breakdown, while others help
increase bone thickness. It is recommended
that you take calcium and vitamin D with these
bone health medicines. Talk to your doctor first.

Side effects
Blood clots

Diarrhea

Cancer or cancer treatment can cause blood
clots to form. This can block blood flow and
oxygen in the body. Blood clots can break
loose and travel to other parts of the body
causing stroke or other health issues. Venous
thromboembolism (VTE) refers to blood clots
in the veins.

Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how to
manage diarrhea. It is important to drink lots of
fluids.

Difficulty eating
Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or its treatment might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating

is important during treatment. It includes eating
a balanced diet, eating the right amount of
food, and drinking enough fluids. A registered
dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food
can help. Speak to your care team if you have
trouble eating or maintaining weight.

Keep a pain diary
A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicine that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Include in your pain diary:

3 The time and dose of all medicines
3 When pain starts and ends or lessens
3 Where you feel pain
3 A description of your pain. Is it

Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia)
all over your body — not just on your scalp.
Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely
than others to cause hair loss. Dosage might
also affect the amount of hair loss. Most of
the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is
temporary. Hair often regrows 3 to 6 months
after treatment ends. Your hair may be a
different shade or texture. Scalp cooling
(or scalp hypothermia) might help lessen
hair loss in those receiving certain types of
chemotherapy.

recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of
your brain affects your thinking and behavior.
Neuropsychological testing can identify your
limits and a health care professional can
create a plan to help with these limits.

Anemia is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to
your cells. You might tire easily if you are
anemic.
Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infection.
Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Neuropathy
Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment. Most of the
time, neuropathy goes away after treatment.

Lymphedema
Lymphedema is a condition in which extra
lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes
swelling (edema). It may occur when part of
the lymph system is damaged or blocked,
such as during surgery to remove lymph
nodes or due to radiation therapy. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression sleeves, and
other means. Ask your care team about the
ways to treat lymphedema.

Organ issues
Treatment might cause your kidneys, liver,
heart, and pancreas to not work as well as
they should.

Pain
Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain.

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

IBC is treated with systemic therapy
to shrink the tumor, followed by a
mastectomy, and radiation therapy.
Surgery is not always possible. Even
though surgery might not be an option,
systemic therapy will continue. Systemic
treatment is based on estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and
HER2 expression.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays (photons, electrons),
protons, and other sources to kill cancer
cells.
Some breast cancers grow because of
estrogen. These cancers are estrogen
receptor-positive (ER+) and are often
treated with endocrine therapy to reduce
the risk of cancer recurrence.
A clinical trial is a type of research that
studies a treatment to see how safe it is
and how well it works.
Supportive care is health care that
relieves symptoms caused by treatment
and improves quality of life. Supportive
care is always given.
All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important for you to tell your
care team about all your side effects so
they can be managed.
Eating a balanced diet, drinking enough
fluids, exercise, yoga, and massage
therapy can help manage side effects.

Overview

3 Perioperative therapy is systemic

therapy, such as chemotherapy, given
before and after surgery.

Since IBC spreads quickly, treatment starts
with systemic therapy to stop the spread of
cancer. If the cancer responds to treatment,
then surgery is performed to remove the
breast and lymph nodes (modified radical
mastectomy) for those assigned female at
birth with stage 3 cancer. This is followed
by radiation to the chest wall. If you choose
breast reconstruction after a mastectomy with
radiation, then delayed breast reconstruction is
recommended. Radiation can slow the healing
process. Therefore, delayed reconstruction
is recommended after all the healing from
radiation is done.

3 Primary treatment is the main
treatment given to rid the body of
cancer.

3 Postoperative or adjuvant (after)

therapy is given after primary
treatment to rid the body of any cancer
cells left behind from surgery. It is also
used when the risk of cancer returning

of treatment given if cancer progresses
during or after systemic therapy.

Treatment for IBC starts with preoperative
systemic therapy. Preoperative therapy is
treatment given before surgery. It is based
on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)
and HER2 in your tumor cells. Cancer can still
progress during preoperative systemic therapy.

A physical exam and imaging tests should be
done to assess how the cancer responded to
preoperative systemic therapy. Treatment will
be based on if the tumor can be removed with
surgery or if the tumor did not shrink enough to
be removed with surgery.

Supportive care aims
to prevent, reduce, and
relieve side effects and
to improve quality of
life.

Surgery is an option
If surgery is possible, then a total mastectomy
with level I and II axillary lymph node
dissection is the recommended option.
Because IBC usually involves a substantial
portion of the breast, lumpectomy is not
typically an option. You may choose a
delayed breast reconstruction as part of the
mastectomy. Radiation therapy (RT) is part of
this treatment.

Surgery is not an option

If the tumor is HER2+, then you will complete
up to one year of HER2-targeted therapy. This
may be given with RT and endocrine therapy.

Surgery is not always possible. Even though
surgery might not be an option, systemic
therapy will continue. If the cancer is not
responding to systemic therapy, then radiation
may be considered to try to make the
cancer resectable (able to be removed with
surgery). The goal of treatment is to reduce
the amount of cancer. Talk with your care
team about your goals of treatment and your
treatment preferences. Your wishes are always
important.

Endocrine therapy is used to treat tumors that
are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and/or

The look of your breast after
mastectomy will depend on

In a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the
entire breast, including nipple, extra skin,
fat, and other tissue in the breast area are
removed. The remaining skin is tightened
and sewn together. No breast mound is
created and no implant is added. The scar
will be slightly raised and differ in color than
the surrounding skin. A flat closure is not
completely flat or smooth. The end result
varies from person to person. Ask to look at

The recovery time for each procedure differs.
This can affect your ability to return to work
or participate in activities. You might consider
speaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery
to discuss your options and what to expect.
If breast construction is something you might

Breast reconstruction

Flaps

Breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild
the shape and look of the breast after
a mastectomy. In many cases, breast
reconstruction involves a staged approach.
It might require more than one procedure. If
breast construction is something you might
want, delayed reconstruction is recommended
in those with IBC. Delayed reconstruction can
occur months or years after mastectomy. A
plastic surgeon performs breast reconstruction.

Breasts can be remade using tissue from other
parts of your body, known as flaps. These flaps
are taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh,
or from under the shoulder blade. Some flaps
are completely removed and then sewn in
place. Other flaps stay attached to your body
but are slid over and sewn into place.
There are several risks associated with flaps,
including death of fat in the flap, which can
cause lumps. A hernia may result from muscle
weakness. Problems are more likely to occur
among those who have diabetes or who
smoke.

Breasts can be reconstructed with implants
and flaps. All methods are generally safe,
but as with any surgery, there are risks. Ask
your treatment team for a complete list of side
effects.

Implants and flaps
Some breasts are reconstructed with both
implants and flaps. This method may give the
reconstructed breast more volume to match
the other breast. For any reconstruction, you
may need surgery on your remaining breast to
match the two breasts in size and shape.

Implants
Breast implants are small bags filled with salt
water, silicone gel, or both. They are placed
under the breast skin or muscle to look like a
new breast following a mastectomy. A balloonlike device, called an expander, may be used
first to stretch out tissue. It will be placed under
your skin or muscle and enlarged every few
weeks for two to three months. When your skin
is stretched to the proper size, you will have
surgery to place the final implant.

Nipple replacement
Like your breast, a nipple can be remade. To
rebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use
surrounding tissues. Also, nipples can be
remade with tissue from the thigh or the other
nipple. Tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to
look more like a nipple. It is important to note
that while you can remake something to look
like a nipple, it will not have the sensation of
your real nipple. Also, a tattoo can be done to
look like a nipple without having to take tissue
from another part of the body.

Implants have a small risk of leaking or
causing other issues. You may feel pain from
the implant or expander. Scar tissue or tissue
death can occur. Textured implants can cause
breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell
lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a type of cancer.

The breast after surgery » What to consider

What to consider
If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit

Some things to consider when deciding
to have flat closure or reconstruction after
mastectomy:










Your desire – You may have a strong
feeling towards flat closure or one form
of reconstruction after being given the
options. Breast reconstruction should be
a shared decision between you and your
care team. Make your wishes known.

Smoking or vaping nicotine greatly
increases your chances of having side
effects during and after surgery. Smoking
and vaping can limit how well cancer
treatment works and prevent wound
healing. They also increase your chances
of developing other cancers. Marijuana
use might also affect the amount of
anesthesia used during surgery.

Health issues – You may have health
issues such as diabetes or a blood
disorder that might affect or delay healing,
or make longer procedures unsafe.
Tobacco use – Smoking delays wound
healing and can cause mastectomy flap
death (necrosis), nipple-areola complex
(NAC) necrosis in a nipple-sparing
mastectomy, infection, and failure of
implant-based reconstruction. In free flap
reconstruction, smoking increases the risk
of complications. You are encouraged to
stop smoking prior to reconstruction.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that
makes you want to keep smoking and
vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging
for most people who smoke or vape. The
stress of having cancer may make it even
harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask
your care team about counseling and
medicines to help you quit.

Breast size and shape – There are
limits to the available sizes of breast
implants. Very large breasts or breasts
that lack tone or droop (called ptosis)
might be difficult to match. Breast
reduction surgery might be an option.

For online support, try these websites:

Body mass index (BMI) – Those with
an elevated BMI have an increased risk of
infections and complications with breast
reconstruction.
