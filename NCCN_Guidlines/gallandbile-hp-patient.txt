Gallbladder and bile duct cancer basics » The hepatobiliary system

The liver, gallbladder, and bile

Bile ducts and bile

ducts work together to make,

Liver cells make bile. Bile is a yellow or green
fluid made up of cholesterol, bilirubin, salts
such as potassium and sodium, water, and
other elements found in the body. Bile flows
into small channels that drain into thin tubes
called ducts. These ducts form larger and
larger channels that flow into the left and

store, and secrete bile. Bile is
a fluid that helps digest fat in
the food you eat. Together, the
gallbladder and bile ducts are
known as the biliary tract and are
part of the hepatobiliary system.

The hepatobiliary system
The hepatobiliary system includes the
liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. It is part
of the digestive system.

The hepatobiliary system
“Hepato” means liver and “biliary” refers to the
gallbladder and bile ducts. Together, they form
the hepatobiliary system. The hepatobiliary
system makes bile and is a part of the
digestive system. The digestive system takes
in food, breaks it down, absorbs nutrients, and
removes waste from the body.

The gallbladder
The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped
organ found under the liver. It is sometimes
described as sac-like because it holds bile
from the liver. Bile is made by the liver and
stored in the gallbladder, and when you eat,
it then passes through the bile ducts into the
small intestine to help digest food. You do not
need your gallbladder to eat or live normally.

outside the liver. Intrahepatic and hilar
bile ducts carry bile between the liver and
gallbladder. Bile leaves the liver through
the left and right hepatic ducts. These
together join to form the common hepatic
duct. Bile then travels up the cystic duct
and into the gallbladder for temporary
storage between meals.

right hepatic (liver) ducts. The left and right
hepatic ducts join to form the common hepatic
bile duct. The common hepatic duct joins
with the cystic duct to form the common bile
duct. The common bile duct is joined by the
pancreatic duct just before it enters the small
intestine. The common bile duct carries bile
to the first part of the small intestine called
the duodenum. In the small intestine, the bile
and other fluids break down food to allow your
small intestine to absorb nutrients and send
waste to your large intestine, also known as
the colon.



A more in-depth explanation of how bile travels
through the bile ducts is described next.


Intrahepatic bile ducts of varying
sizes are found inside your liver. Hilar
bile ducts are the main bile ducts just

Bile duct anatomy
The left and right hepatic ducts
join to form the common hepatic
duct. The common hepatic duct
joins with the cystic duct to
form the common bile duct. The
common bile duct is joined by
the pancreatic duct just before
it enters the small intestine
(duodenum).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

The cystic and common bile ducts
carry bile from the gallbladder to the small
intestine. Bile leaves the gallbladder
through the cystic duct where it connects
to the common bile duct. The common
bile duct is joined by the pancreatic duct
inside the pancreas just before it enters
the small intestine.

Gallbladder cancer

During pathology review

Gallbladder cancer is a rare cancer that can
grow and spread quickly. Not all gallbladder
cancers are the same. Adenocarcinoma is
the most common type of gallbladder cancer.
An adenocarcinoma is cancer in the cells that
secrete fluids or other substances. Other rare
types of cancer can grow in the wall of the
gallbladder. Gallbladder adenocarcinoma is the
type of cancer described in this book.

It is common for a pathologist to review all
tissue that has been removed during surgery.
A pathologist is an expert in examining cells
under a microscope to find disease. Often,
gallbladder cancers are found during pathology
review of a condition that was originally felt to
be non-cancerous.

How gallbladder cancer is found

A mass or tumor might be found on imaging
tests done for other reasons. Cancer is
confirmed by biopsy or during surgery.

On imaging tests

Gallbladder cancer is often found by chance.
This is called an incidental finding. For
example, a tumor in the gallbladder may be
found on an ultrasound being done for other
reasons. Since gallbladder cancer doesn’t
always have symptoms and it spreads quickly,
it is usually found in an advanced stage.
Gallbladder cancer can be found in 3 ways:





During surgery
During pathology review after removal of
the gallbladder for what was thought to be
gallstone-related conditions
On imaging tests

During surgery
Some gallbladder cancers are found during
abdominal (belly) surgery for something
other than gallbladder cancer. This could
be for treatment for suspected gallstones
(cholelithiasis) or inflammation of the
gallbladder (cholecystitis). Gallstones are
hardened deposits of bile.

Gallbladder and bile duct cancer basics » Bile duct cancers

Bile duct cancers

There are 2 subtypes of extrahepatic bile duct
cancer:

The bile ducts carry bile from the liver to
the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to
the small intestine. Cholangiocarcinoma,
also known as bile duct cancer, is a type
of adenocarcinoma. An adenocarcinoma is
cancer in the cells that secrete fluids or other
substances.







Intrahepatic bile duct cancers start
in the bile ducts found inside the liver.
Extrahepatic bile duct cancers
grow in the bile ducts outside the liver.

Gallbladder and bile ducts
The bile ducts carry bile from
the liver to the gallbladder and
from the gallbladder to the
small intestine.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

Distal bile duct cancer is found in the
common bile duct.

Cancer that forms in the ampulla of Vater
(ducts from the liver and pancreas that enter at
the small intestine) is not covered in this book.

There are 2 types of cholangiocarcinomas:


Hilar bile duct cancer (Klatskin
tumors) is found in the common hepatic
duct.

How cancer spreads

Key points

Unlike normal cells, cancer cells can spread
and form tumors in other parts of the body.
Cancer that has spread is called a metastasis.





Cancer can spread through the blood and
lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is
made up of a network of vessels that carry
a clear fluid called lymph. Lymph gives cells
water and food, and it has white blood cells
that fight germs. Lymph nodes filter lymph and
remove the germs.







Gallbladder cancer most commonly spreads
into nearby lymph nodes or organs, such as
the pancreas, bile ducts, or liver.
Bile duct cancers can grow into nearby blood
vessels, organs, and other structures. It might
also grow into nearby lymphatic or blood
vessels, and from there spread to nearby
lymph nodes or to other parts of the body.

The liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts are
part of the hepatobiliary system.
The biliary tract includes the gallbladder
and bile ducts inside and outside the liver.
Cancers in the bile ducts or gallbladder
are known as biliary tract cancers.
Gallbladder cancer is the most common
type of biliary tract cancer worldwide.
Adenocarcinoma is the most common
type of gallbladder cancer. An
adenocarcinoma is cancer in the cells that
secrete fluids or other substances.
The bile ducts carry bile from the
liver to the gallbladder and from the
gallbladder to the small intestine.
Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile
duct cancer, starts in the bile ducts.
Cancer can spread to distant parts of
the body through the blood or lymphatic
system.

Treatment planning starts with



testing. This chapter presents an
overview of the tests you might
receive and what to expect.

Test results



Results from blood tests, imaging studies,
and biopsy will be used to determine your
treatment plan. Treatment will be based on
these findings. It is important you understand
what these tests mean. Ask questions and
keep copies of your test results. Online patient
portals are a great way to access your test
results.









Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
(OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you
take. Some supplements interact and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.
Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.

Liver disease history

Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

In your contact list, include information on
your exact type of cancer, as well as any
treatments and the date each treatment
started. Also, include information about
any metal stents, foreign body parts or
devices, and any wallet-sized ID cards
that might be given to you at the time of
some procedures.

General health tests

Keep these things in mind:


Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.
They are great partners in your care.

You might be asked about conditions that
affect the health of the liver such as cirrhosis,
hepatitis B or C virus or infection, episodes
of jaundice, gallstones, alcohol use, and fatty
liver disease.
11

Testing for gallbladder and bile duct cancers » General health tests » Blood tests

Blood tests

Family history
Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your health care provider will ask
about the health history of family members
who are blood relatives. This information is
called a family history. Ask family members
on both sides of your family about their
health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific
type of cancer or where the cancer started, if it
is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic
testing.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein. Some
blood tests are described next.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures
the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in
your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells fight
infection, and platelets control bleeding.

Physical exam

Comprehensive metabolic panel

During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:


A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures 14 different substances in your
blood. It is usually done on the plasma part
of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.

Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat



Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.







Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a waste
product filtered out of the blood by the
kidneys. A high level of BUN can be a
sign your kidneys aren’t working well.
Creatinine is a waste product produced in
the muscles. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys and tells how well the
kidneys are working.

Liver function panel
Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that
are made or processed by the liver. Levels
that are too high or low signal that the liver
is not working well or the bile ducts might be
blocked.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

12

Testing for gallbladder and bile duct cancers » Blood tests » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

One of the LFTs measured is bilirubin, a
chemical that gives bile its color. There may
be too much bilirubin in the blood if a tumor
is blocking a bile duct and preventing the free
flow of bile from the liver into the intestines or
the liver is not working as well as it should. Too
much bilirubin causes a yellowing of the eyes
and skin called jaundice. It might cause itchy
skin and dark-colored urine.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Images can be made with scanning
machines or scoping tools. Imaging tests may
show if the tumor involves any veins, arteries,
and other organs or if there is a blocked bile
duct.
A radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report to
your health care provider (HCP). It is likely that
the report will be sent directly to you through
your patient portal or patient access system.
You should discuss these results with your HCP.

Hepatitis panel
Hepatitis is a type of liver disease. Viruses
called hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C
(HCV) are the most common chronic types of
hepatitis. A hepatitis panel is a blood test that
checks to see if you have a hepatitis infection
caused by either of these viruses. Chronic
(long-term) hepatitis B and a current or past
infection with hepatitis C increase the risk for
liver cancer and biliary tract cancers. Hepatitis
causes the liver to become inflamed and not
work as it should. HBV can cause scarring of
the liver, liver failure, and cancer.

You will have some, but not all the following
tests.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that help
enhance and improve the images of several
organs and structures in the body. It is used to
make the pictures clearer. The contrast is not
permanent and will leave the body in your urine
immediately after the test. The types of contrast
vary and are different for computed tomography
(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

A hepatitis panel will tell your treatment team
if you had hepatitis in the past or if you have it
today. You may be referred to a hepatologist
if you test positive. A hepatologist is a doctor
who specializes in the care of the liver, biliary
tract, gallbladder, and pancreas.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well. Being
allergic to one type of contrast does not mean
you are allergic to all types of contrast agents
or dyes.

Tumor markers in the blood
Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9),
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and alphafetoprotein (AFP) are examples of tumor
markers that are occasionally made by tumors
and can be detected in the blood. These
tests are only one piece of information your
treatment team might consider. Not all cancers
make these markers and not every person’s
body makes these markers.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

13

Testing for gallbladder and bile duct cancers » Imaging tests

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your chest,
abdomen, and/or pelvis may be one of the
tests to look for cancer. In most cases, contrast
will be used.

Testing takes time. It
might take days or
weeks before all test
results come in.

Dynamic CT scan
In a dynamic CT scan, there are two scans:
one without contrast and one with contrast.
First, a scan is done without contrast. Then,
contrast is injected into a vein and another
scan is done.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

Multiphasic CT scan
A multiphasic CT scan is similar to a dynamic
CT scan. It starts without contrast. Then
contrast is added and multiple sets of pictures
are taken as the contrast moves through the
arteries and veins of the liver and bile ducts.
This allows your care team to see whether the
tumor involves any veins, arteries, or organs.

Dynamic MRI scan
In a dynamic MRI scan, there are two scans:
one without contrast and one with contrast.
First, a scan is done without contrast. Then,
contrast is injected into a vein and another
scan is done.

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

MRCP
A magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a type of
MRI scan that makes very clear pictures of the
pancreas and bile ducts. No contrast is used
because bile and other fluids act as their own
contrast. An MRCP is usually done with an
MRI scan.

14

Testing for gallbladder and bile duct cancers » Imaging tests

PTC

PET scan

A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
(PTC) uses contrast and an x-ray to take
pictures of the biliary tract. This procedure
is usually performed by an interventional
radiologist, doctor who specializes in small
procedures using x-rays, ultrasound, or other
types of imaging. A needle or small catheter
(thin, flexible tube) is placed through the skin
(percutaneous) into a bile duct and contrast is
injected. Then, x-rays that use small amounts
of radiation are taken to make pictures of
the bile ducts. If necessary, a catheter can
be inserted to drain fluid from the biliary tract
into a bag outside the body or into the small
intestine. A metal stent may also be placed for
an obstruction or blocked bile duct.

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive sugar molecule called a
tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a
vein to see where cancer spots might be in
the body and if they are using sugar produced
by your body to grow. Cancer spots show up
as bright areas on PET scans. However, not
all tumors will appear on a PET scan and not
all bright spots are cancer. It is normal for the
brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright
on the PET scan. Inflammation or infection can
also show up as a bright spot. When a PET
scan is combined with CT, it is called a PETCT scan.

For this test, you will be given medicine to help
you feel relaxed. Plastic catheters are often
placed during the procedure. If so, you and
your caregiver will learn how to care for these
catheters.

An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer)
will be held and moved on your skin using
gel. Ultrasound is painless and does not use

Ultrasound

CT machine
A CT machine is large and
has a tunnel in the middle.
During the test, you will lie on
the table that moves slowly
through the tunnel.

Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

15

Testing for gallbladder and bile duct cancers » Scoping procedures

x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed.
Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of
cancer that are near the skin. Sometimes, an
ultrasound is used to guide a biopsy.

Sometimes, an EUS can detect small lesions
in the liver or pancreas that are difficult to see
on a CT or MRI scan. It might be used to get a
closer look at your bile ducts.

A contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) might
be used in addition to other tests. Contrast
is injected into a vein and another US is
performed.

An EUS is done under sedation to keep you
comfortable during the procedure. It might be
done with an ERCP.

Scoping procedures

An endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) uses an
endoscope and x-rays to take moving pictures
of the inside of the body. For this test, the
endoscope will be inserted through your mouth
and guided down your throat and stomach to
the duodenum. Next, a thinner tube called a
catheter will be passed through the middle of
the endoscope. The catheter will be used to
inject a contrast material into the liver and bile
ducts. The contrast material allows the ducts to
be clearly seen on the x-ray pictures.

ERCP

Some imaging tests use a thin, tube-shaped
tool called a scope (or endoscope) that is
inserted into the body to take pictures. One
end of the scope has a small light and camera
lens to see inside your body. The image is sent
to a television monitor. This will help guide
your doctor in a biopsy, stent placement, or
other tasks.
The scope is guided into the body through a
natural opening, such as the mouth, nose, or
anus. It may also be inserted through a small
surgical cut.

An ERCP is used to open a blocked bile duct
caused by a tumor in the liver, bile duct, or
pancreas. During an ERCP, biopsy samples
may be taken from the common bile duct.
Samples are removed with a small brush at
the end of the endoscope. These samples are
called brushings. Brushings are taken before
stent placement.

More than one type of scope may be used for
imaging tests. The type of scope often used for
gallbladder and bile duct cancer is called an
endoscope. An endoscope is often guided into
the body through the mouth.
Some scoping procedures are described next.

An ERCP is done under sedation to keep you
comfortable during the procedure. It might be
done with an EUS.

Endoscopic ultrasound
An EUS uses an endoscope that has a
small ultrasound (US) probe at the end. The
endoscope is inserted through your mouth and
guided down your throat into your stomach
and then the first part of the small intestine
(duodenum). The ultrasound probe bounces
sound waves off your liver and other organs to
make pictures of the inside of your body.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

Upper GI endoscopy or EGD
In an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy
or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), an
endoscope is guided down the throat into the
esophagus, stomach, and upper parts of the
small intestine (duodenum). An EGD is used to
inspect the lining of these organs and to look for

any signs of cancer or other abnormalities such
as enlarged blood vessels or ulcers. An EGD
can also be referred to as a duodenoscopy.

A biopsy is a procedure that removes samples
of fluid or tissue. A biopsy can be negative
when cancer is present.

Laparoscopy

Types of possible biopsies include:

Laparoscopy (key-hole surgery) is a type of
surgical procedure that allows your surgeon to
see the inside of your abdomen without using
a large incision. It uses a tool like a special
endoscope called a laparoscope. For this test,
the laparoscope will be inserted through a tiny
cut (incision) in your abdomen. Laparoscopy
is done under general anesthesia. This is a
controlled loss of wakefulness from drugs.
A breathing tube is usually used during this
operation.







Laparoscopy may only be used in certain
cases. It can be used to








Stage the disease.
Rule out metastasis by detecting cancer
spread inside your abdomen, which may
have been missed on imaging scans.
Obtain biopsy samples.

Brushings are tumor or cell samples
removed with a small brush at the end of
the endoscope, usually during an ERCP
procedure.
Fluid samples from ascites (fluid in
abdominal cavity) can be used to look for
cancer cells.
Core needle biopsy removes tissue
samples with a hollow needle about
the same size as a needle used for an
intravenous (IV) line. An ultrasound or
CT scan may help the radiologist find the
area to biopsy.

The biopsy samples will be sent to a
pathologist, an expert in examining cells under
a microscope to find disease. A sample of your
tumor will be tested to look for biomarkers or
proteins. This information is used to choose
the best treatment for you. It is sometimes
called molecular testing.

Determine if you are a candidate for
surgery.

Colonoscopy
In a colonoscopy, the endoscope is used to
examine the inside of the colon. A colonoscope
has a light and a lens for viewing and may
have a tool to remove tissue. It is guided
through the anus, then into the rectum and the
colon. A colonoscopy is done under sedation
to keep you comfortable during the procedure.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or fineneedle biopsy (FNB) uses a thin needle
to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. An
ultrasound (US) may guide the FNA biopsy.

Biomarker testing

(microsatellite instability-high). This is often
due to dMMR genes.

A sample from a biopsy of your tumor may be
tested to look for specific DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) mutations, protein levels, or other
molecular features. It is sometimes called
molecular testing or tumor profile testing.

Genetic risk testing
Depending on your family history or other
features of your cancer, your health care
provider might refer you for hereditary genetic
testing to learn more about your cancer. A
genetic counselor or trained provider will speak
to you about the results. Tests results may be
used to guide treatment planning. The test
results may also help guide further testing for
your family members.

CA 19-9, CEA, and AFP
Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9),
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and alphafetoprotein (AFP) are examples of tumor
markers that are occasionally made by tumors
and can be detected in the blood.

Tumor mutation testing

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). The
goal is to look for gene mutations inherited
from your biological parents called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You
can pass these genes on to your children.
Also, other family members might carry these
mutations. Tell your care team if there is a
family history of cancer.

Tumor mutation testing or molecular profiling
uses a sample of your tumor or blood to
see if the cancer cells have any specific
mutations. Some mutations such as NTRK
gene fusion, BRAF V600E, FGFR2 fusion
or rearrangement, IDH1, HER2 (ERBB2)
overexpression and/or amplification, and RET
gene fusion can be targeted with specific
therapies. When a tumor has a high number of
mutations, it is referred to as tumor mutational
burden-high (TMB-H). Tumor mutation testing
is different than genetic testing for mutations
that you may have inherited from your
biological parents.

BRCA tests
Everyone has BRCA genes. Normal BRCA
genes help to prevent tumor growth. They help
fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally.
BRCA mutations put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. Mutations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian,
prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma
skin cancers. Mutated BRCA genes can also
affect how well some treatments work.

MSI-H/dMMR mutation
Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of
DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are
fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.
Some cancers have DNA mutations for
changes that prevent these errors from being
fixed. This is called microsatellite instability
(MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).
When cancer cells have more than a normal
number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H

decisions. It describes the size
and location of the tumor and

the body.



How cancer is staged



A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging.







Gallbladder carcinoma



Intrahepatic bile duct tumors (intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma)
Perihilar bile duct tumors (extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma), also known as
Klatskin tumor

Grade of the cancer (G): How much
do the cancer cells look like normal cells?
Biomarker and mutation testing:
Does the cancer have any genes,
proteins, markers, or mutations that might
suggest treatment?

Anatomic – based on extent of cancer
as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node
status (N), and distant metastasis (M).
Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM
plus tumor grade and the status of the
biomarkers or mutations. The prognostic
stage also includes the assumption that
you are treated with the standard-of-care
approaches.

Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and
pathologic. Clinical stage (c) is the rating given
before any treatment. It is based on a physical
exam, biopsy, and imaging tests. An example

AJCC staging is used for the following
cancers:



The spread to nearby lymph nodes
(N): Has the cancer spread to nearby
lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where?

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins. Your care team
may explain your cancer stage in different
ways than described next.

Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A
prognosis is the course your cancer will likely
take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.

The extent (size) of the tumor (T):
How large is the cancer? Has it grown
into nearby areas?

Grade

might look like cT3. Pathologic stage (p) or
surgical stage is determined by examining
tissue removed during surgery. An example
might be pT3. If you are given drug therapy
before surgery, then the stage might look like
ypT3. Staging after surgery provides more
specific and accurate details about the size of
the cancer and lymph node status.

Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells
look under a microscope (called histology).
Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread
faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means
the grade can’t be determined, followed by
G1, G2, and G3. Well differentiated means the
cancer cells look similar to normal cells. Poorly
differentiated means the cancer cells look very
different compared to normal cells.

TNM scores
The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage gallbladder and bile duct cancers.
In this system, the letters T, N, and M describe
different areas of cancer growth. Based on
cancer test results, a score or number will be
given to each letter. The higher the number,
the larger the tumor or the more the cancer
has spread. These scores will be combined
to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM example
might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M0.






GX – Grade cannot be determined



G1 – Well differentiated



G2 – Moderately differentiated



G3 – Poorly differentiated

Numbered stages
Numbered stages are based on TNM scores.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with
4 being the most advanced. They might be
written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III,
and stage IV.

T (tumor) – Size of the main (primary)
tumor
N (node) – If cancer has spread to

Gallbladder cancer stages

T = Tumor

Gallbladder cancer is staged by how much
the tumor has grown into the layers of the
gallbladder wall and if the tumor is on the
side nearest to the liver (hepatic) or the small
intestine (peritoneal). It can be difficult to
determine the exact location of the tumor.
Cancer can spread beyond the visible tumor
making it difficult to find. Staging for cancer in
lymph nodes is based on the number of lymph
nodes rather than their location.

Carcinoma in situ (Tis) is the earliest stage
of gallbladder cancer. Cancer cells are
found inside the lining of the gallbladder wall
(epithelium). Cancer has not grown into any
other layers of the gallbladder. Gallbladder
cancers are rarely found this early.

will have multiple treatments at
different times. This is called
multidisciplinary care. This
chapter describes treatment
options and what to expect.
Together, you and your care team
will choose a treatment plan that

Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout cancer treatment, while others

Surgery

tissue around the tumor. If there is a positive
margin, you may require another surgery to try
to remove the remaining tumor cells. Surgery
includes removal of lymph nodes.

Surgery is a primary treatment for gallbladder
and bile duct cancers. Primary treatment is the
main treatment used to rid the body of cancer.
The goal of surgery is to remove all of the
cancer, or to remove as much as possible so
other treatments may be given. Surgery can
also provide supportive care by easing pain
or discomfort or to extend life. This is called
palliative surgery.

Open surgery
Open surgery or laparotomy removes tissue
through one large surgical cut below your
ribs. The large cut lets the surgeon directly
view and access the tumor to remove it. Open
surgery may take several hours or longer.
After the surgery, you will need to stay in the
hospital to recover.

When preparing for surgery, seek the opinion
of an experienced surgeon. The surgeon
should be an expert in performing your type of
surgery. Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating your type of cancer.

Minimally invasive surgery
Minimally invasive surgery (or key-hole
surgery) uses several small incisions or cuts.
Small tools are inserted through each incision
to perform the surgery. One of the tools, called
a laparoscope, is a long tube with a video
camera at the end. The camera lets your
surgeon see your gallbladder and other tissues
inside your abdomen. Other tools are used to
remove the tumor. Laparoscopic surgery can
also be done using robotic arms to control the
surgical tools. This is called robot-assisted
laparoscopic surgery.

The removal of the cancer through surgery can
be accomplished in different ways depending
on the specific circumstances, such as the
size and location of the tumor, and if there is
cancer in any surrounding organs and tissues.
Surgery is based on the safest and best way to
remove the cancer.
You might have more than one surgery. You
might also have a wound drain to prevent fluid
from collecting in the body after surgery.

Cholecystectomy

Goal of surgery

A cholecystectomy removes the gallbladder
and some tissue around it. The goal is to have
negative surgical margins, which means there
is no cancer in the remaining area.

The goal of surgery or tumor resection is to
remove all of the cancer. To do so, the tumor
is removed along with a rim of normal-looking
tissue around its edge called the surgical
margin. The surgical margin may look normal
during surgery, but cancerous cells may be
found when viewed under a microscope by a
pathologist. A clear or negative margin (R0) is
when no cancer cells are found in the tissue
around the edge of the tumor. In a positive
margin, cancer cells are found in normal-looking

During a cholecystectomy, some people will
also have a hepatic resection (parts of liver
removed), lymphadenectomy (nearby lymph
nodes removed), and bile duct removal.

this might affect recovery, and what further
treatment might be needed.

Tumor resection
The removal of the tumor is called tumor
resection. Imaging tests will be used to see
if your cancer is resectable (can be removed
completely by surgery) or unresectable
(cannot be removed completely by surgery).
Sometimes, imaging tests cannot clearly show
one way or the other.

Liver transplant
In a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed
and replaced with a healthy donor liver. The
new liver may be donated from a person who
recently died or a section of liver may be
donated from a living person. A liver transplant
is based on certain tumor size limits and tumor
locations.

Liver resection (partial

of the liver. Structures such as the inferior
vena cava, portal vein, hepatic artery, and
bile ducts are reconnected to the new liver.
Remember, a liver transplant can be a whole
liver replacement or just a portion.

A Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is a
procedure that bypasses the bile duct to allow
digestive juices to drain from the liver directly
into the small intestine.

A liver transplant may be an option for
those who can’t have a partial hepatectomy.
However, not everyone is a candidate for a
liver transplant.
Other treatments may be given if you are
waiting for a transplant. These treatments are
called bridging therapy.

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit

There is still a chance that cancer will return
after a liver transplant. It is also possible your
body will reject the donor liver. You will be
given medicine to prevent rejection.

A history of smoking or vaping nicotine
increases your chances of developing lung
and other cancers. Smoking and vaping
can limit how well cancer treatment works
and prevents wound healing. It also greatly
increases your chances of having side
effects during and after surgery. Cannabis
use might also affect the amount of
anesthesia used during surgery.

Lymphadenectomy
During a lymphadenectomy, the lymph
nodes are removed and a sample of tissue
is checked under a microscope for signs of
cancer. A lymphadenectomy is sometimes
called lymph node dissection.




In a regional lymphadenectomy,
some of the lymph nodes in the tumor
area are removed.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that
makes you want to keep smoking and
vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging
for most people who smoke or vape. The
stress of having cancer may make it even
harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask
your care team about counseling and
medicines to help you quit.

In a radical lymphadenectomy, most
or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor
area are removed.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy
A pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple
procedure is surgery that removes the head
of the pancreas, gallbladder, duodenum (first
part of the small intestine), part of the bile duct,
and nearby lymph nodes. This surgery is often
used for tumors located in the mid and lower
part of the common bile duct.

Treating gallbladder and bile duct cancers » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

For a list of some systemic therapies, see

Guide 5.

Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might
be used alone or with other therapies. Goals of
systemic therapy should be discussed before
starting treatment. Your wishes about treatment
are important. Make your wishes known.






Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. Often, chemotherapies
are combined. This is called multiagent
chemotherapy. Examples include FOLFOX
and FOLFIRI. FOLFOX is a combination
of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and
oxaliplatin. FOLFIRI is a combination of 5-FU
with leucovorin and irinotecan. Chemotherapy
is also used in arterially directed therapy.

Systemic therapy given before surgery is
called neoadjuvant or preoperative
therapy.
Systemic therapy given after surgery is
called adjuvant or postoperative
therapy.
Systemic therapy is given for advanced
disease may be called palliative
therapy.

Chemoradiation
Treatment that combines chemotherapy with
radiation therapy is called chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy may improve how well radiation
works, and that is why they are sometimes
used together. Fluoropyrimidine-based
chemotherapies such as 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and capecitabine (Xeloda) are used with
radiation to treat gallbladder and bile duct
cancers. Chemoradiation may be used to
control symptoms caused by a tumor.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop or inhibit
the action of molecules that help cancer cells
grow and/or survive. If your tumor has certain
mutations, targeted therapy might be used. If
your tumor has a high number of mutations,
immunotherapy might be given.

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:


Turmeric



Ginkgo biloba



Green tea extract

Immunotherapy



St. John’s Wort

Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment
that tries to reactivate the immune system
against tumor cells. The immune system
has many on and off switches. Tumors take
advantage of "off switches." Two leading off
switches are programmed death-1 (PD-1) and
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4
(CTLA-4). Immunotherapy can be given alone
or with other types of treatment.



Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care
medicines given during systemic therapy.
Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.

Arterially directed therapy



Arterially directed therapy or embolization
includes embolization (TAE),
chemoembolization (TACE), drug-eluting
bead embolization (DEB-TACE), and
radioembolization (Y-90 or TARE). It treats
tumors by injecting particles, chemotherapy,
or radioactive beads directly into the blood
vessels that supply the tumor(s). A small
catheter is inserted into the artery and is guided
to the tumor. Once in place, the particles,
chemotherapy, or beads are injected. Arterially
directed therapy has risks. It might not be used
if your bilirubin level is above a certain level.



The common types of arterially directed
therapy include:




Transarterial embolization (TAE)
involves blocking the blood supply to
the tumor by injecting tiny particles into
the blood vessels feeding the tumor(s).
Stopping the blood flow cuts off the
oxygen supply to the tumor and causes
cancer cells to die.

DEB-TACE (drug-eluting bead
transarterial chemoembolization)
uses tiny particles loaded with
chemotherapy that are injected into
the blood vessels feeding the tumor(s).
The particles give off small amounts of
chemotherapy to the tumor over several
days.
Transarterial radioembolization
(TARE or RE) uses tiny glass or resin
beads filled with the radioactive isotope
yttrium-90 that are injected directly into the
tumor(s). This procedure is often referred
to as Y-90.

The type of arterially directed therapy
recommended will depend on the size,
number, and location of tumors as well as your

Your preferences about treatment
are always important. How much
time you want to spend in treatment
is also important. Talk to your care
team and make your wishes known.

Chemoembolization (also
known as TACE or transarterial
chemoembolization) involves
injecting a chemotherapy mixture into

Clinical trials

previous medical history and the expertise of
your treating physicians.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, protons,
electrons, and other sources to kill cancer cells
and shrink tumors. RT can be given alone
or with other treatments. It might be used as
supportive care or palliative care to help ease
pain or discomfort caused by cancer, or to
control bleeding caused by a tumor. RT may be
a treatment for all tumors, regardless of location.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Most types of radiation include short treatment
sessions that are given once daily over a few
days to weeks. Ask your care team which
radiation option(s) are best for you and what
side effects to expect.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.


EBRT
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside the body to aim radiation at
the tumor(s) or areas of the body.



Common types of EBRT that may be used to
treat your cancer include the following:






Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses
computer software and CT images to aim
beams that match the shape of the tumor.



Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape
of the tumor. This limits the amount of
radiation to normal tissue.



Stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) uses high-energy
radiation beams to kill or ablate the tumor.

Phase I trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase II trials study how well the drug
or approach works against a specific type
of cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or
approach against a standard treatment. If
the results are good, it may be approved
by the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Treating gallbladder and bile duct cancers » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside the clinical trial at any time.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
Rarely. It depends on the study, your health
insurance, and the state in which you live.
In general, procedures, drugs, or tests that
are considered standard of care will be billed
to you or your insurance, whereas those
considered research are covered by the trial
sponsor. Your treatment team and the research
team can help determine if you are responsible
for any costs.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Supportive care
Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to prevent,
reduce, and relieve suffering, and to improve
quality of life. Supportive care might include
pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual
support, financial aid, or family counseling. Tell
your care team how you are feeling and about
any side effects so they can be managed. Best
supportive care, supportive care, and palliative
care are often used interchangeably.

It is important to tell
your care team about
all side effects so they
can be managed.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.
Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment.

Late effects

Side effects

Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

Survivorship

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancers, 2023

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. When treatment
leads to remission (or no evidence of disease),
you will need follow-up or survivorship care for
late effects. During survivorship care you will
still have a care team, but it will look different.
Seek out peer support groups, whether online
or in-person.

can be placed, bile may need to be drained
through an opening in the side of the body.
You may need a new or second stent during
or after cancer treatment if the tumor grows. A
biliary bypass is a surgery to re-route the flow
of bile from the common bile duct into the small
intestine. The result is that the bile flow avoids
(bypasses) the blocked part of the duct.

Blocked bile duct
A tumor in the liver may grow large enough to
block your bile duct. A bile duct is a small tube
that drains digestive fluid (bile) from the liver.
The common bile duct carries bile from the liver
through the pancreas and into the first part of
the small intestine (duodenum). A blocked duct
causes bile to build up in the liver. As a result,
you may have pain, itching, discomfort, and/
or yellowing of the skin and eyes. This is called
jaundice. This blockage can cause an infection
of the bile duct called cholangitis.

When biliary drainage is an
option
Biliary drainage before surgery may help
improve your health and recovery after
surgery. Biliary drainage may be an option
even if you cannot have surgery. It may also
be recommended if you have metastatic
disease, to improve your liver function and
nutrition, and to reduce the risk of infection.

Difficulty eating

Biliary drainage requires careful planning. Your
treatment team should discuss and decide if
this is a safe procedure for you.

Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or its treatment might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating
is important during treatment. It includes eating
a balanced diet, eating the right amount of
food, and drinking enough fluids. A registered
dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food
can help. Speak to your care team if you have
trouble eating or maintaining weight.

If it is an option, you may have biliary drainage
using one of the following methods.






Surgical bypass involves attaching
the gallbladder or bile duct directly to the
small intestine to drain the fluid. However,
this way of draining fluid is rarely used. It
carries the same risks as major surgery.
Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
uses an endoscope to reach the bile
ducts and drain the fluid. Your doctor may
insert a plastic or metal stent so the fluid
drains directly into the small intestine.
This is usually an outpatient procedure
performed by a gastroenterologist that
does not require you to stay in the
hospital. A wallet-sized ID card may
be given to you at the time of the stent
placement. Biliary stents may block over
time and may need to be replaced.

Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicine that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Percutaneous transhepatic
cholangiography (PTC) places a
stent through the skin to drain the fluid.
This approach may be used when the
endoscope cannot reach the blocked
bile duct. This is usually an outpatient
procedure performed by an interventional
radiologist that does not require you to
stay in the hospital.

Pain
Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain.

team will choose a treatment plan
that is best for you.

Treatment will be based on if the cancer is
resectable or unresectable. Ask questions about
the tests and procedures you might have. You
might meet with a surgeon during this time.
Treatment will be based on if the tumor is
resectable or unresectable. More information
can be found on the following pages.

Overview
The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ
found under the liver. It is made up of several
layers of tissue. The inner and outer layers
are membranes. A membrane is a very thin
layer that covers a surface. In between
these membranes are layers of muscle and
connective tissue.

Found during surgery
Gallbladder cancer might be found by chance
during surgery for something other than
gallbladder cancer. This could be for treatment
for suspected gallstones or inflammation of the
gallbladder known as cholecystitis. A sample of
the tumor might be taken and tested for cancer.
Also, if any lymph nodes look like they might
have cancer, they will be biopsied and tested.

Gallbladder cancer starts in the innermost
layer and grows outward through the layers
of the gallbladder wall. Cancer can spread to
nearby veins, arteries, bile ducts, and organs
such as the liver.
Gallbladder cancer is often found by chance.
This is called an incidental finding. Treatment
is based on how the cancer was found, if the
cancer has spread, and if there is cancer in
any nearby organs and blood vessels. Tests
will determine if the tumor can be removed
with surgery.

see if your cancer is fast-growing. If this is the
case, then surgery would not be used.

Gallbladder cancer can be found during
pathology review following a cholecystectomy
for cholelithiasis (gallstones) or of a condition
that was originally felt to be non-cancerous.
An expert hepatobiliary pathologist should
review your pathology results. Your care team
will check the pathology report for details on
the tumor size and location, and if there were
signs of disease in the cystic duct, other ducts,
or nearby areas. The location of the tumor or
abnormal cells is very important in guiding
therapy, especially with surgery.

A clinical trial is also an option for cancer found
in the cystic duct lymph node.

T1b or larger
A T1b tumor has invaded the muscle layer of
the gallbladder wall. For a tumor that is T1b or
greater, surgery might be possible. This would
remove part of the liver (hepatic resection),
nearby lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy), and
possibly the bile duct.

T1a tumor

Found on imaging

A T1a tumor has grown through the innermost
layer (epithelium) into the lamina propria. If
the tumor is small with negative margins, then
observation will be considered. You might hear
this called watch-and-wait. During observation,
you might have imaging and blood tests to
monitor tumor growth.

Sometimes, a tumor or mass may be found on
an imaging test being done for other medical
reasons. If there is concern for gallbladder
cancer, more tests will be ordered. It can
be difficult to see exactly how much cancer
there is and where it might have spread using
imaging tests alone. As a result, a laparoscopy
can be helpful to stage your cancer. If you
have jaundice, biliary drainage might be done
to see if it can relieve any bile duct blockage.

Cystic duct node-positive
The cystic duct lymph node is found near
the cystic duct. Cancer found outside the
gallbladder and in the nearby cystic duct lymph
node is called cystic duct node-positive.
Treatment is often surgery. This would

Jaundice with cancer

Treatment

Bile is made by the liver. It contains bilirubin,
the yellow-brown substance that gives bile its
color. Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin and
whites of the eyes due to a buildup of bilirubin
in the body. Sometimes, a tumor can block
the flow of bile, leading to increased bilirubin
levels in the blood, as well as jaundice. You
may have itching and dark-colored urine. If the
common bile duct or the common hepatic duct
is blocked, your stool (poop) may turn white.

You might meet with a surgeon to learn about
treating your jaundice and cancer. You might
have a staging laparoscopy to find out the
extent of disease and why there is a blockage
causing the jaundice.
If you have a blocked bile duct or
jaundice, then biliary drainage will be
done before surgery or treatment with
systemic therapy. Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or
percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
(PTC) are used to treat jaundice.

Tests
If you have jaundice with gallbladder cancer,
you will have blood and imaging tests. Tests
include an x-ray of the bile ducts called
a cholangiography. Magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is the
preferred type of cholangiography.

Standard of care is the bestknown way to treat particular
disease based on past clinical
trials. There may be more than
one treatment regimen that is
considered standard of care. Ask
your care team what treatment
options are available and if a
clinical trial might be right for
you.

Gallbladder cancer » Resectable

Resectable
A resectable tumor can be removed with
surgery. You will have surgery to remove the
gallbladder (cholecystectomy), part of the liver
(en bloc hepatic resection), some lymph nodes
(lymphadenectomy), and possibly the bile duct.

Need help paying for
medicine or treatment?
Ask your care team
what options are

A gallbladder cancer operation requires a
skilled surgeon. Sometimes, a resectable tumor
cannot be removed during surgery. This might
be due to the tumor being wrapped around
major veins or arteries. If cancer has spread to
lymph nodes, bile ducts, or organs, it may not
be possible to remove all of the cancer.

Cholecystectomy
A cholecystectomy is the removal of the gallbladder. Surgery can be open or minimally

Surveillance

Treatment after surgery

After completing treatment for resectable
disease, you will enter surveillance.
Surveillance is a period of testing to watch
for signs that cancer has returned. It includes
tests for CA 19-9, CEA, as well as imaging
every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6
to 12 months for up to 5 years, or as needed.

Treatment after surgery is called adjuvant
therapy. It is not always possible to remove all
of the cancer during surgery. Adjuvant therapy
is given to kill any cancer cells that might have
been left behind. It also helps prevent the
return of cancer called recurrence.

treatment. Treatment options are based on the
size and location of the cancer.

When unresectable cancer progresses during

oncologists might try a different systemic
therapy.
For disease progression, the preferred option
is FOLFOX. FOLFOX is a combination
of chemotherapy drugs that includes

» Overview

Overview

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)
is a cancer of the bile duct.

A cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare cancer
that forms in the bile ducts.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma



(ICC) or intrahepatic bile duct
cancer is found in the bile ducts of
the liver. Together, you and your



care team will choose a treatment
plan that is best for you.

Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
(ECC) is found in bile ducts outside the
liver.

Bile is produced and secreted by cells
(hepatocytes) in the liver. It travels from the
liver to the gut through bile ducts. Epithelial
cells (cholangiocytes) line the bile ducts.
Abnormal growth of these cells can cause a
blockage in the bile duct. Cholangiocarcinomas
are tumors that start in the lining of the

Intrahepatic bile ducts

bile duct. Most cholangiocarcinomas are
adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas start in
cells that secrete fluids.

Imaging tests may include a CT of the chest, a
multiphasic CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and
a multiphasic MRI of the abdomen and pelvis.
Imaging of this area shows the size of the
cancer, if it spread to the liver, or if it invaded
the lymph nodes or blood vessels.

Inside the liver is a network of ducts, blood
vessels, and lymph vessels. Intrahepatic
bile ducts are a network of small tubes that
carry bile inside the liver. The smallest ducts
(ductules) join to form the right hepatic bile
duct and the left hepatic bile duct. The right
and left hepatic duct drain bile from the
liver. Cancer that starts inside these ducts
is intrahepatic bile duct cancer. It is not liver
cancer, which arises from liver cells called
hepatocytes.

Sometimes, intrahepatic bile duct cancers can
be confused with stomach, small intestine,
or colon tumors that spread to the liver. An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
colonoscopy may be done to check if cancer
has spread to the liver rather than occurring
in the bile ducts. You might be referred to a
hepatologist. A hepatologist specializes in the
care of the liver, biliary tract, gallbladder, and
pancreas.

There can be more than one tumor and it can
be found in the small ductules or in the larger
hepatic ducts. Treatment aims to prevent or
slow the spread of cancer.

Treatment
Treatment is based on if the tumor is:

Testing



Once it is confirmed that the isolated
tumor found on imaging is not liver cancer
(hepatocellular carcinoma), then you will
have imaging scans, blood tests, and scoping
procedures.





Blood tests will measure CEA, CA 19-9, AFP,
and liver function, and will check for a past or
current viral hepatitis infection. Hepatitis is a
risk factor for bile duct cancer. Some cancer
treatments can wake up (or reactivate) the
virus. If this happens, it can cause harm to the
liver.

If the cancer is unresectable or metastatic,
then MSI/MMR testing and other biomarker
testing will be done. For those with dMMR/
MSI-H tumors or a family history that suggests
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, then you might
have genetic testing and be referred to a

Treatment after surgery

A resectable tumor is one that can be removed
with surgery. Surgery to remove the tumor is
called liver resection (or partial hepatectomy).
During resection, some lymph nodes might
be removed in a lymphadenectomy. A
lymphadenectomy is done to check for cancer.
Also, your surgeon will look for cancer in
nearby veins, arteries, and tissues.

Treatment after surgery is called adjuvant
therapy. It is determined by the risk of the
tumor returning and/or if not all tumor could be
removed during surgery.




For intrahepatic bile duct cancers, resection
with cancer-free or negative margins (R0) is
the goal. Because this type of cancer occurs
in the bile ducts inside the liver, surgery may
include the removal of a section or piece of the
liver. The extent of surgery will depend on the
tumor size and location. If cancer has spread
beyond the nearby lymph nodes or to distant
sites, treatment other than surgery may be
offered.



In a clear or negative margin (R0), no
cancerous cells are found.
In an R1 positive margin, there is higher
risk that very small (microscopic) cancer
cells remain.
In an R2 positive margin, cancer that can
be seen without a microscope remains.

Adjuvant systemic therapies can be found in

A cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
is found in bile ducts inside the liver. It is
also called intrahepatic bile duct cancer.

While it’s true that
cholangiocarcinoma can be a
cunning and devastating cancer,
there are many of us living with
cholangiocarcinoma like it’s a
chronic disease, playing ‘whacka-mole’ with anything that
pops up. Use this diagnosis as a
catalyst to start cure-ating your
life every day! Stay in the Here
and Now, but also keep dreaming
about and planning for your
future.”

Treatment is based on if the cancer can
be removed with surgery (resectable),
cannot be removed with surgery
(unresectable), has spread to other parts
of the body (metastatic), and the risk of
recurrence.
Treatment before surgery is called
neoadjuvant. Treatment after surgery is
called adjuvant.
ICC can spread to blood vessels inside
the liver. From here it can spread
throughout the liver and structures
outside the liver such as the lining that
surrounds the abdominal organs (visceral
peritoneum).
If your tumor has a high number of
mutations (TMB-H) or specific gene
mutation such as NTRK, MSI-H/dMMR,
FGFR2, IDH1, or BRAF V600E, then you
might receive drug therapy that targets

Distal tumors

Before surgery you might have biliary
drainage. Extrahepatic cancers can spread to
the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and various
arteries and veins. Therefore, you might have
a staging laparoscopy or exploratory surgery to
gain knowledge about the amount and location
of your cancer.

Distal tumors are in the common bile duct that
passes through the pancreas. If the tumor
has invaded the pancreas, then a Whipple
procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) might
be needed. A Whipple procedure is surgery
that removes the head of the pancreas, the
gallbladder, duodenum (first part of the small
intestine), part of the bile duct, and often part
of the stomach.

Your treatment team of experts will discuss if
surgery is safe for you and whether the cancer
can be removed. This is called multidisciplinary
review.

Hilar or perihilar tumors
(Klatskin tumors)

You may have biliary drainage to drain fluid
from the biliary tract before surgery. During
surgery, the bile duct and nearby lymph nodes
are removed.

Hilar tumors are in the upper part of the
common bile duct that is closest to the liver.
Surgery to remove part of the liver (hepatic
resection) is likely for tumors in the hilar area.

A liver transplant is only for hilar tumors, but
not everyone is eligible for this treatment. It
requires an early visit to a specialized center.
You will have treatment and operative staging
before the actual transplant.

If you have jaundice, biliary drainage might
be done before starting systemic therapy. The
preferred systemic therapy is durvalumab
with gemcitabine and cisplatin. There are
many recommended options. For all systemic
therapy options, see Guide 13.

In a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed
and replaced with a healthy, donor liver. The
new liver may be donated from a person who
recently died, or a section of liver may be
donated from a living person. A liver transplant
is based on certain size limits and tumor
locations.

Metastatic
Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread
to other parts of the body. Fluid may block
the bile ducts, causing jaundice. If you have
jaundice, blocked bile duct will be treated
and drained. A biopsy may be done of the
metastasis to confirm that the cancer is bile
duct cancer (and not another type of cancer).

It is possible for someone to donate a portion
of the liver. Structures such as the inferior
vena cava, portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile
duct are reconnected to the new liver. Other
treatments may be given if you are waiting
for a transplant. These treatments are called
bridge or bridging therapy.

Options include systemic therapy, clinical trial,
and best supportive care. Best supportive care
is always given. You may consider joining a
clinical trial. For systemic therapy options,

Disease progression
If unresectable or metastatic extrahepatic
bile duct cancer progresses during or after
systemic therapy, then FOLFOX is the
preferred option. FOLFOX is a combination
of chemotherapy drugs that includes
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and

Chemoradiation (EBRT with
fluoropyrimidine)

oxaliplatin. If your tumor has a high number of
mutations (TMB-H) or a specific gene mutation
such as NTRK, MSI-H/dMMR, FGFR2, IDH1,
or BRAF V600E, then you might receive drug
therapy that targets the mutation. A clinical
trial is always an option. For next-line systemic
therapy options, see Guide 14.

Keep a pain diary

Not all bile duct cancers are the same.

A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

Extrahepatic bile ducts are small tubes
that carry bile outside the liver. They
include the common hepatic duct and the
common bile duct.
A cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare
cancer that forms in the bile ducts.
Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC)
is found in bile ducts outside the liver. It is
also called extrahepatic bile duct cancer.

Include in your pain diary:

3 The time and dose of all medicines
3 When pain starts and ends or lessens
3 Where you feel pain
3 A description of your pain. Is it

There are 2 types of extrahepatic bile duct
cancers: perihilar and distal types.
Treatment is based on if the cancer can
be removed with surgery (resectable),
cannot be removed with surgery
(unresectable), has spread to other parts
of the body (metastatic), and the risk of
recurrence.

throbbing, sharp, tingling, shooting, or
burning? Is it constant, or does it come
and go?

Treatment before surgery is called
neoadjuvant. Treatment after surgery is
called adjuvant.

3 Does the pain change at different times
of day? When?

3 Does the pain get worse before or

If your tumor has a high number of
mutations (TMB-H) or a specific gene
mutation such as NTRK, MSI-H/dMMR,
FGFR2, IDH1, or BRAF V600E, then you
might receive drug therapy that targets
the mutation.

make it better?

3 Does the pain get better or worse with
activity? What kind of activity?

3 Does the pain keep you from falling

Best supportive care may offer symptom
relief.

asleep at night? Does pain wake you
up in the night?

3 A rating of your pain from 0 (no pain) to
10 (worst pain you have ever felt)

3 Does pain get in the way of you doing
the things you enjoy?
