About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Central Nervous System Cancers, Version 1.2023 —
March 24, 2023.

challenging to treat, but treatment is

What is a glioma?
A glioma is a type of tumor that grows in the
brain. A tumor is an abnormal growth of cells.
Gliomas develop from certain brain cells called
glial cells. Glial cells support the function of
nerve cells (neurons) in the central nervous
system (the brain and the spinal cord). Many
types of tumors can occur in the central
nervous system. Only those that start as glial
cells become gliomas.

What causes a glioma?
No one knows exactly what causes most brain
tumors, including gliomas.
What experts do know is that brain tumors
often start with an abnormality (mutation)
in certain cells. This abnormality causes
these cells to grow out of control (become
cancerous). This type of mutation happens
on its own. It’s not typically passed down in
families (hereditary mutation).

Gliomas are the most common type of
malignant (cancerous) brain tumor in adults.
Gliomas can happen at any age but occur
more often in adults than in children. Gliomas
start in the brain or sometimes the spinal cord.
But they rarely spread to another area of the
body.
What makes gliomas so complicated is that
they invade and blend into the normal parts of
the brain. So gliomas can be very difficult to
treat without harming the healthy parts of the
brain.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

Gliomas occur in both children
and adults. This book discusses
gliomas only in adults.

1 About glioma » Are there types of gliomas?

Are there types of gliomas?

Besides tumor type, gliomas are also
categorized by grade. The grade indicates how
fast the tumor is likely to grow. A low-grade
glioma usually grows slowly while a high-grade
glioma often grows rapidly.

There are several types of glioma tumors.
The 3 most common types are astrocytomas,
oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastomas.
They’re made of different kinds of glial cells.






Although it helps to put gliomas into
categories, it’s important to note that each
glioma has its own molecular characteristics
and behavior. That also means that each
person’s glioma is unique. So your progress
and experience will be unique to you.

Astrocytomas look like star-shaped
glial cells called astrocytes. The main job
of astrocytes is to maintain the chemical
environment that allows communication
between nerve cells.
Oligodendrogliomas look like
oligodendrocytes, which are glial cells that
protect electrical signaling in nerve cells.
Glioblastomas come from precursor
cells that develop into cells like astrocytes
and oligodendrocytes. Glioblastomas are
the most destructive and dangerous type
of glioma tumor.

Gliomas often occur in the upper part of the
brain where they can disrupt important brain
functions.
Few gliomas in adults have distinct and welldefined edges like the one in this illustration.
Most gliomas blend deeply into normal
brain tissue and have vague borders. This
makes them very difficult to remove entirely.
When the tumor is removed, some tumor
cells must be left behind to avoid damaging
nearby brain tissue.

How are gliomas
diagnosed?

Diagnosis vs. prognosis

A glioma is often found when it starts causing
symptoms. A symptom is a problem or feeling
that may be a sign of disease. Gliomas cause
symptoms when they put pressure on the brain
or invade brain tissue. Some people have
many symptoms while others don’t have any.
Common symptoms of gliomas include:


Unusual or frequent headaches



Seizures



Changes in personality or mood



Nausea and vomiting



Difficulty speaking or swallowing



Muscle weakness



What’s the difference between
your diagnosis and your
prognosis? These two words
sound alike but they’re very
different.

Diagnosis: The identification of an
illness based on tests. The diagnosis
names what illness you have.
Prognosis: The likely course and
outcome of a disease. The prognosis
predicts how your disease will turn out.

Difficulty with walking, balance, or
coordination

Symptoms provide clues that something
is wrong. But they don’t provide enough
information to identify a specific illness.
Different tests, physical exams, and surgical
procedures are required to diagnose a glioma.
If these tests show that you have a glioma,
your care team will discuss your treatment
options with you. If possible, seek care at a
center with experience in treating brain tumors.

Can gliomas be cured?

It’s true that gliomas are eventually fatal for
most patients. Many people diagnosed with a
glioma have a difficult road ahead. Still, there’s
hope. New therapies designed to treat specific
types of gliomas are currently being studied in
clinical trials. The number of these trials has
increased in recent years, offering more hope
to people living with this disease.

Most gliomas are not curable, but they are
usually treatable. Treatment can slow down
the tumor’s growth for a period of time, reduce
its symptoms, and prolong life. The main
treatments for a glioma are surgery, radiation
therapy, and chemotherapy. These are often
combined with one another for more complete
treatment.

Also, be aware that survival statistics come
from research done several (or many) years
ago. Those statistics may not reflect the
improvements offered by today’s diagnostic
tests and treatments.

Another option to consider is participating in a
clinical trial for a potential new treatment.
Treatment may be able to stop the glioma
from growing and keep it stabilized for a time.
This may last for months or years. However,
even with the best treatment, gliomas usually
grow back eventually. So periodic follow-up
visits and additional rounds of treatment are
recommended.

What’s next?
This chapter provided a brief introduction on
gliomas. The next chapter explains the tests
needed to diagnose and monitor this disease.

A message
to caregivers and loved ones
This book is for you, too. This book will help you understand this disease and the challenges
it presents. People with tumors in the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)
commonly develop problems with brain function. This can show itself in multiple ways, such
as slower thinking, memory loss, difficulty moving or walking, trouble speaking, inability to do
everyday activities, changes in behavior, losing one’s sense of self, and other problems.
Helping a person with a brain tumor can be challenging and time-consuming. You may be
providing physical, mental, emotional, and hands-on support. You may be taking the patient
to appointments, helping to lessen side effects, and even assisting with treatment decisions.
Gather as much help as you can. Start with the online resources listed in the back of this
book.

Some people with low-grade gliomas never
have symptoms. Low-grade gliomas generally
grow slowly and can develop for years before
they’re diagnosed. High-grade gliomas can
cause a range of symptoms. These gliomas
can grow quickly, developing in months or
weeks. However, symptoms can also be
caused by medical problems other than
tumors. So for the most accurate diagnosis, be
sure to tell your provider and care team about
any and all symptoms you’re having, even if
the symptoms seem unrelated.

most appropriate for you.

You’ll need a variety of tests to diagnose a
brain tumor and to make a treatment plan.
(If you’ve already had testing and received a
glioma diagnosis, you can turn to Chapter 3 to
read about your treatment options.)
Testing begins with an examination of your
general health and an evaluation of your
symptoms. Bring someone with you to listen,
ask questions, and write down the answers.

Common symptoms include:


Health and symptoms
Your care team needs to have all of your
health information. They’ll ask you about any
health problems and treatments you’ve had.
Be prepared to talk about any illness or injury
you’ve had and when it happened. Tell your

Symptoms
Each part of the brain has its own job to do.
Different parts of the brain manage different
parts of the body. Symptoms occur when an
area of the brain doesn’t work properly.
Symptoms are often related to the location of
the tumor in the brain as well as the size of
the tumor. Symptoms develop as the glioma
grows against, or weaves itself into, a part

Headaches – Headaches are very
common and often the first symptom in
people with a glioma. Headaches can
be worse in the morning, wake you up in
the middle of the night, and occur with
nausea and vomiting.
Seizures – Seizures are also frequent
in people with brain tumors. Seizures are
often an early sign of a glioma, especially
in low-grade gliomas.
Fatigue – Fatigue is another common
symptom of a glioma. Fatigue can
be debilitating, frequent, emotionally
overwhelming, and not related to how
much sleep you get or how much activity
you do. However, physical activity or
exercise can sometimes help.
Nausea and vomiting – Nausea and
vomiting can be caused by the tumor
putting increased pressure on the brain.

2 Glioma testing » Health and symptoms

Other symptoms also sometimes occur.
Gliomas can cause vision problems such
as blurred vision, double vision, or loss of
peripheral (side) vision. Sensory disturbances
include numbness, tingling, or burning
sensations often on one side of the body. And
high-grade gliomas are linked to blood clots in
the legs and the lungs, which can cause leg
swelling, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

Problems with thinking and speech
– Examples include confusion, memory
loss, and speech difficulties.
Weakness or problems moving
– People with a brain tumor may have
muscle weakness on one side of the
body, or difficulty with walking or balance.
Changes in personality or mood
– Changes in behavior, mood, and
personality can occur in people whose
tumors are located in parts of the brain
that control mood and personality.

If you have any of these symptoms, your
provider may want to take a closer look. This
is where imaging comes in, which is discussed
on the next page.

Neurological exam
A neurological exam involves some simple
tests to check your alertness, thinking,
balance, coordination, reflexes, strength,
hearing, and senses of touch and smell. You
may also have an eye exam to check the
health of the nerves in the back of your eyes.

Fatigue is more than just being
tired. It can be physical, cognitive,
or emotional. It can be created
from external sources, such as
noise, or internal sources, such as
medication, not eating properly, or
not getting enough exercise.”

Performance status
Your team will want to know how well you can
do ordinary day-to-day activities—like working,
taking a walk, climbing stairs, cooking dinner,
carrying laundry, or taking a bath or shower.
This evaluation is called performance status.
The more activities you can do, the better
your performance status. Your care team uses
this evaluation to get a sense of the level of
treatment you may be able to handle and
whether you may be eligible for a clinical trial.

MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to
take pictures of the inside of the body. During
an MRI, you’ll lie on a table that slides into the
scanning machine. (An open MRI scanner may
be an option at some health care centers.)
It’s important to lie still during the test to get
the best pictures. You may be given a padded
head brace or other devices to help you stay
motionless. The machine makes loud noises
but you can wear earplugs and listen to music.

Imaging

You’ll have multiple MRI tests throughout
diagnosis and treatment. MRI is also used
after treatment to see how well the treatment
worked. You’ll have more MRIs during followup to watch for any recurrence or new growth.

If you have signs or symptoms of a brain
tumor, your care team will want to try to find it
and see what it looks like. Imaging tests are
used to make pictures (images) of the insides
of your body. The images can reveal a tumor’s
location, size, and other features.

CT

MRI

If MRI is unavailable or not recommended for
you, you might have a computed tomography
(CT or CAT) scan instead. A CT scan uses
x-rays to take many images of your body from
different angles. A computer then combines the
pictures to make a 3D image.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most
useful imaging test for identifying a glioma.
MRI scans are good at showing the soft
tissues, including the brain, as well as other
details that help plan surgery.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

2 Glioma testing » Biopsy

Stereotactic biopsy

After imaging
After the MRI or CT scan, your images will be
studied by a radiologist, an expert in analyzing
images of the nervous system. The radiologist
will convey the imaging results to your care
team. This information helps your team plan
what the next steps of your care should be.

This is a very precise procedure that’s often
used when a brain tumor is in a hard-to-reach
or vital area. It aims to remove only enough of
the tumor to make a diagnosis.
A stereotactic biopsy is done by a
neurosurgeon in an operating room. First,
you’ll be fitted with a frame or several tiny
markers around your head to aid the surgery.
Next, you’ll be given anesthesia to go to sleep.
A small area of your hair will be trimmed down
to the scalp.

If your images seem to show a glioma, the
next step may be a biopsy.

Biopsy

The neurosurgeon will then make a little
opening in your skull and insert a thin, hollow
needle into the brain to remove a sliver of the
tumor. A computerized navigation system,
connected to MRI or CT imaging, will allow
the surgeon to target and remove the sample
with a high degree of precision. After removal,
the opening in your scalp will be closed with
sutures. You may be able to go home the next
day.

If imaging scans show something that may be
a glioma, your care providers will usually want
to take a sample and evaluate it. A surgical
procedure that removes a small piece of tissue
for testing is called a biopsy. Getting a biopsy
of a tumor is the only way to get an accurate
diagnosis of your condition. A biopsy also gives
your care team clues on how to treat your
tumor.
A surgical procedure called a resection does
double duty as both a biopsy and a treatment.
In a resection, your neurosurgeon will attempt
to remove the entire tumor or as much of the
tumor as safely possible. Removing the tumor
could relieve symptoms and help you live
longer. Also, a large sample of the tumor can
give the most complete pathology results.

Open biopsy
Like a resection, an open biopsy is a surgical
procedure that involves making a small
opening in the skull (craniotomy).
First, you’ll be given anesthesia that will
let you sleep through the procedure. Your
neurosurgeon will cut open a section of your
scalp and then remove a piece of skull bone.
Using small surgical knives and other special
instruments, the neurosurgeon will carefully
remove a piece or pieces of the tumor. The
segment of skull bone will be replaced and the
incision will be sewn up.

Sometimes a resection isn’t possible. This
happens when the glioma is in a difficult place
to reach or is located in a vital part of the brain.
In these cases, your provider will schedule a
standard biopsy.
There are 2 types of standard biopsies for
gliomas: stereotactic biopsy and open biopsy.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

2 Glioma testing » Lab testing

Lab testing

diagnosis during your surgery helps the
neurosurgeon to decide how much of the
tumor to remove.

After either type of biopsy, the tissue sample
will be sent to a laboratory for analysis.
A specialist called a neuropathologist will
examine the tissue under a microscope.

The neuropathologist will also do molecular
(genetic) testing, which indicates the type and
growth rate of your glioma and other specific
features. All this information will help your
treatment team figure out the best treatment
plan for you.

Sometimes, the sample is taken straight to
the neuropathologist while you’re still in the
operating room. The neuropathologist will
perform an analysis right away and send the
results back to the neurosurgeon.

If your hospital or medical center doesn’t have
a neuropathologist, you can ask to have your
biopsy sent to one.

The results will say whether the tumor
is malignant (cancerous) or benign (not
cancerous). The results may also include the
preliminary diagnosis, including the type and
grade of the glioma. Knowing the preliminary

2 Glioma testing » Your tumor type

Your tumor type

When these 3 classifications are put together,
it provides a full description of the glioma.
For example, an “astrocytoma IDH-mutant
grade 2” names its cell type (astrocytoma), its
biomarker (IDH-mutant), and its growth rate
(grade 2).

If molecular testing was performed on your
biopsy sample, the pathology report should
reveal your tumor type. It’s important to identify
the exact type of tumor you have to predict
the course of your disease and plan your
treatment.

Let’s look at each of these classifications in
turn.

There are 3 ways to classify a glioma:






Histology

Histology – The first way to classify
the tumor is by looking at it under a
microscope. This is called histology. For
instance, a glioma with cells that look like
astrocytes is likely to be an astrocytoma.

Histology means evaluating the structure
of cells or tissues under a microscope. A
neuropathologist does a histologic analysis
when inspecting tissue from a biopsy. The
neuropathologist will examine the tumor cells
to classify the disease. The neuropathologist’s
report will state if the tumor started in the
central nervous system or elsewhere. If the
tumor is a glioma, the cell type will be noted in
the report.

Grade – Another way to classify a
tumor is by grade, which is a rating of
how abnormal its cells are. The more
abnormal its cells, the faster and farther
the tumor is likely to grow.
Biomarkers – A glioma is also identified
by its biomarkers. A biomarker is a
molecular characteristic such as a genetic
mutation. Each type of glioma has its
own biomarker or set of biomarkers. For
example, an astrocytoma may have a
mutation in the IDH gene. So it would be
called an astrocytoma IDH-mutant.

The types of gliomas are named after the glial
cells that they resemble. The neuropathologist
can see this under the microscope. For
example, an astrocytoma looks like cells called
astrocytes. And an oligodendroglioma looks
like oligodendrocytes.

“

Brain tumors are insidious because the symptom burden can feel
like an attack on the very nature of the self, including personality
changes, language and memory impairment, physical
impairment, and poor prognosis.”

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

16

2 Glioma testing » Your tumor type

Grade

Biomarkers

Another way that gliomas are classified is by
grade. The grade indicates how quickly the
glioma is likely to grow and spread. Tumors
are graded from 1 to 4 based mostly on how
much the tumor cells look like normal cells.
Low-grade gliomas include grades 1 and 2.
High-grade gliomas include grades 3 and
4. Grades are used to predict the outlook
(prognosis) of the tumor and to plan treatment.

The neuropathologist also tests the tissue
sample for specific biomarkers. Biomarker
tests provide more details about the glioma
tumor. A biomarker is something found in the
body that’s a sign of a condition, disease, or
abnormality.









In cancer care, biomarker testing looks
for changes in genes, proteins, and other
markers. Many of these changes are
mutations. A mutation is an abnormal
change in your DNA—your body’s genetic
instructions. A mutation can disrupt how some
cells behave, which can cause diseases like
cancer.

Grade 1 tumors grow slowly and are
usually benign. Many people with grade
1 gliomas can be treated with surgery
alone. But if the tumor grows back,
additional therapy may be given. Grade
1 gliomas are more common in children
than in adults.

Biomarker testing can improve the accuracy
of your diagnosis as well as fine-tune your
treatment options. If testing detects a certain
mutation, you might be able to receive
treatment that’s targeted more precisely to
your glioma. Right now, only a few targeted
treatments are available for very specific kinds
of glioma. But researchers are working on
hundreds of clinical trials to find more.

Grade 2 tumor cells look somewhat
abnormal. These tumors grow slowly and
can invade normal tissue. They may not
grow back for many years. But when they
do, they usually come back as a highergrade glioma.
Grade 3 tumor cells don’t look much
like normal cells. They quickly increase
in number and invade nearby tissue.
All high-grade tumors (grades 3 and 4)
require additional therapy—like radiation
and chemotherapy—after surgery.

The following biomarkers aren’t the only
biomarkers of gliomas, but they’re the most
commonly tested. Finding these biomarkers
(or not finding them) can provide specific
information about your glioma. See Guide 1
on the next page.

Grade 4 tumor cells look very abnormal.
These tumors grow and spread very
quickly. Glioblastomas are the most
common grade 4 gliomas.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

Ask what biomarker testing is available for
your glioma. Some hospitals and treatment
centers aren’t able to provide a full range of
biomarker tests. But you can request your
tissue to be sent to another lab for further
testing.

The most common imaging test for
glioma is an MRI, or magnetic resonance
imaging.
A neuropathologist will inspect a tissue
sample from your biopsy under a
microscope. This can confirm whether
you have a glioma and what type it may
be.
Low-grade tumors grow very slowly
and may not come back for years after
surgery. High-grade tumor cells look very
different from normal cells and typically
grow very quickly.
Biomarker testing analyzes your glioma
for abnormal changes in genes, proteins,
and other markers. Biomarker testing is
needed for a final diagnosis as well as for
fine-tuning your treatment plan.

Treatment options vary depending
on the cell type, grade, size, and

The first aim of surgery is to safely take out
as much of the tumor as possible (resection).

the better your prognosis. Surgery may also

location of the tumor. Your care
team will explain the benefits and
risks of all your available options.

There are many ways to try to treat a glioma,
but none are perfect. The most common
treatment options include surgery, radiation
therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of
these.

Another aim of surgery is to confirm the
diagnosis. During tumor surgery, tissue is
removed from the tumor and tested to confirm
whether it’s a glioma and what type it is.
A neurosurgeon (an expert in surgery of the
nervous system) will perform your surgery.
Deciding which procedure to perform is a
complex and difficult decision. Should it be
a resection, a partial resection, or a biopsy?
Is surgery even possible? Not all people with
gliomas will be able to have surgery.

The first treatment is usually surgery to remove
as much of the tumor as possible or to biopsy
the tumor.
Next, you may have radiation therapy and
chemotherapy to destroy the tumor cells left
behind. For example, surgery may take away
the majority of the tumor. Then radiation
therapy can attack what’s left of the tumor
cells. See Guide 2.

What is awake surgery?
You may need to be awake during part of
the operation if your tumor is located near
parts of the brain that control senses,
movement, or speech. The neurosurgeon
will stimulate these functional areas while
asking you questions.

How close the tumor is to “eloquent”
areas of the brain

You’ll be conscious but given local
anesthesia and a light sedative so that
you won’t feel pain.

Whether the surgery might relieve
pressure on the brain
Whether the tumor can be easily and
safely removed

To locate areas for movement, the
surgeon may ask you to wiggle your
toes or your fingers. To identify language
areas, you may be asked to count out
loud or perform other speech tests. This
lets the surgeon know what tissue can be
taken out and what needs to stay. After
the tumor tissue is removed, you’ll be
sedated for the rest of the operation.

The time since your last surgery (for
people with a recurrent glioma)

Eloquent areas of the brain are those that
control important functions like speech, vision,
hearing, and movement. Damage to an
eloquent area can impair the related function in
the body. This is why surgeons must be careful
about how much tissue they remove.

Resection
The surgeon will use a small drill to remove a
piece of your skull (craniotomy). A cut into your
brain may be needed to reach the tumor.

Resection is a major surgery that removes
a large piece of tissue. In a full resection
(also called a gross total resection), the
neurosurgeon removes all of the tumor
that can be detected with imaging. A partial
resection removes part of the tumor. A full
resection offers a better chance of fewer
symptoms and longer life.

This is a delicate and precise operation.
Surgeons often use computers programmed
with MRI or CT scans of your tumor to guide
the surgery. This technology serves as a GPS
for your brain. It helps the surgeon to precisely
locate and carefully remove as much tumor as
possible without removing nearby brain tissue.

You may need to be awake during part of the
operation so that the key brain areas can be
found. You’ll still be given some anesthesia to
help you relax during an awake surgery.

After the tumor is removed, the small piece of
your skull will be replaced, and you’ll be given

time to recover. You’ll have another MRI or CT
the day after the surgery to confirm how much
of the tumor was removed.

Go to a hospital that specializes in
brain tumors.”

For most gliomas, there are microscopic tumor
cells that can’t be seen, even with imaging
systems like MRI, in the tissue outside of the
tumor. So some tumor cells are almost always
left behind after the tumor is removed.

tumor area to damage the DNA inside the
tumor cells. This either kills the tumor cells or
stops new tumor cells from being made. You
won’t see, hear, or feel the radiation. It passes
through your skin and other tissues to reach
the tumor.

Radiation therapy
You may be given radiation therapy after you
recover from surgery to try to destroy any
glioma cells that remain. Radiation therapy is
used to treat both fully resected and partially
resected tumors. A radiation oncologist—an
expert in using radiation to treat cancer—will
manage your radiation treatment.

Depending on the type of glioma, radiation
may be delivered to the tumor plus some
tissue around it that contains both tumor cells
and normal cells. Because radiation can harm
normal cells, your radiation oncologist will use
methods that avoid and lessen the radiation
applied to normal brain tissues. Your radiation
plan will be tailored to you, your tumor, and
your brain.

Radiation therapy focuses high-energy rays
on tumor cells. The rays are delivered to the

therapy, you may be
fitted with a mesh mask

include a decrease in mental functioning. Your
multidisciplinary team will work with you to help
with these problems.

During treatment, you’ll lie on the treatment
table and be told how to get into the position
needed for treatment. You must remain
completely motionless during radiation
treatment. You’ll be fitted with a special head
mask to help you hold still. Other devices may
also be used to help you to stay still during
radiation therapy.

These aren’t the only side effects of radiation.
Ask your treatment team for a complete list of
common and rare side effects. If a side effect
bothers you, tell your treatment team. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects.

The total dose of radiation is spread out
over a number of treatments (fractions). The
number of treatments varies among patients.
Treatments are usually given once a day, up to
5 days a week, for 2 to 6 weeks. One session
takes about 15 to 30 minutes. This includes
only a few minutes of actual radiation time.
Your radiation oncologist will see you every
week to review how you’re doing.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses drugs to damage and
destroy rapidly dividing cells throughout the
body. Because tumor cells divide and multiply
rapidly, they’re a good target for chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy can harm healthy cells, too.
That’s why chemotherapy can cause side
effects.

Side effects of radiation
Your radiation oncologist will discuss the
possible side effects of radiation. Side effects
from radiation therapy differ among people.
Factors like tumor type, tumor location,
radiation dose, length of treatment, and
other factors all play a role. Side effects are
cumulative, meaning they intensify over the
course of treatment.

Receiving chemotherapy
A single chemotherapy drug or a combination
of drugs can be used for treatment.
Temozolomide (Temodar) is a standard single
chemotherapy drug for glioma. A combination
of drugs is sometimes chosen because these
drugs work better when they’re used together.
A common drug combination for glioma
treatment is procarbazine, lomustine, and
vincristine (or PCV).

The most common side effect of radiation is
tiredness despite sleep (fatigue). You may also
have hair loss or irritation on your scalp where
treatment was applied. Other side effects of
radiation include swelling (which may feel like
pressure inside your head), headache, and
sometimes nausea or loss of appetite. Rare
side effects include seizures, hearing loss,
speech or memory problems, and worsening
of symptoms you already had before treatment
started. Possible long-term side effects
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

Your neuro-oncologist or medical oncologist
will discuss your chemotherapy options with
you.
Chemotherapy is given in cycles. One cycle
involves a few treatment days followed by
several days for recovery. The cycles vary
in length depending on which drugs are
24

3 Overview of glioma treatments » Chemotherapy

used. Common cycles are 14, 21, or 28
days long. Having chemotherapy in cycles
gives your body a chance to recover after
receiving the treatment. If you’re going to have
chemotherapy, ask your medical oncologist
how many cycles and days of treatment there
will be within a cycle.

Some side effects can be very serious. Others
are not serious but are still unpleasant. Most
side effects appear while you're undergoing
treatment and then stop after treatment is over.
Other side effects are long-term or may even
appear years later.
Common side effects of chemotherapy include
low blood cell counts, not feeling hungry,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, fatigue,
and mouth sores. Ask your neuro-oncologist
or medical oncologist which drugs cause
which side effects. Medication is available
to manage or prevent some side effects. To
learn about preventing and managing nausea
and vomiting, read the NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Nausea and Vomiting available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Some chemotherapy drugs are given through
an intravenous (IV) infusion into a vein in
your arm or another part of your body. Other
chemotherapy drugs (like temozolomide) can
be taken as a pill.
One chemotherapy drug, carmustine (Gliadel),
is given as a “wafer” implant and must be
placed inside the brain at the time of surgery.
Each wafer is about the size of a dime. Up to
8 wafers may be used. They’re placed into
the brain during total resection, in the space
where the tumor had been. The wafers treat
the leftover tumor cells in the surrounding
tissue. The wafers dissolve over time, letting
out chemotherapy little by little. Be aware that
receiving this treatment may disqualify you
from joining a clinical trial.
Chemotherapy is usually given in combination
with radiation therapy. The timing of
chemotherapy is based on the tumor’s
grade and rate of growth, your health and
performance status, the success of surgical
tumor removal, and other factors.

Not all side effects of chemotherapy are
listed here. Ask your team for a complete list
of common and rare side effects, and what
treatments are available.

Side effects of chemotherapy
The side effects of chemotherapy depend
on many things. These include the drug, the
amount taken, the length of treatment, and the
person. Some people have many side effects.
Others have few.

electrodes attached to several patches that
safely adhere to your scalp. Because the
patches need to be placed on skin, your hair
will be shaved. The electrodes are linked to
an energy-producing device and a battery you
carry with you. You wear it at home and when
going out. You can wear a wig, a scarf, or a hat
over it if you want.

Alternating electric field therapy is a treatment
that uses low-intensity energy to stop tumor
cells from multiplying. It’s also called tumor
treating fields (TTFields). This treatment is an
option for certain people with newly diagnosed
or recurrent glioblastomas.

The treatment is intended to be used for at
least 18 hours a day for at least 4 weeks. The
most common side effect is skin irritation.

Here’s the idea behind this therapy: Tumor
cells multiply by dividing into more tumor
cells. Electromagnetic TTFields disrupt this
replication process. The energy is “tuned”
specifically to glioblastoma cells to interfere
with their cell division. TTFields destroy newly
dividing tumor cells but don’t affect healthy
cells.
The TTFields device (called Optune Gio)
looks something like a swim cap connected
with wires to a carry-along battery pack. The
electric field energy is distributed through

Targeted therapy

Clinical trials

Targeted therapy drugs attack certain parts of
tumor cells to slow their growth and spread.
Because targeted therapy is aimed only
at tumor cells not healthy cells, it doesn’t
have the same side effects as standard
chemotherapy.

NCCN experts recommend that everyone with
a glioma consider joining a clinical trial for
treatment.
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. Clinical trials are a key way to assess
new treatment approaches. After being
developed and tested in a laboratory, potential
new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied
in people. If found to be safe and effective
in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment
approach may be approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).

At this time, only a few targeted therapy
drugs are available for gliomas. Also, they’re
only effective against gliomas that multiply or
spread through the specific enzyme, protein, or
other molecule that they target. For example, a
BRAF inhibitor only works against tumor cells
that have a mutation in the BRAF gene.

Talk to your treatment team about whether a
clinical trial makes sense for you. Everyone
with cancer should carefully consider all the
treatment options available for their type of
cancer, including standard treatments and
clinical trials.

Observation
The recommended treatment for most gliomas
is surgical removal (resection). However,
observation may be a better or safer option
for some people. Observation means your
treatment team will check on your condition
using regular tests over a period of time. No
treatment is given unless symptoms appear or
your condition changes.

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in certain ways and
that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

Supportive care
Supportive care (also called palliative care)
is health care for the symptoms of cancer
and the side effects of cancer treatment.
Supportive care is appropriate for anyone,
regardless of age, cancer stage, or the need
for other therapies.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. This is
an agreement that confirms you’ve been fully

carefully and ask questions before signing it.
Take time to discuss it with family, friends, or
other people you trust. Keep in mind that you
can leave and seek treatment outside of the

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It’s common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You’ll be informed if a
placebo is part of a clinical trial before you
enroll.

Are clinical trials free?
There’s no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or childcare due
to extra appointments and the costs of routine
patient care during the trial. Depending on the

trial, you may continue to receive standard
cancer care. The standard therapy is billed
to—and often covered by—insurance. You’re
responsible for copays and any costs for this
care that aren’t covered by your insurance.

3 Overview of glioma treatments » What’s next?

“

What’s next?
Now that you’ve been introduced to the
various treatment options, the first step toward
treatment is to come up with the best possible
treatment plan. This plan involves many
different health care providers.

Ask about clinical trials available
to you and the services your
hospital and other facilities
provide to cancer patients, such
as counseling, nutritional advice,
meditation, physical therapy,
palliative care, and integrative
medicine. Don’t be shy. Be your
own advocate—or ask someone
close to be one for you.”

Multidisciplinary care
During the course of your diagnosis and
treatment, you’ll be cared for by numerous
doctors, specialists, and allied health
providers.
These may include a neuro-oncologist,
neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, medical
oncologist, neuropathologist, radiologist,
ophthalmologist, nurses, primary care doctor,
nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
palliative care specialist, pain specialist,
psychologist, social workers, nutritionist,
and rehabilitation specialists like physical,
occupational, and speech therapists.

Ask who will coordinate your care and what
efforts can be made to schedule appointments
together.
The next chapter explains what your specific
treatment may be if you have a low-grade
glioma. The chapter after that discusses
treatment details if you have a high-grade
glioma.

When all these providers are working and
communicating as a team to help you, it’s
called multidisciplinary care.
Your multidisciplinary care team should clearly
discuss your care goals with you. Removing
or reducing the size of your tumor is one goal
of your team. But other goals could include
improving your overall well-being, maintaining
your ability to do day-to-day activities, reducing
pain, getting good nutrition, and lowering
stress and anxiety. Your multidisciplinary care
team will meet to discuss your treatment and
which options are best for you.

Create a medical binder

Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays
to destroy tumor cells and stop them from
increasing in number.

A medical binder or notebook is a great way
to organize all of your records in one place.

Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy
tumor cells and stop them from
increasing.

Bring your binder to all your medical
appointments. Records of your tests and
images can be immensely helpful to your
treatment team. Having all your records in
one place will also be helpful when getting

Low-grade gliomas are less

Tumor surgery

common than high-grade gliomas.

Although low-grade gliomas grow slowly, many
eventually become high-grade gliomas. The
main goal of treatment is to prevent or delay
that from happening. The primary treatment for
a low-grade glioma is surgery to remove the
tumor (resection). Your treatment team may
be able to tell from your MRI whether all of the
tumor or part of the tumor can be removed.

They also have a better prognosis.
Some low-grade gliomas
eventually evolve into high-grade
gliomas.



About low-grade gliomas
Low-grade gliomas include a variety of
slow-growing grade 1 and grade 2 tumors.
Low-grade gliomas typically occur in people
between their teens and their 40s, but older
adults can also get low-grade gliomas.
The most common symptom of lowgrade gliomas is seizure (particularly in
oligodendrogliomas). Other symptoms
include headaches, muscle weakness, vision
problems, and changes in mental function
or behavior. However, many people with
low-grade gliomas have no symptoms. Their
tumors are often found during unrelated
medical tests.



Gross total resection – A gross total
resection is a surgical procedure that
removes all, or nearly all, of the visible
tumor. Ideally, the whole tumor can be
removed. Removing the whole tumor
is likely to help you live longer. It also
helps to delay a low-grade glioma from
becoming a high-grade glioma. Plus, it
can further reduce seizures and other
symptoms.
Partial resection – Sometimes
the tumor can’t be removed entirely.
Removing part of the tumor is called
a partial resection. Your surgeon may
recommend a second surgery later on to
try to remove the whole tumor.

Pathology
Whether or not the whole tumor is removed, a
sample of it will be sent to a neuropathologist.
The neuropathologist will identify the type of
glioma and test it for certain biomarkers. These
results can also indicate the type of treatment
you may need.

If your MRI scan shows what appears to be a
low-grade glioma, the best possible plan is to
remove the tumor surgically.

The most common low-grade gliomas in adults
are astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

32

4 Treatment for low-grade glioma » Low-grade astrocytoma

Low-grade astrocytoma



Low-grade astrocytomas are slow-growing,
diffuse grade 2 tumors. (Grade 1 astrocytomas
usually occur only in children.) A diffuse (or
infiltrative) tumor weaves into the surrounding
normal brain tissue. This gives the tumor
unclear, indistinct edges. As a result, a diffuse
tumor is difficult to remove entirely by surgery.



Most diffuse astrocytomas in adults occur
in the frontal or temporal lobes of the brain.
Common symptoms are seizures and
headaches. Other symptoms due to pressure
on the brain are vision changes, nausea, and
vomiting. Then again, a low-grade astrocytoma
may cause no symptoms.

Biomarkers
Biomarkers help identify the glioma type and
help guide treatment.


High risk – A person who is over age
40 or has had a partial resection (or an
open biopsy or a stereotactic biopsy)
typically has a high risk for the tumor to
regrow. Additional treatment for a person
with high risk may involve a clinical
trial. Otherwise, adjuvant treatment is
usually radiation therapy followed by
chemotherapy (PCV or temozolomide).
Sometimes, radiation therapy is
both combined with and followed by
temozolomide chemotherapy.

There can be exceptions to these risk
categories. Your care team will also consider
the risks involved due to the tumor’s size and
whether you have any other gene mutations or
neurological problems.

IDH – IDH mutation is a key marker of
astrocytomas. Also, some therapies may
work relatively better in gliomas with an
IDH mutation.

Also, people who are older or who have limited
physical capability (low performance status)
may not be able to handle such aggressive
treatment. They might benefit from less intense
therapy instead. Less intense adjuvant options
include:

Treatment
The main treatment for a low-grade
astrocytoma is a gross total resection to
remove all the tumor or as much of it as
possible.



After surgery, you’ll be reevaluated for your
next type of treatment (called adjuvant
treatment). Your next treatment will be based
on the risk of the tumor to regrow:





NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

Low risk – A person who is under 40
years old and has had a gross total
resection usually has a low risk for
the tumor to regrow quickly. Someone
who has a lower risk tumor may be
recommended for a clinical trial or kept
under observation after surgery.

Supportive (palliative) care

4 Treatment for low-grade glioma » Low-grade oligodendroglioma

Follow-up

Biomarkers

After treatment, you’ll have regular MRI or CT
scans to make sure the tumor hasn’t grown
back. These will be scheduled for every 3
to 6 months at first, and then about every 6
months if the tumor remains stable. The scans
will also monitor the health of your brain and
identify any side effects of radiation therapy or
chemotherapy.

Characteristic biomarkers of
oligodendrogliomas are IDH mutation and
1p/19q co-deletion.




Recurrence



The signs and symptoms of your astrocytoma
may disappear for months or even several
years after treatment. However, most grade 2
astrocytomas eventually evolve over time into
higher-grade astrocytomas. To read about the
recurrence of astrocytomas, see Chapter 6.

1p/19q – All oligodendrogliomas have
1p/19q co-deletion, which is linked to
better results from chemotherapy.
TERT promoter – A TERT promoter
mutation, when it occurs along with
IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion,
helps confirm the diagnosis of
oligodendroglioma.

Treatment
Treatment for a low-grade oligodendroglioma
is similar to that for a low-grade astrocytoma.
Ideally, all or almost all of the tumor should be
surgically removed.

Low-grade
oligodendroglioma

After surgery, you’ll be reevaluated for your
next treatment (called adjuvant treatment).
Your next type of treatment will be based on
the risk of the tumor to regrow:

Low-grade oligodendrogliomas are slowgrowing, grade 2 tumors. (There are no grade
1 oligodendrogliomas.) Oligodendrogliomas
commonly develop in the frontal and temporal
lobes of the brain. Tumors in these areas
can result in symptoms such as seizures,
headaches, weakness, and speech problems.
The most common of these is seizure. About 3
in 5 people with an oligodendroglioma have a
seizure before being diagnosed.





NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

IDH – An IDH mutation is found in all
oligodendrogliomas.

34

Low risk – A person who is under 40
years old and whose tumor has been
removed completely is considered
to have a lower risk for the tumor to
regrow. Someone with a low-risk tumor
could enter a clinical trial or be under
observation after surgery.
High risk – A person who is over age
40 or has had a partial resection is at

Follow-up
After treatment, you’ll have regular MRI or CT
scans to make sure the tumor hasn’t grown.
The usual schedule for follow-up scans is
every 3 to 6 months for a few years, and then
every 6 months if the tumor remains stable.
The scans will also monitor the health of your
brain and identify any side effects of radiation
therapy or chemotherapy.

Seizure is the most common symptom
of low-grade gliomas. However, many
people with low-grade gliomas have no
symptoms.
The main treatment for a low-grade
glioma is surgery to remove all of the
tumor or as much of it as possible.
Grade 2 glioma tumors don’t have clearly
defined edges. This makes them difficult
to remove entirely by surgery.
Oligodendrogliomas are diagnosed by
the combination of two biomarkers: IDH
mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion.
Although low-grade gliomas grow slowly,
many eventually become high-grade
gliomas.

statistics suggest.

About high-grade gliomas

Tumor surgery

Most gliomas that occur in adults are high
grade. High-grade gliomas are malignant
(cancerous), rapidly growing grade 3 or
grade 4 tumors. Grade 3 gliomas include
astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.
Grade 4 gliomas include astrocytomas and
glioblastomas. These are aggressive, lifethreatening gliomas.

The main goal of a resection is to relieve
pressure on the brain and safely remove as
much of the tumor as possible. This is called
maximal safe resection. Your treatment team
will look closely at your MRI scan to decide
whether maximal safe resection is possible for
you. Your team will also consider other factors
to determine the safety of this operation.
These factors may include your performance
status, your age, how fast the tumor is
growing, and more.

Symptoms of grade 3 and grade 4 tumors can
come on quickly. Symptoms may be due to
the tumor as well as the swelling around the
tumor pressing on the brain. This can cause
nausea, vomiting, and severe headaches that
are worse in the morning or in the middle of
the night.

The two possible types of tumor surgery are:


The location of the tumor can also affect
symptoms. For instance, a high-grade tumor
located near the motor cortex of the frontal
lobe can affect movement or cause weakness
on one side of the body. Seizures are another
common symptom of these gliomas.

Maximal safe resection – The goal
of this surgery is to safely remove as
much of the tumor as possible. This may
involve awake surgery during which the
neurosurgeon will stimulate critical areas
of the brain near the tumor. Within a
day or two after the surgery, you’ll have
another MRI scan to find out how much of
the tumor was removed.
Partial resection or biopsy – If your
treatment team thinks maximal resection
isn’t possible or isn’t a good option

5 Treatment for high-grade glioma » High-grade oligodendroglioma

for you, then you might have a partial
resection or a biopsy (stereotactic biopsy
or open biopsy). Within a day or two after
the partial resection, you’ll have another
MRI scan to find out how much of the
tumor remains.

High-grade oligodendrogliomas are typically
rapidly growing, grade 3 gliomas. High-grade
oligodendrogliomas often have a better
prognosis than other high-grade gliomas.

In either type of resection, the neuropathologist
will examine the tissue sample from your
tumor. Histologic and biomarker tests will
indicate what type of glioma you have.

Oligodendrogliomas may appear almost
anywhere in the central nervous system but
often develop in the frontal or temporal lobes
of the brain.

Types of high-grade glioma tumors include
oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, and
glioblastomas.

Biomarkers
Molecular testing can reveal specific
biomarkers that may enhance the diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment of a high-grade
oligodendroglioma. Notably, the combination
of an IDH mutation and a 1p/19q co-deletion is
necessary to diagnose an oligodendroglioma.

Imaging aids surgery
To precisely guide
surgery, a computer
programmed with
imaging scans can
pinpoint the exact
location of a brain tumor.

Treatment

Follow-up

Surgery to try to remove the tumor is the
first step of treatment. Because a high-grade
oligodendroglioma blends into the surrounding
brain tissue, removing the entire tumor usually
isn’t possible. So you’ll have additional
treatment (called adjuvant treatment) to
destroy as many of the remaining tumor cells
as possible.

After treatment, you’ll need to have regular
MRI scans to find out if the oligodendroglioma
is under control. These scans can also monitor
the health of your brain and identify any side
effects of radiation or chemotherapy. Scans
are scheduled every 2 to 4 months for a few
years, and then every 3 to 6 months if there’s
no recurrence.

You can consider joining a clinical trial to
receive additional treatment. If a clinical trial
isn’t an option, then the adjuvant treatment
for a high-grade oligodendroglioma is usually
radiation plus chemotherapy.

Recurrence
A high-grade oligodendroglioma is likely to
come back eventually. When it does, it may
be even more aggressive. For more about
recurrence, see Chapter 6.

Your treatment team may recommend one of
these options:


Radiation therapy either before or after
PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, and
vincristine) chemotherapy

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

39

5 Treatment for high-grade glioma » High-grade astrocytoma

High-grade astrocytoma



High-grade (grade 3 and grade 4)
astrocytomas are rapidly growing gliomas. The
cells in these tumors have changed so much
that they no longer look like normal glial cells.
In addition, grade 4 astrocytomas often have
necrosis, which is an area of dead tumor
tissue. Grade 4 astrocytomas can also grow
a large amount of new blood vessels, which
feed their fast growth. Finding either or both
of these features suggests the astrocytoma
is more severe and is growing faster than a
grade 3 astrocytoma.

Treatment
Surgery to try to remove the tumor (either
maximal or partial resection) is the first step of
treatment for a high-grade astrocytoma.
Because high-grade astrocytomas invade the
surrounding brain tissue, removing the entire
tumor won’t be possible. So additional (also
called adjuvant) treatment is needed. The
purpose of additional treatment is to destroy as
many of the remaining tumor cells as possible.

High-grade astrocytomas occur in almost any
part of the central nervous system. But they’re
most often located in the brain’s frontal or
temporal lobes.

Your additional treatment could be receiving
therapy in a clinical trial. NCCN experts
recommend that anyone with a high-grade
glioma consider a clinical trial for adjuvant
treatment. If a clinical trial isn’t available or
possible, then additional treatment usually
means radiation plus chemotherapy.

Biomarkers
Specific biomarkers of high-grade
astrocytomas include:






IDH – An IDH mutation in a high-grade
astrocytoma generally indicates longer
survival and a better outcome from
radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
ATRX – An ATRX mutation that occurs
with an IDH mutation can help confirm the
diagnosis of astrocytoma.
MGMT promoter methylation – In
high-grade astrocytomas, temozolomide
chemotherapy generally works better
in tumor cells with a methylated
MGMT promoter than in those with an
unmethylated MGMT promoter.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

CDKN2A/B – Deletion of CDKN2A
and CDKN2B genes is a trait that helps
diagnose grade 4 astrocytomas. This is
important to know because a grade 4
astrocytoma grows more quickly and has
a more serious prognosis than lowergrade astrocytomas.

What is the blood-brain barrier?
Your brain is a very important organ. It needs special protection to keep it safe and healthy.
To block germs, infections, and other toxins from getting in, the brain has a unique security
system. This protective layer is called the blood-brain barrier. It’s like a moat that surrounds
and protects a castle.
The blood-brain barrier does its job well—maybe too well. One problem with the barrier is that
it won’t permit most drugs in the blood to reach the brain. This includes many chemotherapy
drugs. However, scientists have learned that some chemotherapy drugs can cross the bloodbrain barrier more easily than others. Some of these drugs are used to treat gliomas.
Even so, doctors and scientists are constantly investigating new and better ways to send
drugs through the blood-brain barrier to reach brain tumors.

5 Treatment for high-grade glioma » Glioblastoma

Glioblastoma



Glioblastomas are fast-growing and aggressive
grade 4 tumors. They’re the most common and
the most dangerous type of malignant brain
tumor in adults.
Glioblastomas don’t usually evolve from lowergrade gliomas—they typically emerge as grade
4 tumors right from the beginning (de novo).
Glioblastomas can occur anywhere in the brain
or spinal cord, but they develop most often in
the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain.



Glioblastomas are highly infiltrative—they
expand and merge deep into the surrounding
brain tissue.

As with other gliomas, the first treatment for
glioblastoma is to try to surgically remove
most of the tumor. But because glioblastoma
cells invade so deeply into brain tissue,
removing the entire tumor won’t be possible.
So additional treatments are needed. In
some individuals, carmustine wafers could
be inserted after the tumor tissue is surgically
removed.

Biomarkers

The purpose of additional treatment (also
called adjuvant treatment) is to destroy as
many of the remaining tumor cells as possible.
NCCN experts highly recommend that people
with glioblastoma consider a clinical trial as
part of their treatment plan. If a clinical trial
isn’t possible or available, additional treatment
usually involves radiation, chemotherapy, and
other therapies.

A glioblastoma has one or more of these
biomarkers:





IDH – One clue to identifying a
glioblastoma is that it doesn’t have an
IDH mutation.
TERT promoter – Most glioblastomas
have a mutation in the TERT promoter.
Finding this biomarker helps predict the
prognosis of the disease.

Adjuvant treatment for older adults (over
age 70) is often different than treatment for
adults under age 70. In general, older adults
are given less intense treatment. There are
several reasons for this. Many older adults
have additional health problems, limited

7 gain/10 loss – The combination
of gaining chromosome 7 and losing
chromosome 10 is a strong identifying
biomarker of glioblastoma.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

EGFR – Mutations in the EGFR gene occur
frequently in glioblastoma, which makes
this a helpful biomarker for diagnosis.

Treatment

Glioblastomas are characterized by areas of
dead cells (necrosis). They also produce a
large amount of new blood vessels to feed
their fast growth. Because glioblastomas grow
quickly, they need to be diagnosed and treated
as soon as possible.



MGMT promoter methylation –
Nearly half of glioblastomas have MGMT
promoter methylation. Finding this
biomarker is important for treatment. A
glioblastoma with a methylated MGMT
promoter tends to respond better to
temozolomide chemotherapy and leads
to longer survival compared with a
glioblastoma with an unmethylated MGMT
promoter.

What is pseudoprogression?
Pseudoprogression occurs when imaging scans show that the tumor appears to be growing
after treatment, but what looks like tumor growth on the images is actually a reaction to
treatment.
It can be difficult for your doctors to tell the difference between pseudoprogression and real
tumor progression based on imaging alone. This is a common situation, and it can be very
stressful. Additional imaging or having another biopsy or surgery may be necessary to confirm
whether the tumor is truly progressing.

You may eventually reach a point where you
want to stop treatment. For some people, how

Anxiety and depression

The main concern for most patients with
cancer is to find a treatment that works. Having
cancer is about more than just treatment,
though. Cancer care can be a rollercoaster
that includes many additional physical and
emotional challenges. It’s important to know
that you can get support for these challenges.

Depression, anxiety, fear, and distress are very
common feelings for people with gliomas—as
well as their loved ones and caregivers. You
may feel anxious or experience depression
during a hard part of treatment or because
your life is different than it was before your
brain tumor. These feelings can make it harder
to deal with a brain tumor and with tumor
treatment. They can hold you back even when
you want to move forward.

Supportive care (also called palliative care) is
for controlling cancer symptoms, relieving the
suffering that comes with the diagnosis and
treatment of cancer, and improving the quality
of life for those with cancer and their loved
ones and/or caregivers.

Tell your treatment team if you're experiencing
these symptoms. Getting help when you’re
feeling worried or hopeless is an important
part of your care. Help can include support
groups, talk therapy, or medication. Patient
navigators, social workers, and other experts
at your medical center can help. Some people
also feel better by exercising, talking with loved
ones, or relaxing.

Supportive care is given at any stage of
disease, not just at the end of life.
Supportive care involves the whole person,
not just their cancer. Supportive care
addresses many needs. Notably, supportive
care can help prevent or treat physical and
emotional symptoms. It can assist with making
treatment decisions and coordinating care
between health providers. It can provide aid

Do whatever you can to connect
with a support group. Being
diagnosed with a brain tumor can
be scary. It is priceless to be able
to discuss diagnosis, treatment, or
living with a tumor with someone
who has gone through similar
experiences as you have.”

Support groups
Financial concerns

Many people diagnosed with a brain tumor find
support groups to be helpful. A support group
provides the opportunity to talk with others
who are going through, or have been through,
similar experiences. Support groups often
include people at different stages of treatment.
Some people may be newly diagnosed, while
others may be finished with treatment.

The financial cost of a brain tumor can be
overwhelming. As a result, many people with
brain tumors and their loved ones struggle with
the cost of treatment, as well as the stress of
paying for it.
If you struggle to pay for food, housing,
treatment, follow-up care, and other expenses,
or you have difficulty getting to appointments,
talk with your care team’s social worker,
patient navigator, and hospital financial
services staff. Many patient advocacy groups
also have resources. They can help you find
financial support and transportation options.

In a support group, people with common
ground share information on their experiences,
financial and emotional burdens, coping
strategies, and knowledge about research
and treatments. A support group can also be
a good source of practical advice and helpful
tips.
Ask your doctors or supportive care team
about finding a brain tumor support community.
If your hospital or community doesn’t have
support groups for people with brain tumors,
have a look at the online resources listed on
page 65 of this book.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Glioma, 2024

You can also talk to your treatment team about
time off from work, health insurance, or money
problems. Your team can include information in
your treatment plan to help you manage your
finances and medical costs. If your doctors and
care providers don’t talk about how to pay for
treatment, it’s OK for you to ask them about it
first.

7 Supportive care » Survivorship » Advance care planning

“

Survivorship
Survivorship focuses on the health and wellbeing of a person with a brain tumor, from
diagnosis until the end of life. This includes
the physical, mental, emotional, social, and
financial effects of the brain tumor that begin
at diagnosis, continue through treatment, and
arise afterward.

Report any unusual feelings
of sadness, loss of interest in
activities, anxiety, and sleep
problems to your doctor. Many
people experience these feelings,
and they should not go untreated.”

Survivorship also includes concerns about
follow-up care, late effects of treatment, tumor
recurrence, and quality of life. Support from
family members, friends, and caregivers is also
an important part of survivorship.

Advance care planning
When a glioma is diagnosed at an advanced
stage or keeps progressing despite all
treatment efforts, it may be time to consider
what lies ahead. Even when brain tumors are
curable, talking about future scenarios should
begin when starting treatment. This exploration
of what’s important to you is called advance
care planning.

Read more about survivorship in NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Survivorship Care
for Healthy Living and Survivorship Care for
Cancer-Related Late and Long-Term Effects,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Advance care planning is for everyone, not
just for those who are very sick. Advance care
planning means deciding what care you would
want if you become unable to make medical
decisions for yourself. It’s about making
sure that your wishes are understood and
respected. Patients with brain tumors can set
up an advance care plan early to help them
feel less stressed and better able to cope with
their condition.

7 Supportive care » End-of-life considerations » Key points

“

End-of-life considerations
End-of-life care provides medical,
psychological, and spiritual support for people
who are close to the end of life as well as the
people who love them. The goal is comfort, not
a cure. It may also be called comfort care or
hospice.

Don’t be afraid to accept help from
friends and family.”

Note that hospice is a special kind of endof-life care. Hospice refers specifically to
an insurance benefit for people whose life
expectancy is 6 months or less. Hospice
supports those at the end of life by bringing in
additional care providers and resources such
as home care.

Key points




Providing support for family members is a
key part of hospice care. Most programs offer
counseling and support groups for family
members, including support after the patient
has died. It can be very comforting to know
that your loved ones will have that kind of
support after you’re gone.

care, advance care planning, and endof-life concerns, see NCCN Guidelines for

8 Making treatment decisions » It’s your choice » Questions to ask

It’s important to be comfortable

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your care
team. If you can build a relationship with
your care team, you’ll feel supported when
considering options and making treatment
decisions.

with the treatment you choose.
This choice starts with having an
open and honest conversation
with your care team.

Second opinion

It’s your choice

It’s normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While treatment for a glioma
shouldn’t be postponed or ignored, there is
usually enough time to have another care
provider review your test results and suggest a
treatment plan. This is called getting a second
opinion. It’s a normal part of health care. Even
doctors get second opinions!

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your team.

opinion:

decision-making:

Your religious and spiritual beliefs
Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy

Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the provider or specialist
you will see for your second opinion.

Questions to ask

Your feelings about pain or side effects
Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work

Possible questions to ask your care team are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these or come up with your own. Be clear
about your goals for treatment and find out
what to expect from treatment.

Quality of life and length of life
How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
