About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,
Version 1.2023 – November 9, 2022.

Blood cells have important jobs. Red blood
cells (RBCs) carry oxygen throughout the
body. White blood cells (WBCs) fight infections.
Platelets (PLTs) help control bleeding.

Blood
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type
of blood cancer. Blood is a tissue. A tissue is
a group of cells that work together to perform
a function. Blood’s function is to move oxygen
and nutrients throughout the body and carry
away waste. Blood also plays an important

Blood cells are being replaced in your body all
the time. Many have a short lifespan. Some
white blood cells live less than one day. Your
body makes one million red blood cells every
second!

Blood stem cells
Bone marrow
contains stem
cells. A blood
stem cell is an
immature cell that
can develop into
a red blood cell,
white blood cell,
or platelet.

ALL basics » Blood

How blood cells are formed

These are called progenitor cells or precursor
cells.

Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue in
the center of most bones. Inside your bone
marrow are early blood-forming cells called
blood (hematopoietic) stem cells. All types of
blood cells are created from blood stem cells.
At any given time, bone marrow will have cells
in various stages of development, from very
immature to almost fully mature. This process
is called differentiation. After a blood stem cell
develops into a red blood cell, white blood cell,
or platelet, it is released in your bloodstream
as needed.

There are different types of progenitor cells:




Lymphoid progenitor cells form
into lymphoblasts that mature into
lymphocytes
Myeloid progenitor cells from into
myeloblasts and other non-lymphoid
blood cells

ALL is thought to arise in lymphoid progenitor
cells.

Blood stem cells can copy themselves or “selfrenew.” These cells are rare. The role of blood
stem cells is to make cells that will become red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

Lymphocytes

ALL can be found in bone marrow, blood, and
organs such as the testicles or the central
nervous system.

A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell
found in blood and lymph tissue, as well as
all organs in the body. Lymph tissue includes
lymph vessels and lymph nodes. Lymphocytes
help fight and prevent infection.

There are 2 types of ALL:

There are 3 main types of lymphocytes:






B cell or B-ALL



T cell or T-ALL

Within each type there are several subtypes,
which are based mainly on:

B lymphocytes or B cells make
antibodies. An antibody is a protein.



T lymphocytes or T cells help fight
infections, kill tumor cells, and control
immune responses.
Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor
cells or virus-infected cells.



ALL most often affects B cells or T cells.

The type of lymphocyte (most often B cell
or T cell) within the leukemia cells and
how mature the cells are. This is known
as the immunophenotype of the leukemia.
If the leukemia cells have specific gene or
chromosome changes.

B-ALL
B-cell ALL or B-ALL starts in B-cell
lymphocytes. B-ALL is more common than
T-ALL. Mature B-cell ALL (also called Burkitt
leukemia), a rare subtype, is essentially
the same as Burkitt lymphoma (a type of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma), but is treated
differently from B-ALL. In some cases, the
B-cell lymphoblasts grow mostly in the lymph
nodes instead of in the bone marrow. When
this happens, it is called B-cell lymphoblastic
lymphoma, B-LL, or B-LBL.

Acute lymphoblastic
leukemia
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fastgrowing blood cancer that starts in diseasefighting lymphocytes of your immune system.
In ALL, bone marrow makes too many
immature lymphocytes called lymphoblasts.
Lymphoblasts can crowd out other blood cells
causing blood to not work as it should. Acute
leukemias grow faster than chronic leukemias.

T-ALL

In general, to be diagnosed with ALL, 20
percent (20%) or more lymphoblasts must
be present in the bone marrow. This means
that at least 1 out of every 5 marrow cells are
lymphoblasts. In certain cases, a diagnosis
of ALL is possible with less than 20%
lymphoblasts.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023



T-cell ALL or T-ALL starts in T-cell
lymphocytes. T-ALL can cause an enlarged
thymus (a small organ in front of the
windpipe), which can sometimes lead to
breathing problems. In some cases, the T-cell
lymphoblasts grow mostly in the thymus
instead of in the bone marrow. When this
happens, it is called T-cell lymphoblastic
lymphoma, T-LL, or T-LBL.

ALL basics » Pediatric ALL

Pediatric ALL
Pediatric refers to ALL found in infants,
children, and young adults. “Pediatric” includes
anyone 18 years of age or under, and certain
adolescents and young adults (AYAs) over 18
years of age. AYAs are those 15 to 39 years
of age at the time of initial cancer diagnosis.
An AYA can be treated in pediatric or adult
centers depending on the type of cancer. This
book applies to AYAs who are 30 years of age
or under and are being treated at a pediatric
cancer center.

Those with pediatric
ALL should be treated
at experienced pediatric
leukemia centers.

More information for AYAs seeking ALL
treatment at an adult cancer center can be
found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Lymphocytes
A lymphocyte is a type of
white blood cell. In ALL, bone
marrow makes too many
immature lymphocytes called
lymphoblasts.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is
a fast-growing blood cancer. In ALL,
bone marrow makes too many immature
lymphocytes called lymphoblasts. This
makes it hard for bone marrow or blood to
do its work.

Let us know what
you think!

In general, to be diagnosed with ALL,
20 percent (20%) or more lymphoblasts
must be present in the bone marrow.
This means that at least 1 out of every 5
marrow cells are lymphoblasts.

Testing for ALL » General health tests

General health tests

Family history
Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your child's doctor will ask about
the health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history. Ask family members on both
sides of your family about their health issues
like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes,
and at what age they were diagnosed. It’s
important to know the specific type of cancer,
or where the cancer started, and if it is in
multiple locations.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments your child has had in
their life. Be prepared to list any illness or
injury and when it happened. Bring a list of
old and new medicines and any over-thecounter medicines, herbals, or supplements
they take. Some supplements interact with
and affect medicines that your child's doctor
may prescribe. Tell your child's doctor about
any symptoms they have. A medical history,
sometimes called a health history, will help
determine which treatment is best for your
child.

Leukemia predisposition
syndrome
Certain genetic changes, or mutations, can
increase a person’s chances of developing
cancer. These changes, known as hereditary
cancer syndromes, can be passed down from
parent to child if related by blood. If your child
is a blood relative, their doctor should do a
thorough family history and ask if anyone
in your family has had leukemia. If there
is a concern for a leukemia predisposition
syndrome, your child might be referred to a
genetic counselor or geneticist. Since bloodrelated family members are often bone marrow
donors, it is important to rule out leukemia
predisposition syndrome.

Physical exam
During a physical exam, a health care provider
may:


Check your child's temperature, blood
pressure, pulse, and breathing rate



Check your child's height and weight



Listen to the lungs and heart



Look in the eyes, ears, nose, and throat





Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
child's body to see if organs are of normal
size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.

Testicular exam
ALL can spread to the testicles and cause
them to swell or become more firm than usual.
A testicular exam is a complete physical exam
of the groin and the genitals, which are the
penis, scrotum, and testicles. A doctor will
feel the organs and check for lumps, swelling,
shrinking, and other signs of ALL.

Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in the
neck, underarm, and groin.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Testing for ALL » Blood tests

Dental exam

Differential

The health of your teeth and gums is important.
Some treatments can cause dental problems.
Therefore, it is important for your child to see a
dentist before and during treatment.

There are 5 main types of white blood
cells: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,
eosinophils, and basophils. A differential
counts the number of each type of white blood
cell (WBC). It also checks if the counts are in
balance with each other and whether leukemia
cells (blasts) are present.

Blood tests
Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require a
sample of blood, which is removed through
a needle placed into a vein. Some of the
possible blood tests you or your child might
have are described next.

Chemistry profile
A chemistry profile or panel measures the
levels of different substances released in your
blood by the liver, bone, and other organs.
When ALL is present, the chemistry panel can
be abnormal.

Blood clotting tests

Creatinine

Your body stops bleeding by turning blood into
a gel-like form. The gel-like blood forms into
a solid mass called a blood clot. Clotting is a
process or series of events. Proteins, called
coagulation factors, are needed for clotting.
They are made by the liver. These tests are
known together as a coagulation panel or
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
panel. An impaired clotting process is common
in leukemia. This is called coagulopathy. Your
child may have bleeding and bruises or blood
clots.

Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles.
Every person generates a fixed amount of
creatinine every day based on how much
muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the
blood tells how well the kidneys are working.
Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys
aren’t working as well as they were when
someone had lower levels of creatinine.

HLA typing
Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are proteins
found on the surface of most cells. They play
an important role in your body’s immune
response. HLAs are unique to each person.
They mark your body’s cells. Your body
detects these markers to tell which cells are
yours. In other words, all your cells have the
same set of HLAs. Each person’s set of HLAs
is called the HLA type or tissue type.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures
the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in
your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells fight
infection, and platelets control bleeding.

HLA typing is a blood test that detects a
person’s HLA type. This test is done before a
donor (allogeneic) blood stem cell transplant.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

14

Testing for ALL » Blood tests

Most children with pediatric ALL do not need
a transplant and, therefore, will not have HLA
typing. To find a donor match, your child's
proteins will be compared to the donor’s
proteins to see how many proteins are the
same. A very good match is needed for a
transplant to be a treatment option. Otherwise,
your child's body will reject the donor cells or
the donor cells will react against their body.
Blood or tissue samples from your child and
your child's blood relatives will be tested first.

Testing takes time. It
might take days or
weeks before all test
results come in.

Lactate dehydrogenase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into blood. Fastgrowing cells, such as tumor cells, also release
LDH.

Potassium
Blood plasma has a low level of potassium
and a high level of sodium, but inside cells
are high levels of potassium and low levels of
sodium. When many cells are breaking down
at the same time, the level of potassium in
the blood can go up. The difference in levels
of potassium inside and outside of cells is
very important to certain processes such as
the electrical signals in the heart. Very high
levels of potassium in the blood can cause
dangerous heart rhythms.

Liver function tests
Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that
are made or processed by the liver. Levels
that are too high or low signal that the liver
is not working well or the bile ducts might be
blocked.

Phosphate

Pregnancy test

Cells have a lot of phosphate in them.
Therefore, when many cells are breaking down
at the same time, the levels of phosphate in
the blood can go up. The kidneys help get rid
of extra phosphate, but too much phosphate
in the blood can also damage the kidneys,
making it harder to get the levels back down to
normal. Since we absorb phosphate from the
foods that we eat, your child might be given a
medicine called a phosphate binder to prevent
phosphate levels from rising too high.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Those who can become pregnant will be given
a pregnancy test before treatment begins.

Screen for opportunistic
infections
An opportunistic infection is an infection that
happens because someone’s immune system
is not working normally. Drug treatment for ALL
can weaken the body’s natural defense against
infections. Your child will be monitored for
opportunistic infections, as needed.

15

Testing for ALL » Fertility (all genders)

Fertility (all genders)

If not treated early, infections can be fatal.
Infections can be caused by bacteria, fungus,
or viruses. Antibiotics can treat bacterial
infections. Antifungal medicines can treat
fungal infections. Your child may be given
antiviral drugs to prevent viral infections.

Treatment with chemotherapy and other forms
of systemic therapy can affect fertility, the
ability to have children. Ask your child's care
team how cancer and cancer treatment might
change your child's fertility. To preserve fertility,
you may need to take action before starting
cancer treatment. Those who want to have
children in the future should be referred to a
fertility specialist to discuss the options before
starting treatment, if possible. It is not always
possible to see a fertility specialist before
starting treatment.

Tumor lysis syndrome panel
Cancer treatment causes cell death. In tumor
lysis syndrome (TLS), waste released by
dead cells builds up in the body causing
kidney damage and severe blood electrolyte
disturbances. Changes in creatinine,
potassium, phosphate, and uric acid levels
can be signs of TLS. These levels are watched
closely when your child is first diagnosed. They
may receive medicine and intravenous fluids to
help prevent the levels from getting too high.

More information on fertility preservation can
be found in NCCN Guidelines for Patients:
Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Uric acid
Uric acid is released by cells when DNA
breaks down. It is a normal waste product
that dissolves in your blood and is filtered by
the kidneys where it leaves the body in the
urine. Too much uric acid in the body is called
hyperuricemia. It can be caused by a fast
turnover of white blood cells. High uric acid
might be a side effect of treatment. Very high
levels of uric acid in the blood can damage
the kidneys. Uric acid levels are watched with
other tumor lysis syndrome levels.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your child's fertility to
be temporarily impaired or interrupted. This
temporary loss of fertility is related to age at
time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment
dose, and treatment length.

16

Testing for ALL » Preventing pregnancy during treatment » Imaging tests

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment

Those with testicles
Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, contraception (birth control)
such as condoms is recommended to prevent
pregnancy during and immediately after cancer
treatment.

Preventing pregnancy during treatment is
important. Cancer and cancer treatment
can affect the ovaries and damage sperm.
Therefore, becoming pregnant or having one's
partner become pregnant during treatment
should be avoided. Hormonal birth control
may or may not be recommended. Ask about
options such as intrauterine devices (IUDs)
and barrier methods. Types of barrier methods
include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps,
and the contraceptive sponge.

Imaging tests
Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
one's body to look for cancer deposits. A
radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report
to your child's doctor. The doctor will discuss
the results with you. While these reports are
available to you through your portal, please
wait to discuss these results with the doctor.
Your child will not have all of the tests listed.

Those with ovaries
Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby
if your child or teen is or becomes pregnant
during treatment. Therefore, birth control to
prevent pregnancy during and after treatment
is recommended. If your child or teen is
pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.

Chest x-ray
An x-ray is a type of radiation. In small doses,
it is used to make pictures of the inside of
the body. A chest x-ray is used to look for a
mediastinal mass, which forms in the space
between the lungs. This area includes the
heart, aorta, esophagus, thymus, trachea,
lymph nodes, and nerves.

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or
“period” may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment. It is still
possible to become pregnant even without
having a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended for those who are sexually
active during and after treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture.

17

Testing for ALL » Lumbar puncture

Contrast

PET scan

Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that
help enhance and improve the images of
several organs and structures in the body. It is
used to make the pictures clearer. The contrast
is not permanent and will leave the body in
one's urine after the test. The types of contrast
vary and are different for CT and MRI.

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans because they use sugar more
quickly than other cells. However, not all
cancer cells will appear on a PET scan. Also,
not all bright spots are cancer. It is normal
for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to
be bright on PET. Inflammation or infection
can also show up as a bright spot. When a
PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a
PET/CT scan. It may be done with one or two
machines depending on the cancer center.

Tell the doctors if your child has had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past, especially
to iodine or shellfish like shrimp. This is
important. Your child might be given medicines
to avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if your child has a serious
allergy or if their kidneys aren’t working well.

Scrotal ultrasound

MRI scan

A scrotal ultrasound uses sound waves to
make images of the scrotum. The scrotum
is the pouch of skin at the base of the penis
that contains the testicles. The images are
recorded on a computer.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. During the test, your child will
likely be asked to hold their breath for 10 to 20
seconds as the technician collects the images.
Young children who require an MRI but cannot
hold still easily may be given sedation to get a
good quality picture.

Lumbar puncture
A lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure
that removes spinal fluid. It is also called a
spinal tap. A lumbar puncture at diagnosis
is used to rule out a central nervous system
(CNS) disease. Leukemia can travel to the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the
spine or brain. This may cause symptoms. In
order to look for leukemia cells in your child's
spinal fluid, a sample must be taken and
tested. A lumbar puncture is also used to inject
cancer drugs into spinal fluid. This is called
intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy. All treatment
plans include IT chemotherapy.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnet top and bottom, which allows for an
opening on each end. Closed MRIs are more
common than open MRIs, so if your child has
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to their doctor about
it. Also, tell your child's doctor if they have any
metal in their body.

Heart tests

Tissue tests

Electrocardiogram

An aspirate or a biopsy is the removal of a
sample of tissue or group of cells for testing.
A diagnosis of ALL is confirmed using a bone
marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy.

An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows
electrical changes in the heart. It reveals
information about heart rate and rhythm. For
this test, small patches will be placed on your
child's chest to track their heartbeat.

Bone marrow tests
Leukemia starts in the bone marrow. To
diagnose ALL, samples of bone marrow must
be removed and tested to confirm the disease
and to see how well treatment is working. For
many, this is a painful procedure. The care
team will try to make your child as comfortable
as possible. In some places, sedation or
anesthesia is provided during this procedure.
Discuss the options with the care team.

Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram (or echo) uses sound
waves see how well the heart is working. A
wand (called a transducer) with gel on its tip
will be slid across part of your child's bare
chest. Their beating heart will be seen on a
screen. The pictures will be recorded for future
viewing.

A hematologist is a doctor who specializes
in blood diseases and cancers. A
hematopathologist is a doctor who specializes
in blood diseases by looking at cells under a
microscope. The hematopathologist will study
the results of various blood and bone marrow
tests and write a report that will be sent to your
child's doctor.

Cardiac nuclear medicine scan
A nuclear heart scan is an imaging test that
uses special cameras and a radioactive
substance called a tracer to create pictures of
the heart. The tracer is injected into the blood
and travels to the heart.

There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that
are often done at the same time:


Bone marrow aspirate



Bone marrow biopsy

Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding
liquid. An aspirate takes some of the liquid out
of the sponge, and a biopsy takes a piece of
the sponge.
Samples are usually taken from the back or
front of the hip bone (pelvis). Your child will
likely lie on their belly, back, or side. Their
doctors will first clean and give sedation or
numb the skin and outer surface of the bone.
For an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed

markers on cells, particularly in the immune
system (called immunophenotyping).

through their skin and into the bone. Liquid
bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe.
For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to
remove a core sample. Your child may feel
bone pain at your hip for a few days. Their skin
may bruise.

Immunophenotyping
Immunophenotyping (said immuno-feenotyping) uses antibodies to detect the presence
or absence of white blood cell antigens. These
antigens are proteins that can be found on the
surface of or inside white blood cells. They
are called markers or biomarkers. Certain
biomarkers are targeted in ALL treatment.
Immunophenotyping is used to pinpoint the
type of ALL.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry is a laboratory method used to
detect, identify, and count specific cells. Flow
cytometry involves adding a light-sensitive dye
to cells. The dyed cells are passed through
a beam of light in a machine. The machine
measures the number of cells, things like the
size and shape of the cells, and proteins on
the surface of thousands of cells.

Based on immunophenotype, ALL can be
placed into 2 general groups:

A blood test can count the number of white
blood cells, but it cannot detect the subtle
differences between different types of blood
cancers. Flow cytometry can detect these
subtle differences. The most common use
of flow cytometry is in the identification of

into B-lymphocytes. Subtypes include early
precursor B-cell (early pre–B-cell) and
pre–B-cell. Mature B-cell ALL (Burkitt
lymphoma) is a rare subtype and is treated
differently.

A sample of your child's blood or bone marrow
will be used to see if the ALL cancer cells have
any specific mutations. This is separate from
the genetic testing for mutations that your child
may have inherited from you, if blood-related.

T-ALL

ALL cells can have changes in genes and
chromosomes. Mutation testing using methods
such as karyotype, FISH, PCR, and nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) are used to look
for these changes or abnormalities. Your child
may be placed into a risk group based on the
types of genetic abnormalities found. Some
mutations may determine the type of treatment
your child needs. Their care team will explain
any genetic abnormalities or mutations and
how it may affect their risk and treatment.

T-ALL starts in lymphoblasts that would
normally develop into T-cell lymphocytes. This
type is less common. Early T-cell precursor
(ETP-ALL) is a distinct subtype of T-ALL that is
typically treated the same as other subtypes of
T-ALL.

Biomarker tests
Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of
46 chromosomes. Each chromosome contains
thousands of genes. Genes are coded
instructions for the proteins your cells make. A
mutation is when something goes wrong in the
genetic code.

Karyotype
A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes.
Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
A karyotype will show extra, missing
(deletion), translocated, or abnormal pieces
of chromosomes. Since a karyotype requires
growing cells, a sample of bone marrow or
blood must be used.

Biomarker testing is sometimes called
molecular testing, tumor profiling, gene
expression profiling, or genomic testing. It
includes tests of genes or their products
(proteins) and identifies the presence or
absence of mutations and certain proteins.
Proteins are written like this: BCR. Genes are
written with italics like this: BCR.

FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. For
example, the probes attach to the BCR gene
and the ABL1 gene. The BCR::ABL1 gene
is detected when the colors of the probes
overlap by translocation. A translocation is the
switching of parts between two chromosomes.
The BCR::ABL1 translocation can also be
written as t(9;22).

For a list of ALL subtypes and some of the
genetic abnormalities found in pediatric ALL,
see Guide 2.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Testing for ALL » Biomarker tests

PCR

FISH can look for translocations that are too
small to be seen with other methods. It can
only be used for known changes. It cannot
detect all the possible changes found with
a karyotype. Since this test doesn’t need
growing cells, it can be performed on either a
bone marrow or blood sample. Sometimes, a
bone marrow sample is needed to get all the
information your child's doctor needs to help
plan their care.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions
of copies of one's DNA or RNA (genetic
information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find
1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000
normal cells. These copies, called PCR
product, might be used for NGS. A real-time
or reverse transcriptase (RT) is a type of PCR
used to look for BCR::ABL1.

Guide 2
ALL subtypes
• B-ALL or B-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL)
• Not otherwise specified (NOS)
• Hyperdiploidy (leukemia cells with 51 to 67 chromosomes)
• Hypodiploidy (leukemia cells with fewer than 44 chromosomes)
• Intrachromosomal amplification (too many copies) of a portion of
chromosome 21 (iAMP21)

B-ALL subtypes

Any of the above subtypes with:
• t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2) translocation that results in BCR::ABL1
• t(v;11q23.3) translocation that results in KMT2A rearranged
• t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1) translocation that results in ETV6::RUNX1
• t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation that results in TCF3::PBX1
• t(5;14)(q31.1;q32.3) translocation that results in IGH::IL3

Testing for ALL » Biomarker tests

Next-generation sequencing

Insertions

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a
method used to determine a portion of a
person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene
has any mutations that might affect how the
gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more
detailed way than other methods, and can find
mutations that other methods might miss.

When a new part of a chromosome or gene is
included, it is called an insertion.

Amplifications
When a part or whole chromosome or gene is
increased (for example, duplicated), it is called
an amplification.

ALL cells can have changes in genes and
chromosomes. Mutation testing looks for
these changes or abnormalities. By testing
karyotype, FISH, RT-PCR, and NGS,
chromosome or gene abnormalities that are
unique to ALL cells are found. Examples of
such changes are called deletion, insertion,
amplification, translocation (rearrangement),
and point mutation.

Translocations and
rearrangements
Translocation is a switching of parts between
two chromosomes. If this is explained at
the gene level, it is called rearrangement.
The Philadelphia chromosome occurs with
translocation between chromosome 9 and
22 and is written as t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) in the
chromosome level and BCR::ABL1 in the gene
level. The detailed explanation is shown in the
image below.

Deletions
When part of a chromosome or gene is
missing, it is called a deletion.

Other common translocations in ALL include
t(v;11q23.3) written as KMT2A rearranged
and t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1) written as
ETV6::RUNX1.

Philadelphia
chromosome
The Philadelphia
chromosome
is formed by a
translocation
between parts of
chromosomes 9 and
22. it contains the
abnormal BCR::ABL1
fusion gene.

Point mutations

Keep these things in mind

When part of a gene is changed, it is called a
point mutation.

•

Take care of yourself. This is a stressful
time. Make an appointment to see your
doctor. Seek out and ask for support.
Support can be a friend, relative,
neighbor, or coworker.

•

This will be a confusing time. You will
hear a lot of unfamiliar words. Start
conversations with questions and about
your concerns.

•

Encourage your child to interact with
their health care team, to ask questions,
and to talk about how they feel.

•

Teach your teen how and when to
take their medicine, what to do if
their medicine is low, how to refill a
prescription, how to manage side
effects, and who to call if they have
questions about their medicine or
treatment.

•

Explain to your child or teen why taking
medicine is important. Create a chart
so they can keep track of when to take
medicine or use an electronic device to
schedule a reminder.

•

Treating pediatric ALL is complex.
Not everyone responds to treatment
the same way. Some do better than
expected. Others do worse. A treatment
response takes time.

•

Celebrate treatment milestones and
other events. Find ways to engage your
child. Explore new interests together.

Philadelphia chromosome
In the Philadelphia chromosome, a piece of
chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome
22 break off and trade places with each
other. These pieces create a new, abnormal
chromosome 22 that contains a small part
of chromosome 9. This new, abnormal
chromosome 22 is referred to as the
Philadelphia chromosome. You might see it
written as Ph-positive (Ph+).
Chromosomes have many genes. One piece
of chromosome 9 contains a gene called
ABL1. One piece of chromosome 22 contains
a gene called BCR. When these genes
fuse together on chromosome 22, a new
BCR::ABL1 gene is formed. This translocation
is also shown as t(9;22). BCR::ABL1 makes
a new protein that leads to uncontrolled cell
growth. BCR::ABL1 is not found in normal
blood cells. It is not passed down from parents
to children.

Testing for ALL » Genetic and genetic risk testing » Risk groups

Genetic and genetic risk
testing

Risk groups
Treatment options for B-ALL are based on
age, white blood cell counts at diagnosis,
and results of tests done on leukemia cells to
look for gene or chromosome changes. The
presence of certain mutations can sometimes
predict how ALL will respond to certain types
of treatment. How ALL responds to treatment
and if minimal residual disease (MRD) remains
after treatment are also important. Your child
might be placed into a risk group based on risk
factors.

Genetic testing is done using skin, blood
(when ALL cells disappear), or saliva (spitting
into a cup). The goal is to look for gene
mutations inherited from your biological
parents called germline mutations. Some
mutations can put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. You can pass these genes
on to your children. Also, family members
might carry these mutations. Tell your child's
doctor if there is a family history of cancer.

Risk factors include:

There are 3 major types of genetic testing:






Cytogenetic - to examine whole
chromosomes
Biochemical - to measure proteins
produced by genes



Age



White blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis



Molecular - to look for small DNA or
gene mutations and/or gene fusions



While it can be confusing, just know that
testing done to look for an inherited gene
mutation or an inherited risk of cancer is
different than genetic testing done on cancer
cells or testing to look for proteins produced by
cancer cells.

Gene or chromosome mutations,
translocations, deletions, and
rearrangements
Response to therapy often expressed as
minimal residual disease



Predisposition syndrome



Down syndrome

Risk groups and treatment planning are based
on testing lymphoblasts in bone marrow or
blood for specific genetic abnormalities.

Age
ALL tends to be more aggressive in infants
and those 10 years of age and over. Infants
are those under the age of 12 months (1 year).

WBC
A WBC greater than 50,000/μL at initial
diagnosis is considered high risk.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

25

Testing for ALL » Pharmacogenomic testing

B-ALL genetic risk groups

Down syndrome

Your child will be placed into an initial
risk group based on the genetic features
(mutations) found in the leukemia cells.
Some genetic mutations respond better to
treatment. Unfavorable risk features are more
of a challenge to treat. At certain treatment
milestones, risk group might be reassessed by
considering response to treatment.

In Down syndrome, there is an extra
chromosome 21. Instead of two chromosomes,
there are three. There are challenges treating
ALL in those with Down syndrome.

Hyperdiploidy

Pharmacogenomics (said farma-co-geenome-icks) is the study of how genes affect
a person’s response to drugs. How well your
child's body absorbs (metabolizes) drugs is
an important factor in treatment. Not everyone
receives the same dose. Your child's age,
weight, and other factors play a role in the
dose they receive. Therefore, they may have
a test to find the best starting dose of certain
drugs. This test looks for genes that help to
guide dosing decisions.

Pharmacogenomic testing

In hyperdiploidy, leukemia cells have more
than 50 chromosomes. Normal cells have 46
chromosomes.

Hypodiploidy
In hypodiploidy, leukemia cells have fewer
than 44 chromosomes. Normal cells have 46
chromosomes.

Leukemia predisposition
syndrome

Two examples are as follows, which
are related to chemotherapy with
6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine:

Some hereditary cancer syndromes can be
passed down from parent to child. A family
history of leukemia can affect treatment. If a
predisposition condition is suspected, your child
might have a skin punch biopsy. If their blood
was tested at diagnosis, you would see the
genetic changes of the leukemia. Therefore, a
skin punch biopsy is used. In this procedure,
a small piece of skin and connective tissue is
removed to get DNA that hasn’t been altered
by ALL. This will be used to see if your child
has inherited genes that increase their risk of
leukemia. Leukemia predisposition syndrome
can affect how your child's body responds to
treatment. Blood and saliva can be used when
ALL cells disappear (in remission).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023



Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)



Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15)

Based on the results of the test, your child
might start certain types of chemotherapy at a
lower dose to avoid severe myelosuppression.
In myelosuppression, bone marrow activity
is decreased, resulting in fewer red blood
cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
This is supposed to happen with certain
chemotherapies. However, since those with
a genetic mutation in TPMT or NUDT15 may
have more severe myelosuppression, they
may be started on lower doses to prevent this
from happening.

An aspirate or biopsy is the removal of
a sample of tissue or group of cells for
testing. A diagnosis of ALL is confirmed
using a bone marrow aspirate and bone
marrow biopsy.
Immunophenotyping is used to pinpoint
the type of pediatric ALL.
Your child might be placed into a risk
group before starting treatment. Risk
might be reassessed between stages of
treatment.
Factors that can affect treatment include
age, white blood cell count at diagnosis,
gene or chromosome mutations,
response to treatment, predisposition
syndrome, and Down syndrome.
Cancer treatment can affect fertility.
Blood tests check for signs of disease,
how well organs are working, and
treatment results. Blood clotting tests will
also be done.
Imaging tests are used to look for sites
of infection, bleeding, and leukemia
that might have spread outside the
bloodstream.
Heart or cardiac tests are used to see
how well your child's heart works. These
tests might be used to monitor treatment
side effects.
Leukemia can travel to the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) that surrounds the spine or
brain. It can also travel to sites outside of
the blood such as the testicles.

Care team
Treating ALL takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your child's type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your child's treatment. Ask
who will coordinate your child's care.



Some members of your child's care team will
be with you throughout cancer treatment, while
others will only be there for parts of it. Get to
know your child's care team and help them get



Depending on your child's diagnosis, the care
team might include the following:








A diagnostic radiologist interprets the
results of x-rays and other imaging tests.
An interventional radiologist
performs needle biopsies and places

Chemotherapy is a type of systemic drug
therapy that kills fast-dividing cells throughout
the body, including cancer cells and normal
cells. Chemotherapy is the backbone of
pediatric ALL treatment and is often combined
with other drug therapies.

Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional issues. The anxiety a
person feels when diagnosed with cancer
might be managed by a social worker
in some cancer centers. They, or other
designated professionals, can help
navigate the complexities of financial and
insurance stresses.

Chemotherapy, fluids, and blood products
might be given through:



What your child may need



Peripheral intravenous line (PIV)

A central venous catheter (CVC) is a thin, long
tube that is often placed in the chest and goes
into a large vein, such as the neck (jugular)
veins or the veins under the collarbone
(subclavian). The part of the CVC used to
attach to fluids or medicine is visible outside of
the body at all times.

What is working for your child and what is
not

Keep a list of names and contact information
for each member of your child's team. This will
make it easier for you and anyone involved in
your child's care to know whom to contact with
questions or concerns.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

A central venous access device (CVAD) and
central venous catheter (CVC or central line)
are devices inserted into the body through
a vein. This makes it easier to give fluids,
blood products, medicine, and other therapies
directly into the bloodstream. While generally
safe, there are risks for infection and blood
clots. The device may be a catheter (examples
include Hickman and Broviac) or port (port-acath or mediport). Ask which option is best for
your child based on the treatment they will be
receiving.

Your child's physical, mental, and emotional
well-being are important. Work with your child

Certain medicines can also affect the ability of
a drug to do its job. Antacids, heart or blood
pressure medicine, and antidepressants are
just some of the medicines that might interact
with a systemic therapy. Therefore, it is very
important to tell your child's care team about
any medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter
(OTC) drugs, herbals, or supplements your
child is taking. Bring a list with you to every
visit.

PICC
A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC
or PICC line) is a long, thin tube that’s inserted
through a vein in the arm or leg and passed
through to the larger veins near the heart.

PIV
A peripheral intravenous line (PIV) is a small,
short plastic catheter that is placed through
the skin into a vein, usually in the hand, elbow,
or foot. A PIV can be used to give fluids,
medicines, and certain chemotherapies.

Steroids
All ALL treatments include steroids. Steroid
is the short name for corticosteroid. Steroids
are human-made versions of hormones
made by the adrenal glands. The adrenal
glands are small structures found near the
kidneys, which help regulate blood pressure
and reduce inflammation. Steroids also are
toxic to lymphoid cells and are an important
part of pediatric ALL chemotherapy. Steroids
can cause short-term and long-term side
effects. The type of steroids used to treat ALL
are called corticosteroids or glucocorticoids.
Corticosteroids are not the same as the
steroids used by some athletes.

Warnings about herbal
supplements and drug
interactions
You might be asked for your child to stop
taking or avoid certain herbal supplements
when on a systemic therapy. Some
supplements can affect the ability of a drug to
do its job. This is called a drug interaction. It
is critical to speak with your child's care team
about any supplements they may be taking.

treating pediatric ALL. Chemotherapy kills fastdividing cells throughout the body, including
cancer cells. Children and young adults can
tolerate higher doses than adults. However,
with higher doses there are side effects. Your
child will be monitored throughout treatment
for side effects or other unwanted (adverse)
reactions. All chemotherapy drugs may cause
severe, life-threatening, or fatal reactions.

Types of chemotherapy
There are many types of chemotherapy
used to treat ALL. Often chemotherapies
are combined. This is called multi-agent
chemotherapy or a multi-agent regimen.
Each chemotherapy works to kill cancer
cells in a different way, which helps prevent
the cancer from coming back. Each type of
chemotherapy can also cause different side
effects. Talk to the care team about the types
of chemotherapy your child is getting, when
your child will get them, and what side effects
to expect.

Chemotherapy can be given as follows:










Oral (PO) – taken by mouth either as a
liquid or pill
Subcutaneous (SQ) – given under the
skin
Intramuscular (IM) – uses a needle to
inject medicine in the muscle of the arm
or leg (like the flu shot)

These are the main types of chemotherapy
drugs (agents) used to treat pediatric ALL:

IV (intravenous) infusion – given
through a vein using IV push, gravity
infusion, or infusion pump. In an IV
push, a drug is injected quickly over a
few minutes. With a gravity infusion,
medicine is put into a bag that hangs
on a pole, and the pressure of gravity
delivers the medicine into the IV line at
a safe and steady rate. In an IV infusion,
chemotherapy flows through a tube
attached to the catheter. The flow may
be controlled by a machine called an IV
pump. Most IV chemotherapy is given
through a port, CVC, or PICC, but some
can be given through PIVs.

Vincristine (Oncovin, Vincasar)

Treatment overview » Targeted therapy

Targeted therapy

Did you know?

Targeted therapy is a form of systemic therapy
that focuses on specific or unique features of
cancer cells. Targeted therapies seek out how
cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the
body. These drugs stop the action of molecules
that help cancer cells grow and/or survive.

The terms “chemotherapy”
and “systemic therapy” are
often used interchangeably,
but they are not the same.
Chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy are all types
of systemic therapy.

Your child will be monitored throughout
treatment for side effects or other unwanted
(adverse) reactions. As with other systemic
therapies, targeted therapy may cause severe,
life-threatening, or fatal reactions.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor
TKIs that might be used to treat pediatric ALL:

A tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a type of
targeted therapy that blocks the signals that
cause cancer to grow and spread. TKIs might
be used alone or in combination with other
systemic therapies like chemotherapy.
Tyrosine kinases are proteins in cells that are
important for many cell functions. The protein
made by the BCR::ABL1 gene is a tyrosine
kinase. It moves or transfers chemicals,
called phosphates, from one molecule to
another. TKIs block this transfer, which stops
uncontrolled cell growth in ALL.

Dasatinib (Sprycel)



Imatinib (Gleevec)



Nilotinib (Tasigna)



Ponatinib (Iclusig)



Ruxolitinib (Jakafi)

There are other types of targeted therapies
available to treat ALL. Whether or not one is
available or would be helpful for your child
depends on your child's subtype of ALL and
what types of genetic changes your child's ALL
cells have.

TKIs are slightly different from one another, but
they generally work in a similar way. They may
cause different side effects. Your child might
not be given a certain TKI if they have a health
condition, such as lung or heart issues, or
certain mutations.

Treatment overview » Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy

CD19-targeting CAR T-cell
therapy

The immune system is the part of the body
that fights infection. Our immune system
also is supposed to attack cancer cells when
they first develop. Sometimes cancer cells
escape the natural defense of our immune
system. Immunotherapy is drug therapy
that acts like your immune system. Some
types of immunotherapy can increase tthe
activity of your immune system. By doing
so, it improves your body’s ability to find and
destroy cancer cells. Other types of immune
therapy are drugs that work similarly to our
immune system. Immunotherapy can be given
alone or with other types of treatment. As with
other treatments, there is the potential for
complications and life-threatening reactions.

CD19-directed genetically modified autologous
T-cell immunotherapy (CD19-targeting CAR
T-cell therapy) or anti-CD19 CAR T-cell
therapy is made from your own T cells. T cells
will be removed from your body, and in the
lab, a CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) will be
added to them. This programs the T cells to
find cancer cells. The programmed T cells will
be infused back into your body to find and kill
cancer cells. Not everyone will need this type
of treatment.
Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) is a type of CD19targeting CAR T-cell therapy.
More information on CAR T-cell therapy can be
found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Antibody therapy
Antibody therapy uses antibodies to help the
body fight cancer, infection, or other diseases.
Antibodies are proteins made by the immune
system that bind to specific markers on cells or
tissues. There are different types of antibody
therapy. One type is called monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs). mAbs used in cancer
treatment may kill cancer cells directly, block
development of tumor blood vessels, or help
the immune system kill cancer cells. Other
types of antibody therapy include bispecific
T-cell engagers (BiTEs). BiTEs connect cancer
cells to normal immune cells to improve the
way normal immune cells fight the cancer.




Blinatumomab (Blincyto) allows
normal T cells to attack cancerous B
cells by bringing them close together.
Blinatumomab is a BiTE.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) binds
to CD22 on leukemia cells then releases
a toxic agent once it’s inside the cells.

Treatment overview » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from photons, electrons, x-rays, or
protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells
and shrink tumors. It is given over a certain
period of time. Radiation therapy can be given
alone or with certain systemic therapies. It may
be used as supportive care to help ease pain
or discomfort caused by cancer.

Treatment overview » Hematopoietic cell transplant

Hematopoietic cell
transplant

The timing of a
hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT)
depends upon donor
availability and your
child’s health at the time
of potential HCT.

A hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) replaces
hematopoietic stem cells that have been
destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/
or radiation therapy as part of the transplant
process. A hematopoietic stem cell is an
immature cell that can develop into any type of
blood cell. You might hear it called a stem cell
transplant (SCT) or a bone marrow transplant
(BMT). This book will refer to it as HCT. HCTs
are performed in specialized centers. Only a
small number of those with pediatric ALL will
receive an HCT.

After conditioning, your child will receive a
transfusion of the healthy stem cells from
a donor that has been matched to them.
A transfusion is a slow injection of blood
products into a vein. This can take several
hours. The transplanted stem cells will travel
to your child's bone marrow and grow. New,
healthy blood cells will form. This is called
engraftment. It usually takes about 2 to 4
weeks. Until then, your child will have little
or no immune defense. Your child may need
to stay in a very clean room at the hospital
or be given antibiotics to prevent or treat
infection. Transfusions are also possible. A red
blood cell transfusion is used to treat anemia
(below normal red blood cell count). A platelet
transfusion is used to treat a low platelet
count or bleeding. While waiting for the cells
to engraft, your child will likely feel tired and
weak.

There are 2 types of HCTs:




Autologous – stem cells come from
your child.
Allogeneic – stem cells come from a
donor that may or may not be related
to your child. Only an allogeneic HCT is
used as a possible treatment option in
ALL.

The timing of an HCT depends upon donor
availability and your child’s health at the time
of potential HCT.

Allogeneic transplant
An allogeneic transplant (alloHCT) uses
healthy stem cells from a donor. The donor
may or may not be related to your child. Before
an HCT, treatment is needed to destroy bone
marrow cells. This is called conditioning and
it creates room for the healthy donor stem
cells. It also weakens the immune system so
your child's body will accept and won’t kill the
transplanted cells. Chemotherapy is used for
conditioning. Radiation therapy may also be
given as part of conditioning treatment.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Possible side effects
Every treatment has side effects. Your child will
be monitored for infections, disease relapse,
and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In
GVHD, the donor cells attack normal, healthy
tissue. There are treatments for GVHD.

Treatment overview » Clinical trials

the results are good, it may be approved
by the FDA.

Ask your child's doctor about
the possible side effects or
complications of HCT and how
this might affect your child's
quality of life.



More information on GVHD can
be found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
for your child outside of the clinical trial at any
time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully
consider all of the treatment options available
for their cancer type, including standard of
care treatments and clinical trials. Talk to your
child's doctor about whether a clinical trial may
make sense for your child.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.






Start the conversation

Phase I trials study the dose, safety, and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.

Don’t wait for your child's doctor to bring up
clinical trials. Start the conversation and learn
about all of your child's treatment options. If
you find a study that your child may be eligible
for, ask the treatment team if your child meets
the requirements. If your child has already
started standard treatment they may not be
eligible for certain clinical trials. Try not to be
discouraged if your child cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard of care treatment. If

Frequently asked questions

Keep a pain diary

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when your child has
pain, how bad it is, what causes it, and
what makes it better or worse. Use a pain
diary to discuss your child's pain with their
care team. You might be referred to a
specialist for pain management.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. You will be informed, verbally and in
writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial
before you enroll your child.

Include in your pain diary:

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, your
child will continue to receive standard cancer
care. This care is billed to—and often covered
by—insurance. You are responsible for copays
and any costs for this care that are not covered
by your insurance.

Treatment overview » Supportive care overview

Supportive care overview
Supportive care will be specific to your child’s
needs. Supportive care is health care that
relieves symptoms caused by cancer or its
treatment and improves quality of life. It might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. When possible, allow your child to
tell their care team about how they are feeling
and about any side effects so they can be
managed. Best supportive care, supportive
care, and palliative care are often used
interchangeably.

It is important to tell
the care team about all
side effects so they can
be managed.

It is very important to eat well, drink plenty of
fluids, play, move, and do things so your child
feels energized. Strength is needed during
treatment. Some potential side effects and
procedures are described next. They are not
listed in order of importance. Some side effects
are very rare.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
child's care team about what late effects could
occur. This will help you know what to look for.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your child's health. Others may just
be unpleasant. Pediatric ALL treatment can
cause a number of side effects. Some are very
serious.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. When treatment
leads to remission (or no evidence of disease),
your child will need follow-up or survivorship
care for late effects. During survivorship care
your child will still have a care team, but it will
look different. Your child will need support.
Seek out peer support groups, whether online
or in-person.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
child's treatments. Also, tell their treatment
team about any new or worsening symptoms.
There may be ways to help your child feel
better. There are also ways to prevent some
side effects. Your child will be monitored
closely for side effects.

Side effects

Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your child's care team will tell
you how to manage diarrhea. It is important to
drink lots of fluids.

Anemia, neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia
Some cancer treatments can cause low blood
cell counts.






Difficulty eating

Anemia is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to
your cells. You might tire easily if you are
anemic.

Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or its treatment might cause your child to
feel not hungry or sick to their stomach
(nauseated). Your child might have a sore
mouth. Healthy eating is important during
treatment. It includes eating a balanced diet,
eating the right amount of food, and drinking
enough fluids. A registered dietitian who is an
expert in nutrition and food can help. Speak to
your child's care team if your child has trouble
eating or maintaining weight.

Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infection.
Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Distress

Blood clots

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping problems
are common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your child's care team and
with those whom you feel most comfortable
about how your child may be feeling. There are
services, people, and medicine that can help
your child. Support and counseling services
are available.

Cancer treatment can cause blood clots to
form. This can block blood flow and oxygen
in the body. Blood clots can break loose and
travel to other parts of the body causing stroke
or other problems.

Cytokine release syndrome
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a
condition that may occur after treatment
with some types of immunotherapy, such
as monoclonal antibodies and CAR T cells.
It is caused by a large, rapid release of
cytokines from immune cells affected by the
immunotherapy. Signs and symptoms of
CRS include fever, muscle aches, nausea,
headache, rash, fast heartbeat, low blood
pressure, and trouble breathing.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side
effect of treatment. Let your child's care team
know how your child is feeling and if fatigue
is getting in the way of them doing the things
they enjoy. Eating a balanced diet and physical
activity can help. Your child might be referred
to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue.

Hand-foot syndrome

other substance. This can include hives, skin
welts, and trouble breathing. An allergy is an
immune reaction to a substance that normally
is harmless or would not cause an immune
response in most people. An allergic response
may cause harmful symptoms such as itching
or inflammation (swelling). Anaphylaxis or
anaphylactic shock is a severe and possible
life-threatening allergic reaction.

Hand-foot syndrome is a common side
effect of chemotherapy. Small amounts of
chemotherapy leak out of very small blood
vessels called capillaries in the palms of the
hands and soles of the feet. It causes redness,
swelling, and pain. Sometimes blisters appear.
You will want to protect your child's hands and
feet by applying moisturizer or lotion.

Infection

High blood pressure

Infections occur more frequently and are more
severe in those with a weakened immune
system. Drug treatment for ALL can weaken
the body’s natural defense against infections. If
not treated early, infections can be fatal.

High blood pressure (HBP or hypertension)
occurs when the force of blood flowing
through your blood vessels is consistently too
high. This can cause headaches and vision
problems. If left untreated, HPB can cause
heart problems and stroke. Steroids can cause
HBP. Medicine might be used to control HBP.

Neutropenia, a low number of white blood
cells, can lead to frequent or severe infections.
When someone with neutropenia also
develops a fever, it is called febrile neutropenia
(FN). With FN, your child's risk of infection may
be higher than normal. This is because a low
number of white blood cells leads to a reduced
ability to fight infections. FN is a side effect of
some types of systemic therapy.

High blood sugar
One possible side effect of steroids is high
blood sugar or hyperglycemia. Glucose (sugar
found in the blood) will be measured. Insulin
might be needed to control high blood sugar.

Hypersensitivity, allergy, and
anaphylaxis

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. Your child will be given medicine
to prevent nausea and vomiting.

Certain treatments can cause an unwanted
reaction. Hypersensitivity is an exaggerated

Treatment overview » Side effects

Neurocognitive or
neuropsychological effects

Osteonecrosis
Osteonecrosis, or avascular necrosis, is death
of bone tissue due to lack of blood supply. It
is a possible side effect of steroids and most
often affects weight-bearing joints, such as the
hip and/or knee.

Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration, memory, and thinking. Survivors
are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be
recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of
your brain affects your thinking and behavior.
Neuropsychological testing can identify your
limits and a health care professional can
create a plan to help with these limits.

Pain
Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. Your child might meet with a
pediatric pain or palliative care specialist
to manage pain. Bone pain and vincristineassociated neuropathic pain are common in
ALL.

Neuropathy
Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment. Most of the
time, neuropathy goes away after treatment.

Pneumonia
Pneumocystis pneumonia is a serious infection
caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Since those with ALL are at high risk, medicine
will be given throughout treatment to prevent
this type of pneumonia.

Neurotoxicity

Tumor lysis syndrome

Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration and memory. Seizures and
confusion can occur. If ALL treatment includes
methotrexate, then your child will be monitored
for methotrexate neurotoxicity (MTX).
Neurotoxicity, such as seizures and confusion,
can be seen with immunotherapy, as well.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) causes an
imbalance of substances in blood. There
are different treatments for TLS. Treatment
depends on what substances are out of
balance and how well your child's kidneys are
working. Sometimes, TLS can cause too much
potassium in your child's blood. Treatment
might include hemodialysis or hemofiltration. A
machine will filter your child's blood.

Organ issues

Weight gain

Treatment might cause your child's kidneys,
liver, heart, and pancreas to not to work as well
as they should.

Weight gain is one side effect of high-dose
steroids. This can be uncomfortable and cause

Antibiotics and treatment
For infection, antibiotics (for bacterial
infection), antifungal medicine (for fungal
infection), and antiviral drugs (for viral
infection) are used. These medications can be
used to prevent infections called prophylaxis.

Transfusions

Dialysis

A transfusion is a common procedure to
replace blood or blood components (red
blood cells or platelets). It is given through
an intravenous line (IV), a tiny tube that is
inserted into a vein with a small needle.

Leukemia cells and chemotherapy sometimes
cause damage to the kidneys. If the damage is
severe, your child may need dialysis. Dialysis
is the process of filtering blood when the
kidneys are unable. There are different types
of dialysis. Hemodialysis and hemofiltration
remove waste and water by circulating blood
outside the body through an external filter.

3 The whole process can take about 1 to

4 hours, depending on how much blood
is needed.

Hyperleukocytosis (leukostasis) is an
extremely high lymphoblast count. Sometimes
those with hyperleukocytosis need to have
a machine remove lymphoblasts from the
blood in a process called leukapheresis. In
leukapheresis, your child may be connected
to a machine called an apheresis machine.
The machine separates white blood cells
(leukocytes) from other blood cells. Once the
excess leukocytes are removed, the blood is
returned to your child's body.

handled, and stored.

3 Most people's bodies handle blood

transfusions very well. But, like any
medical procedure, there are some
risks. Speak with your child's care team
for specific information about the risks.

helps prevent relapse.

Types of response

Phases of treatment

There are different types of treatment
response. When there are no signs of cancer,
it is called a complete response (CR) or
complete remission. This does not always
mean that ALL has been cured. Remission
can be short-term (temporary) or long-lasting
(permanent).

In general, there are several phases of intense
chemotherapy followed by a longer phase of
maintenance chemotherapy. Treatment phases
may include induction, after induction or postinduction phases, and maintenance. However,
not all doctors use the same terms when
discussing treatment. The number of phases
and the type chemotherapy given depend on
the type of leukemia, as well as how your child
responds to the first phases of treatment.

A diagnosis of ALL is based on the presence
of 20 percent (20%) or more lymphoblasts in
the bone marrow. This means that at least 1
out of every 5 marrow cells are lymphoblasts.
However, in some cases a diagnosis of ALL is
possible with less than 20% blasts. Treatment
aims to reduce the number of blasts.

will also need their own support network. Their
network will look different than yours. Support
services such as counseling are also available.
Ask the treatment team for more information.
They are there to help.

Induction is the first phase of treatment. Your
child will likely spend time in the hospital for
part of this treatment. Treatment is a multi-drug
combination of chemotherapies (called multiagent chemotherapy) and steroids.

Post-induction

The goal of induction is a complete response
(CR) or remission. In CR, less than 5% blasts
remain at the end of induction. When induction
does not lead to a complete response, it could
be a sign that this cancer is very difficult to
treat. In many subtypes, how ALL responds to
initial treatment affects prognosis.

After induction, there are multiple phases
of intensive chemotherapy. These postinduction phases are needed to rid the body
of any leukemia cells that might remain called
minimal residual disease (MRD) and aim to
prevent cancer from returning. You might hear
a post-induction phase called consolidation.
The time spent in post-induction phases and
the intensity of the drug regimen will vary. It will
be based on factors such as age, how well ALL
responds to treatment, and risk factors.

After induction, bone marrow aspirate and
biopsy are used to look for a complete
response and to measure the amount of
leukemia cells that might remain called
minimal residual disease.

Minimal residual disease

Maintenance

In minimal residual disease (MRD) very
sensitive lab tests, such as flow cytometry,
PCR, or NGS, find leukemia cells in bone
marrow that cannot be seen under a
microscope. Not all MRD can be found with
tests. Treatment aims to reduce the amount of
MRD.

Maintenance chemotherapy is the final,
and longest, stage of treatment in pediatric
ALL. Treatment is less intensive than prior
chemotherapy. It is given at an outpatient
location. The goal is to lower the risk of
relapse.

What do I need to know?

Parents and caregivers say the induction
phase is the most stressful part of treatment.
There is uncertainty, fear, and confusion.
In addition, there will be a lot of tests,
appointments, and disruption to routine.
Lastly, you will hear a lot of unfamiliar words to
describe a complex disease. Seek out support
groups at your local hospital, through social
media, or from those listed in the back of this
book. Look to friends, relatives, neighbors, and
coworkers for social support. Your child or teen

It is very important for your child to continue
taking their medicine as prescribed and not
miss or skip any doses. This helps to prevent
relapse.

Treatment phases » CNS disease » Surveillance and monitoring » Refractory disease

CNS disease
Tips for preparing your child
for treatment

Treatment to prevent ALL from spreading to
the central nervous system (CNS) is called
CNS prophylaxis or prophylactic treatment.
CNS prophylaxis is typically given throughout
all phases of treatment.

3 Remain relaxed and calm
3 Explain what to expect
3 Use simple language
3 Encourage questions
3 Answer questions truthfully
3 It’s okay to say, “I don’t know”

All treatment plans include intrathecal (IT)
chemotherapy. IT chemotherapy is injected
into spinal fluid. Some treatments include
intrathecal treatment throughout therapy,
whereas others do not include it in later
phase maintenance therapy. Options for IT
chemotherapy include intrathecal methotrexate
or a combination of IT methotrexate,
cytarabine, and hydrocortisone (known as
triple IT chemotherapy). If ALL is found in your
child's CNS at the time of diagnosis, they may
need more IT chemotherapy or radiation to the
brain.

Refractory disease
When leukemia remains in high levels at the
end of induction (EOI) and then does not
respond to post-induction treatment, it is called
refractory or resistant cancer. The cancer may
be resistant at the start of treatment or it may
become resistant during treatment. Refractory
disease is very serious. It is important to ask
about prognosis.

Surveillance and monitoring
Surveillance watches for any changes in your
child’s condition, which includes monitoring for
disease and side effects.

Seek out support groups at
your local hospital, through
social media, or from those
listed in the back of this book.
Look to friends, relatives,
neighbors, and coworkers
for social support. Help your
child or teen find their own
support network. It will likely
look different than yours.

Disease progression

Key points

When the percentage of ALL increases in
blood or bone marrow during treatment,
it is called progressive disease. Disease
progression also occurs when the number
of blasts within the blood or bone marrow
increase by at least 25%.







Relapse
When leukemia returns after a period of
remission, it is called a relapse. The goal
of treatment is to achieve remission again.
Relapse happens in about 1 out of 5 cases.
Ask the care team about your child’s specific
risk of relapse. A relapse is very serious. It is
important to ask about prognosis.





Those with relapsed ALL are placed into risk
groups. Length of first complete remission
(CR1) and site of relapse are two important
factors. Relapse can occur in the bone
marrow called isolated medullary relapse, in
areas outside of the marrow or blood such
the brain (CNS) or testicles called isolated
extramedullary relapse, or a combination of
both.

Induction is the first phase of treatment.
Your child will likely spend time in the
hospital for part of this treatment.
Post-induction therapy is the second
phase of treatment. It is needed to kill
any cancer cells called minimal residual
disease (MRD) that might be left after
induction.
Maintenance therapy is the final phase of
treatment. The goal is to lower the risk of
relapse.
Central nervous system (CNS)
prophylaxis is given to everyone to
prevent ALL from spreading to the brain
and spinal fluid.
Monitoring watches for any changes in
your child’s condition.
ALL that returns after remission is called
relapse. To prevent relapse, it is important
to take medicine as prescribed and not
miss or skip any doses.
When ALL does not respond to treatment
or stops responding to treatment, it is
called refractory or resistant cancer.

Induction

Overview

Many induction treatment regimens are
part of ongoing clinical trials. Induction is a
combination of systemic therapies. Systemic
therapies work throughout the body. All
treatment regimens include systemic therapy
and/or intrathecal therapy (injected into the
spinal fluid) to prevent CNS disease.

Ph-negative (Ph-) and Ph-like B-ALL do not
have the Philadelphia chromosome or the
BCR::ABL1 gene. Before starting treatment,
your child will be placed into a risk group. Risk
is based on white blood cell (WBC) count and
age at diagnosis.




Post-induction

Standard risk is for those with a WBC less
than 50,000/mm³ and who are between 1
and 10 years of age.

Before starting post-induction phases of
treatment, your child will be placed into a risk
group. Risk is based on a variety of factors. A
risk group will determine the treatment with the
best chance of leukemia going into remission
and not relapsing in the future. Treatment
may be partially based on genetic analysis
and whether there is minimal residual disease
(MRD) at the end of induction. A hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT) might be an option if
MRD continues to remain positive.

High risk is for those with a WBC higher
than 50,000/mm³ or who are less than 1
year of age or 10 years of age and older.

For both risk groups, induction will be
chemotherapy given through a clinical trial or
as standard of care. A clinical trial is preferred,
but if one is not available, or you prefer
for your child to not be treated as part of a
clinical trial, the best-known treatment for your
child’s type of ALL will be used. This is called
standard of care. Ask your child's care team
what treatment options are available.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Maintenance
Maintenance chemotherapy is after postinduction. This is usually the longest phase
of therapy and is less intense than previous
phases.

51

Ph-negative or Ph-like B-ALL » Ph-like treatment » MRD+ after induction

Ph-like treatment

MRD+ after induction

Ph-like is a subtype of B-ALL with specific
genetic changes that may be considered high
risk. There are a number of possible mutations
in Ph-like ALL, making it difficult to treat. Phlike ALL might be referred to as BCR::ABL1like ALL.

Treatment response will be measured after
completing induction. The goal is a complete
response (CR). Tests will look for minimal
residual disease (MRD). When MRD is found,
it is called MRD-positive (MRD+). A certain
low level of MRD may be permissible (called
a threshold), but it depends on the treatment.
Ask your child’s care team what this might
mean.

Induction
Many induction treatment regimens are
part of ongoing clinical trials. Induction is
a combination of therapies. All treatment
regimens include systemic and/or intrathecal
therapy to prevent CNS disease. During
induction, your child’s blood will be tested for
genetic mutations. This information is used
to choose the best systemic therapy for postinduction phases.

Treatment
MRD+ is treated with a clinical trial or
chemotherapy. A clinical trial is preferred, if
available.
If MRD remains negative (MRD-) after the first
post-induction phase of chemotherapy, then
your child will continue chemotherapy, followed
by maintenance chemotherapy.

Post-induction

If MRD remains positive (MRD+) after first
post-induction phase chemotherapy, options
include:

When cancer remains after induction, it is
called MRD-positive (MRD+). Depending on
the type of genetic mutation(s) found, tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may be added to
chemotherapy or as part of a clinical trial for
post-induction phases of treatment.

Maintenance
Maintenance chemotherapy is given when no
minimal residual disease remains (MRD-).

marrow called isolated extramedullary relapse,
or a combination of both called combined
relapse. Extramedullary relapse is cancer
found in the central nervous system or
testicles.

Post-induction

The overall treatment plan for T-ALL is the
same as Ph- B-ALL, with induction, postinduction phases, and maintenance. In some
phases, medicine doses and timing may be
different than for B-ALL. Some phases may
also include medicines that work well for
T-ALL, but those with B-ALL do not receive
it. In T-ALL, the goal is to be in complete
remission at the end of the first post-induction
phase, rather than at the end of induction.

Everyone with T-ALL will receive a first postinduction phase treatment before being placed
into a risk group. Risk is based on a variety
of factors. A risk group will determine the
treatment with the best chance of leukemia
going into remission and not relapsing in the
future. Another bone marrow aspirate might
be done if minimal residual disease was found
earlier. A hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
might be an option if MRD remains positive.

Induction

Maintenance

Many induction treatment regimens are part of
ongoing clinical trials. A bone marrow aspirate
will be done at the end of induction to see how
the leukemia responded to therapy. In T-ALL,
not achieveing a complete response at the
end of induction does not affect risk group or
prognosis the way it does in B-ALL.

First relapse

Complete response

T-ALL often returns within 2 years of diagnosis.
When cancer returns after remission, it is
called relapse. Relapse can occur in the bone
marrow called isolated medullary relapse,
in the testicles or central nervous system
called isolated extramedullary relapse, or a
combination of both. Isolated extramedullary
relapse requires systemic therapy to prevent
relapse in bone marrow.

If treatment causes a complete response (CR),
then your child will continue with the same
treatment. A clinical trial is an option. The next
step would be a hematopoietic cell transplant
(HCT).

Less than a complete response
If treatment does not cause a complete
response, then a different treatment will
be given. It might include a clinical trial or
chemotherapy.

Treatment will likely include a combination of
drugs. If relapse is more than 3 years after
initial diagnosis, then the same induction
regimen might be used again.

Multiple relapse

Key points

Relapse can happen multiple times. With each
relapse the goal of treatment is a complete
response.



Treatment options include:


Clinical trial (preferred)



Chemotherapy



Targeted therapy



Treatment response will be checked before
starting consolidation.






If there is a complete response, usually
a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) will
follow.



If less than a complete response, then
treatment might be an alternative therapy
and/or best supportive or palliative care.



Refractory
When cancer remains, it is called MRDpositive (MRD+). When leukemia remains
and does not respond to treatment, it is called
refractory or resistant disease. The cancer
may be resistant at the start of treatment or
it may become resistant during treatment.
Refractory disease is very serious. It is
important to ask about prognosis. Treatment
options for refractory disease or disease that
continues to be MRD+ after consolidation
include chemotherapy, a clinical trial, or an
HCT.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023



63

T-ALL includes a group of cancers that
start in T-cell lymphocytes. T-ALL is less
common than B-ALL.
It is recommended that T-ALL be
treated in a clinical trial, when possible.
Chemotherapy is also a treatment option.
All regimens include central nervous
system (CNS) prophylaxis with systemic
therapy and/or intrathecal (IT) therapy.
The goal of treatment is a complete
response (CR).
After a CR or a hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT), your child will be
monitored for signs of recurrence or
relapse.
When cancer returns or relapses,
treatment is a clinical trial (preferred) or
chemotherapy. The goal of treatment
is to have another CR. After a CR, an
HCT might follow. The timing of an HCT
depends upon donor availability and your
child’s health at the time of potential HCT.
Cancer may be resistant at the start of
treatment or it may become resistant
during treatment. This is called refractory
disease. Treatment for refractory disease
might include chemotherapy, a clinical
trial, or an HCT.

different than other age groups.
Infants are children under 12
months of age.

KMT2A-rearranged
For KMT2A-rearranged, post-induction
treatment will be based on Interfant intensive
chemotherapy. The Interfant intensive phases
are a multi-drug treatment. After these
intensive phases, maintenance chemotherapy
or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) may be
considered.

Interfant induction
Interfant induction is the first phase of
treatment for infants. “Interfant” refers to the
name of the clinical trials that showed that
this was an effective and safe way to treat
infant ALL. You do not have to be enrolled
in a clinical trial to have Interfant induction.
However, enrolling in a clinical trial may be the
best choice for your child.

Not KMT2A-rearranged
Post-induction treatment options include:

There are 2 treatment options:

Interfant induction



Interfant induction is a multi-drug therapy that
might include prednisone, dexamethasone,
vincristine, cytarabine, daunorubicin,
pegaspargase, or methotrexate. Blinatumomab
might be added. Other systemic therapies
might be used. All regimens include central
nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with
systemic therapy and/or intrathecal (IT)
therapy. Systemic therapy works throughout
the body. IT therapy is injected into the spinal
fluid.

Standard of care chemotherapy using
non-infant ALL regimens
Standard of care using Interfant
chemotherapy

Maintenance
Maintenance chemotherapy is given to prevent
the return or spread of ALL. It is usually a
continuation of treatment, but might be at a
lower dose.

Surveillance
During maintenance therapy or after an
HCT, your child will be monitored for signs of
recurrence called relapse. If cancer returns,
treatment can be found under B-ALL or T-ALL
first relapse. For surveillance and monitoring
tests, see Guide 3.

Post-induction
The goal of post-induction treatment is to
rid the body of any remaining leukemia
cells. Treatment is based on the status of
a gene called KMT2A (11q23). If KMT2A is

Things you can do to prepare:

In shared decision-making, you and your
child's care team share information, discuss
the options, and agree on a treatment plan. It
starts with an open and honest conversation
between you and your child's care team.



Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you and your child may not be
important to someone else.

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, check out the websites listed in this
book.
