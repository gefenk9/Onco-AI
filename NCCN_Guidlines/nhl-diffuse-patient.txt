About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for B-Cell Lymphomas Version 1.2024 – January 18, 2024.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) is the most common type

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) begins in the
lymphatic system. The lymphatic or lymph
system is a major part of the body’s immune
system. It is a germ-fighting network of tissues
and organs that includes the bone marrow,
spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and lymphatic
vessels.

1 Lymphoma basics » Lymphocytes » DLBCL

As lymph travels throughout your body, it
passes through hundreds of small beanshaped structures called lymph nodes. Lymph
nodes make immune cells that help the body
fight infection. They also filter the lymph fluid
and remove foreign material such as bacteria
and cancer cells.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can develop from
B-cell, T-cell, or NK-cell lymphocytes. Diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) starts in B
cells. B cells mature into plasma cells, which
produce antibodies that are used to attack
invading bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The
antibody molecules latch onto and destroy
invading viruses or bacteria by recruiting other
components of the immune system. Cancers
of plasma cells are multiple myeloma and not
lymphoma.

Lymphocytes
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer
of lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type of
white blood cell that helps fight and prevent
infection. Lymphocytes are found in blood
and lymph tissue, and every organ in the
body. Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels
and lymph nodes. Lymphocytes normally
grow in response to infection or inflammation.
When they grow on their own without proper
regulation, they can develop into lymphoma.

DLBCL
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the
most common type of NHL. It accounts for
about 3 out of every 10 NHLs. DLBCL tumors
consist of fast-growing, large B cells. They are
commonly found in lymph nodes, spleen, liver,
bone marrow, or other tissues and organs.
Symptoms can include fever, night sweats,
fatigue, and weight loss. These symptoms are
referred to as B symptoms. Not everyone has
the same symptoms and tumors can be found
anywhere in the body.

There are 3 main types of lymphocytes:






B lymphocytes or B cells make
antibodies. An antibody is a protein.
T lymphocytes or T cells help fight
infections, kill tumor cells, and control
immune responses.

LBCL subtypes
There are many subtypes of large B-cell
lymphoma (LBCL). Diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma DLBCL is one type. For types of
LBCL, see Guide 1.

Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor
cells or virus-infected cells.

2 Testing for DLBCL » Test results

Accurate testing is essential to



diagnose and treat diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This
chapter presents an overview of



possible tests you might receive
and what to expect.

Test results


Results from biopsy and imaging studies will
be used to determine your treatment plan.
Treatment will be based on these findings. It
is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions and keep copies of your
test results. Online patient portals are a great
way to access your test results. Please discuss
your results with your doctor or health care
team.



Keep these things in mind:








Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.
Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.
Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.
Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.
They are great partners in your care.
In your contact list, include information on
the exact type of cancer you have, as well
as any treatments you've received and
the date each treatment started.
Set up a MyChart or health record
account if it’s available, which will
help you track your appointments and
communicate with your care team.

2 Testing for DLBCL » Fertility (all genders)

Medical history



A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.



Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect
your fertility, the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might change your fertility. To preserve your
fertility, you may need to take action before
starting cancer treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options
before starting treatment.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is
not inherited from your biological parents.
However, some cancers and other diseases
can run in families. Your care team will ask
about the health history of family members
who are blood relatives. This information is
called a family history. Ask family members
on both sides of your family about their
health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific
type of cancer or where the cancer started, if it
is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic
testing.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t sure at the
moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists
can help you sort through what may be best for
your situation.
More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Physical exam
During a physical exam, your doctor may:
Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat

2 Testing for DLBCL » Preventing pregnancy during treatment

Changes in fertility

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
period may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended during and after treatment.
Consult your doctor for the best time to plan a
pregnancy.

Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

Those with testicles

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment

Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth
control) such as condoms to prevent
pregnancy during and immediately after cancer
treatment.

Cancer and cancer treatment can affect the
ovaries and damage sperm. If you become
pregnant during chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or other types of systemic therapy,
serious birth defects can occur. Speak with
your care team about preventing pregnancy
while being treated for cancer. Hormonal birth
control may or may not be recommended,
so ask your doctor about options such as
intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier
methods. Types of barrier methods include
condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the
contraceptive sponge.

Those with ovaries
Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing
baby if you are or become pregnant during
treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding at the time of your cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.

2 Testing for DLBCL » Performance status » Blood tests

Performance status

Blood tests

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be
rated using a PS scale called ECOG (Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group). PS is one
factor taken into consideration when choosing
a treatment plan. Your preferences about
treatment are always important.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein. Be
prepared to have many blood tests during
DLBCL treatment and recovery to check
treatment results, blood counts, and the health
of organs like your liver and kidneys.

The ECOG PS scores range from 0 to 5.

Complete blood count and
differential












PS 0 means the person is fully active.

A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your
blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a picture
of your overall health. A differential counts the
number of each type of WBC (neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and
basophils). It also checks if the counts are in
balance with each other.

PS 1 means the person is still able to
perform light to moderate activity, but with
some limitations.
PS 2 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed less than half of the day and
still able to care for self.
PS 3 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed more than half of the day.
PS 4 means the person is totally confined
to the bed or chair and completely
disabled.

Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures 14 different substances in your
blood. It is usually done on the plasma part
of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.

PS 5 means the person is not alive.

Good PS is usually PS 0 or PS 1.

Creatinine
Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles.
Every person generates a fixed amount of
creatinine every day based on how much
muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the
blood tells how well the kidneys are working.
Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys

aren’t working as well as they were when
someone had lower levels of creatinine.

Electrolytes
Electrolytes help move nutrients into cells
and help move waste out of cells. Electrolytes
are ions or particles with electrical charges
that help the nerves, muscles, heart, and
brain work as they should. Your body needs
electrolytes to function properly. Phosphate
(PO4) is important for strong bones and teeth.
Too much phosphate in your blood can be a
sign your kidneys aren’t working well.

Testing takes time. It might
take days or weeks for all test
results to come in.

detects these markers to tell which cells are
yours. In other words, all your cells have the
same set of HLAs. Each person’s set of HLAs
is called the HLA type or tissue type.

Hepatitis B and hepatitis C
Hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV)
are types of liver disease caused by a virus.
A hepatitis blood test will show if you had
hepatitis in the past or if you have it today.
Some cancer treatments can wake up (or
reactivate) the virus. If this happens, it can
cause harm to the liver.

HLA typing is a blood test that detects a
person’s HLA type. This test is done before
a donor (allogeneic) hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT). To find a donor match,
your proteins will be compared to the donor’s
proteins to see how many proteins are the
same. A very good match is needed for a
transplant to be a treatment option. Otherwise,
your body will reject the donor cells or the
donor cells will react against your body. Blood
or tissue samples from you and your blood
relatives will be tested first.

HIV
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
An HIV antibody test checks for HIV antibodies
in a sample of blood, urine, or saliva. It’s
important to let your doctor know if you have
ever been infected with HIV. Treatment for HIVpositive DLBCL is not covered in this book.

Lactate dehydrogenase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is a protein found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into blood. Fastgrowing cells also release LDH and cause
levels of this protein to be elevated in the
blood.

HLA typing
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a protein
found on the surface of most cells. It plays
an important role in your body’s immune
response. HLAs are unique to each person.
They mark your body’s cells. Your body

radiation therapy. Very high levels of uric acid
in the blood can damage the kidneys.

If planned treatment might affect pregnancy,
then those who can become pregnant will
be given a pregnancy test before treatment
begins.

Biopsy
A biopsy is the removal of tissue or fluid for
testing. It is an important part of an accurate
diagnosis of lymphoma. Your sample should
be reviewed by a pathologist who is an expert
in the diagnosis of lymphoma. The pathologist
will note the overall appearance and the size,
shape, and type of your cells. This review is
often referred to as histology, histopathology,
or hematopathology review. Tests will be done
on the biopsied cells. Ask questions about your
biopsy results and what they mean for your
treatment.

SPEP
Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)
examines specific proteins in the blood called
globulins, which may be increased in certain
conditions.

Uric acid
Uric acid is released by cells when DNA
breaks down. It is a normal waste product
that dissolves in your blood and is filtered
by the kidneys where it leaves the body as
urine. Too much uric acid in the body is called
hyperuricemia. With DLBCL, it can be caused
by a fast turnover of lymphoma cells. High uric
acid might be a side effect of chemotherapy or

Your preferences about
treatment are always
important. If you have any
religious or personal beliefs
about certain kinds of
treatment, share them with
your care team and make
your wishes known.

2 Testing for DLBCL » Biopsy

Lymph node biopsy

Types of possible biopsies include the
following:








A lymph node biopsy is recommended to
diagnose DLBCL. Lymph nodes are usually
too small to be seen or felt. Sometimes, lymph
nodes can feel swollen, enlarged, hard to the
touch, or don’t move when pushed (fixed or
immobile). A lymph node biopsy can be done
using a needle biopsy procedure or as a small
surgery to remove (excise) a lymph node.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and
core biopsy (CB) use needles of different
sizes to remove a sample of tissue or
fluid.
Incisional biopsy removes a small
amount of tissue through a cut in the skin
or body.

Bone marrow tests

Excisional biopsy removes the entire
tumor through a cut in the skin or body.

Bone marrow tests might be done in certain
cases.

Lymph node biopsy removes tissue
from a lymph node.

There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that
are often done at the same time:

A biopsy is usually done with other lab
methods to accurately diagnose the type of
DLBCL. Incisional or excisional biopsies are
often preferred for diagnosing DLBCL.
These other lab methods include:


Immunohistochemistry (IHC)



Flow cytometry



Bone marrow aspirate



Bone marrow biopsy

Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding
liquid and cells. An aspirate takes some of the
liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy
takes a piece of the sponge.

Biomarker testing to detect gene
rearrangements and karyotype or
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
for major translocations

For many, this is a painful procedure. Your
care team will try to make you as comfortable
as possible. The samples are usually taken
from the back of the hip bone (pelvis). You will
likely lie on your belly or side. For an aspirate,
a hollow needle will be pushed through your
skin and into the bone. Liquid bone marrow will
then be drawn into a syringe. For the biopsy,
a wider needle will be used to remove a small
piece of bone. You may feel bone pain at your
hip for a few days. Your skin may bruise.

In a gene rearrangement, there is either loss or
gain of chromosomal material. A translocation
refers to the transfer of genetic material from
one chromosome to another.

2 Testing for DLBCL » Immunophenotyping

Immunophenotyping

used to help support a diagnosis. However,
an accurate diagnosis requires a trained
pathologist to review the tissue for abnormal
cells seen under a microscope. More testing
may be needed to establish a subtype.

Immunophenotyping is a process that uses
antibodies to detect the presence or absence
of certain antigens. Antigens are proteins or
markers that can be found on the surface of
or inside all cells, including white blood cells.
Specific groupings of antigens are normal.
However, some specific patterns of antigens
called the immunophenotype are found
on abnormal cells including non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) and DLBCL.

DLBCL is divided into 2 broad categories:


Germinal center B-cell (GCB)



Non-GCB

Immunophenotyping is used to establish
diagnosis and GCB versus non-GCB origin.

Immunophenotyping can be done using
specialized techniques called flow cytometry or
immunohistochemistry. These techniques are
used to distinguish DLBCL from other types of
lymphoma. Immunophenotype can change as
cancer progresses.





DLBCL immunophenotype is usually positive
for proteins CD20 and CD45, and negative
for protein CD3. Immunophenotyping is

GCB is CD10+ or BCL6+ and IRF4/
MUM1-.
Non-GCB is CD10- and IRF4/MUM1+ or
BCL6- and IRF4/MUM1-.

Additional markers are used to establish
subtype. See Guide 3.

Guide 3
Tests to diagnose DLBCL

Needed

• Biopsy and hematopathology review
• IHC panel: CD20, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD21, CD45, BCL2, BCL6, Ki-67,
IRF4/MUM1, and MYC with or without cell surface marker analysis by
flow cytometry: kappa/ lambda, CD45, CD3, CD5, CD19, CD10, and
CD20
• Karyotype or FISH for MYC
• FISH for BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements if MYC positive

In some cases

• Additional IHC studies to determine DLBCL subtype: cyclin D1, kappa/
lambda, CD30, CD138, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), human
herpesvirus-8 (HHV8), and SOX11
• Epstein-Barr encoding region in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH)
• Karyotype or FISH for IRF4/MUM1 rearrangements

2 Testing for DLBCL » Biomarker and genetic tests

Biomarker and genetic tests

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry (FCM) is a laboratory method
used to detect, identify, and count specific
cells. Flow cytometry involves adding a
light-sensitive dye to cells. The dyed cells
are passed through a beam of light in a
machine. The machine measures the number
of cells, things like the size and shape of
the cells, and other unique features of cells.
Flow cytometry may be used on cells from
circulating (peripheral) blood, bone marrow,
or a biopsy. The most common use of flow
cytometry is in the identification of markers on
cells, particularly in the immune system (called
immunophenotyping).

Biomarker and genetic tests are used to learn
more about your type of DLBCL, to guide
treatment, and to determine the likely path
your cancer will take (prognosis). This genetic
testing is different from family history genetic
testing or genetic cancer risk testing. This
testing looks for changes only in the DLBCL
cells that have developed over time, and
not changes in the rest of your body’s cells.
Biomarker testing includes tests of genes or
their products (proteins) and identifies the
presence or absence of mutations and certain
proteins that might suggest the lymphoma
subtype. It is sometimes called molecular
testing, tumor profiling, gene expression
profiling, or genomic testing.

The following cell surface markers might be
tested using flow cytometry: kappa/lambda,
CD45, CD3, CD5, CD19, CD10, and CD20.

Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of
46 chromosomes. Each chromosome contains
thousands of genes. Genes are coded
instructions that determine what proteins
are made in your cells. A mutation is when
something goes wrong in the genetic code.
Proteins are written like this: BCL6. Genes
are written with italics like this: BCL6. When
a gene or protein is found (expressed), it is
shown with a plus sign (+) like this: CD10+.
When a gene or protein has not been found,
it is written with a negative sign (-) like this
CD10-.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to immune cells. The cells are
then studied using a microscope. IHC looks for
the immunophenotype of cells from a biopsy or
tissue sample.

DLBCL cells sometimes have changes in
genes and chromosomes that can be seen
under a microscope or found with other tests.

Mutations can also happen during treatment.
Mutation testing is used to look for these new
mutations. Some mutations lead to resistance
to certain targeted therapies. There are many
possible mutations.

CD45, IRF4/MUM1, Ki-67, MYC, and
others

Examples of genes in the DNA of cells:


Gene rearrangements

MYC, BCL2, and BCL6

In gene rearrangements, part of a gene has
broken off and attached to another gene,
creating a new gene. When one cell divides
many times, the entire group of cells is called
clonal or clonality. In clonal rearrangements,
the same gene rearrangements are found in a
group of cancer cells.

Beta-2-microglobulin tumor marker
test
Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) is a protein
that can be found in the blood, urine, or
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). B2M is a type of
tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances
made by cancer cells or by normal cells in
response to cancer in the body.



Epstein-Barr virus in situ
hybridization

MYC
The gene for MYC (proto-oncogene) is
found on chromosome 8. An MYC gene
rearrangement (MYC-R) is often found with a
BCL2 or BCL6 gene rearrangement.

Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) in situ
hybridization (EBER-ISH) is used to detect the
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in tissue samples.
EBV sometimes can be found in those with
DLBCL. This test can help determine the
subtype of DLBCL.

BCL2
The gene for BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) is
found on chromosome 18. The transfer of
the BCL2 gene to a different chromosome
causes the BCL2 protein to be made in larger
amounts, which may keep cancer cells from
dying.

DLBCL mutation testing
A sample of your blood or bone marrow will
be used to see if the DLBCL cancer cells have
any specific mutations. Some mutations can
be targeted with specific therapies. This is
separate from the genetic testing for mutations
that you may have inherited from your
biological parents.

BCL6
The gene for BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6) is
found on chromosome 3. BCL6 rearrangement
is the most frequent chromosomal abnormality
found in DLBCL.

Mutation testing includes tests of genes or
their products (proteins). Subtle new drugNCCN Guidelines for Patients®

2 Testing for DLBCL » Biomarker and genetic tests

Deletions
When part of a chromosome is missing, it is
called a deletion. For example, in del(7q) the
q part of chromosome 7 is missing (deleted).
Specific chromosomal deletions can be found
in some types of diffuse B-cell lymphomas
but can also be found in other types of blood
cancers and disorders.

Mutations
DLBCL cells can have changes in genes
and chromosomes. Mutation testing looks
for these changes or abnormalities that
are unique to DLBCL cells. Examples
of such changes are called deletion,
insertion, amplification, translocation
(rearrangement), and point mutation.

FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. Since
this test doesn’t need growing cells, it can be
performed on bone marrow or a blood sample.

FISH can find translocations that are too small
to be seen with other methods. A translocation
occurs when parts of two chromosomes switch
with one another. However, FISH can only
be used for known changes. It cannot detect

is used to detect MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 gene
rearrangements.

A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes.
Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
A karyotype will show extra, missing

of chromosomes. Since a karyotype requires
growing cells, a sample of bone marrow or
blood must be used.

Translocations
Translocation is a switching of parts between
two chromosomes. A translocation between
chromosomes 11 and 18 is written as t(11;18).
Specific translocations can help distinguish
between types of blood cancers and disorders.

Create a medical binder

PCR

A medical binder or notebook is a great way
to organize all of your records in one place.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions
of copies of your DNA or RNA (genetic
information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find
1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000
normal cells. These copies, called PCR
product, might be used for high-throughput
sequencing (HTS) or next-generation
sequencing (NGS). This is important when
testing for treatment response or remission.

3 Make copies of blood tests, imaging

results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

3 Choose a binder that meets your

needs. Consider a zipper pocket to include a pen, small calendar, and insurance cards.

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is
a technique that compares DNA samples from
normal tissue and tumor tissue. It is used to
detect abnormal chromosomes.

3 Use online patient portals to view your

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a
method used to determine a portion of a
person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene
has any mutations that might affect how the
gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more
detailed way than other methods and can find
mutations that other methods might miss.

2 Testing for DLBCL » Genetic cancer risk testing » Imaging tests

Genetic cancer risk testing

might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

Genetic cancer risk testing is done using blood
or saliva (spitting into a cup). The goal is to
look for gene mutations inherited from your
biological parents called germline mutations.
Some mutations can put you at risk for
more than one type of cancer. You can pass
these genes on to your children. Also, family
members might carry these mutations. Tell
your care team if there is a family history of
cancer.

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan uses
x-rays and computer technology to take pictures
of the inside of the body. It takes many x-rays
of the same body part from different angles. All
the images are combined to make one detailed
picture. A CT scan of your head, neck, chest
abdomen, and pelvis may be one of the tests
to look for cancer. In most cases, contrast will
be used.

Imaging tests

MRI scan

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body to look for cancer deposits. A
radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report
to your doctor. While these reports might be
available to you through your patient portal or
patient access system, please wait to discuss
these results with your care team.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It does not
use x-rays. Because of the very strong magnets
used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist
if you have any metal in your body. During the
test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath
for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects
the images. Contrast is often used.

Contrast material

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that help
enhance and improve the images of several
organs and structures in the body. It is used to
make the pictures clearer. The contrast is not
permanent and will leave your body in your
urine immediately after the test. The types of
contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI.

PET scan

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast

they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans. However, not all tumors will
appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright
spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain,
heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on
PET. Inflammation or infection can also show
up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

Lymphoma can travel to the fluid that
surrounds the spine or brain. This may cause
symptoms. To know if lymphoma cells are in
your spinal fluid, a sample must be taken and
tested to rule out a central nervous system
(CNS) disease.
A lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure that
removes spinal fluid. It is also called a spinal
tap. A lumbar puncture may also be used to
inject cancer drugs into spinal fluid. This is
called intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy. When
systemic therapy and IT therapy are given
together to prevent CNS disease, it is called
CNS prophylaxis.

Scrotal ultrasound
DLBCL can occasionally be found in the
testicles. A scrotal ultrasound uses sound
waves to make images of the scrotum. The
scrotum is the pouch of skin at the base of the

2 Testing for DLBCL » Heart tests

Heart tests

MUGA
A multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan is used
to evaluate the pumping function of your heart.
During the test, a small amount of radiotracer
is injected into a vein. A special camera,
called a gamma camera, will create computergenerated movie images of your beating heart.

Certain treatments can affect heart (cardiac)
function. Heart tests might be used to see
how well your heart works. These tests might
be used as a baseline and before giving
chemotherapy. You might be referred to a
heart specialist called a cardiologist.

MUGA scan might show low ejection fraction.
This is when the amount of blood pumping
from the left side of the heart is lower than
normal.

Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows
electrical changes in your heart. It reveals
information about your heart rate and rhythm.
Prolonged corrected QT interval (or QTc)
occurs when your heart muscle takes longer
than normal to recharge between beats. Often,
this electrical disturbance can be seen on
an ECG. Certain treatments for DLBCL can
cause prolonged QTc. If the QTc becomes
too prolonged, it can cause dangerous heart
rhythms.

Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram (or echo) uses sound
waves to make pictures. For this test, small
patches will be placed on your chest to track
your heartbeat. Next, a wand with gel on its
tip will be slid across part of your bare chest. A
picture of your beating heart will be seen on a
screen. The pictures will be recorded for future
viewing.

We want your

An echocardiogram is one way of measuring
ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood
pumped out of the left side of your heart every
time it beats. In low ejection fraction, the
amount of blood pumping from the left side of
the heart is lower than normal.

Treating cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a

backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will

of treatment and what to expect.
Not everyone will receive the same
treatment. Treatment options are
based on many factors. Together,
you and your care team will
choose a treatment plan that is
best for you.

Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout cancer treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it. Get to know
your care team and help them get to know you.

DLBCL is highly treatable and curable. The
goal of treatment is to achieve a complete
response (CR) or compete remission. For
many people with DLBCL, treatment is
usually a combination of chemotherapy and
immunotherapy called chemoimmunotherapy.
Radiation therapy might be added. Surgery
is not a routine part of treatment for DLBCL.
If surgery is needed, find a surgeon with
experience in DLBCL.

Treatment phases

Surveillance and monitoring
You will be monitored throughout treatment.
Surveillance watches for any changes in your
condition after completing treatment. You will
have tests during surveillance to check for
relapse.

The goal of treatment is remission. Here are
some terms you might hear used by your care
team.

Induction
Induction or first-line therapy is the first phase
of treatment. The goal of induction is complete
response (CR) or complete remission. After
induction, you will have tests to look for a
response (remission).

International Prognostic
Index
The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is a
scoring system to predict prognosis in those
with lymphoma. A prognosis is the likely course
your disease will take. IPI is based on age,
performance status (PS), the stage of the
cancer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) results,
and if cancer is found in more than one area
besides the lymph nodes.

Remission
There are different types of treatment
response. When there are no signs of cancer,
it is called a complete response (CR) or
complete remission. Remission can be shortterm (temporary) or long-lasting (permanent).
In partial response (PR), cancer is still present,
but it has reduced in size.

Systemic therapy

Relapse

Systemic therapy works throughout
the body. Types include chemotherapy,
chemoimmunotherapy, immunotherapy, and
targeted therapy. Systemic therapy might be
used alone or with other therapies. Goals of
systemic therapy may be curative or palliative
and should be discussed before starting
treatment.

When DLBCL returns after a period of
remission, it is called a relapse. The goal of
treatment is to achieve remission again. A
relapse is very serious. It is important to ask
about your prognosis.

Refractory
When DLBCL remains and does not respond
to treatment, it is called refractory or resistant
cancer. This cancer may be resistant at the
start of treatment or it may become resistant
during treatment. Refractory disease is very
serious. It is important to ask about your
prognosis.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

The choice of therapy takes into consideration
many factors, including age, other serious
health issues, and future treatment possibilities
like a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Your
preferences about treatment are important.
If you have any religious or personal beliefs
about certain kinds of treatment, now would be
the time to share them with your care team.

29

3 Treating DLBCL » Chemotherapy » Chemoimmunotherapy

Chemotherapy

A biosimilar or substitute might
be used in place of rituximab. A
biosimilar is an almost identical
version of a drug made by another
company. It is used in the exact
same way and at the same dose as
rituximab. Biosimilars for rituximab
include: Riabni, Hycela, Ruxience,
and Truxima.

Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. More than one
chemotherapy may be used to treat DLBCL.
When only one drug is used, it’s called a single
agent. A combination or multi-agent regimen is
the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs.
Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that
are infused into a vein or injected under the
skin with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs
may be given as a pill that is swallowed. The
final dose differs between people because it is
based on body weight and height. Intrathecal
(IT) chemotherapy is injected into spinal or
brain fluid.

Chemoimmunotherapy
Chemoimmunotherapy, also called
immunochemotherapy, includes
chemotherapy and immunotherapy drugs
(agents) to treat cancer. There are several
chemoimmunotherapy regimens used to treat
DLBCL.

In most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles
of treatment days followed by days of rest.
This allows the body to recover before the
next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending
on which chemotherapy is used. You will have
tests to see how the cancer is responding to
treatment. You might spend time in the hospital
during treatment.

Antibody drug conjugate

CD20-targeting monoclonal antibody
therapy
CD20-targeting mAbs (also called anti-CD20
mAbs) such as rituximab (Rituxan) and
obinutuzumab (Gazyva) work against the
CD20 protein found on the surface of B cells
and DLBCL. The drug attaches to the CD20
protein causing direct cell death. It also alerts
the immune system to the cancer. This triggers
normal immune cells to kill the cancer cells.

An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) delivers
cell-specific chemotherapy. It attaches to a
protein found on the outside of the cancer cell
and then enters the cell. Once inside the cell,
chemotherapy is released. Loncastuximab
tesirine-lpyl (Zynlonta) is an ADC that targets
the CD19 protein. Polatuzumab vedotin-piiq
targets the CD79b protein and brentuximab
vedotin targets the CD30 protein.

Bispecific monoclonal antibody therapy
Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) bind to 2
different proteins (CD20 and CD3) at the same
time. They treat cancer by engaging T cells.
Bispecifics such as epcoritamab-bysp (Epkinly)
and glofitamab-gxbm (Columvi) might be an
option after an HCT or CAR T-cell therapy.
Bispecifics can cause a side effect called
cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is drug therapy that increases
the activity of your immune system. By doing
so, it improves your body’s ability to find and
destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy can be
given alone or with other types of treatment.

CD19-targeting CAR T-cell therapy

Monoclonal antibody therapy

CAR T-cell therapy is made by removing T
cells from your body and then training your
own immune cells to fight the lymphoma
for you by adding a CAR (chimeric antigen
receptor) to the T cells. This programs the T
cells to find cancer cells. The programmed
T cells will be infused back into your body to
find and kill cancer cells. This treatment is
not for everyone. There can be severe and
sometimes life-threatening reactions to this
treatment.

Antibody therapy uses special proteins
normally produced by white blood cells
and infection-fighting cells to help the body
fight cancer, infection, or other diseases.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in cancer
treatment may kill cancer cells directly or help
the immune system recognize and then kill the
cancer cells. As with other treatments, there is
the potential for complications.
CD19-targeting monoclonal antibody
therapy
Tafasitamab-cxix (Monjuvi) is used to treat
DLBCL and high-grade B-cell lymphoma by
targeting the CD19 protein.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

CAR T-cell therapy is one way to target
the CD19 protein found on almost at B-cell
lymphomas, including DLBCL. CAR T-cell
therapy is only used in recurrent lymphoma
outside of clinical trials.

3 Treating DLBCL » Immune modulator » Targeted therapy

CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy options
for DLBCL include axicabtagene ciloleucel
(Yescarta), lisocabtagene melaleuca
(Breyanzi), and tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah).
More information on CAR T-cell therapy can be
found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

Immune modulator
An immunomodulator changes your immune
system so it can work more effectively.
Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is an example of an
immune modulator.

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy is drug therapy that focuses
on specific or unique features of cancer cells.
Targeted therapies seek out how cancer cells
grow, divide, and move in the body. These
drugs stop or inhibit the action of molecules
that help cancer cells grow and/or survive.



Alectinib (Alecensa) and lorlatinib
(Lorbrena) target the activity of the ALK
protein found in those with an ALK gene
mutation.
Ibrutinib (Imbruvica) is a Bruton tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (BTKi). It blocks the BTK
protein, which the lymphoma cancer relies
on for survival. Since the main signal for
DLBCL growth is blocked, the lymphoma
cells eventually die off.

3 Treating DLBCL » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

External beam radiation
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s) or areas of the body.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from photons, electrons, or protons,
and other sources to kill cancer cells and
shrink tumors. RT may be used as the main
treatment to cure cancer (curative treatment),
or as supportive care or palliative care to help
ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer.

Common types of EBRT that may be used to
treat your cancer include the following:


Radiation is typically delivered from outside
the body by a computerized device, which
can shape the treatment to closely fit the
location and size of the tumor. Treatment is
given in small daily doses, on workdays, with
weekends off.



You will see your radiation oncologist at least
weekly to review your progress and to help
with side effects, such as sunburn-like rash.
Ask your care team which radiation option(s)
are best for your situation, if RT will be
combined with chemotherapy, and what side
effects to expect. RT puts you at a small risk of
developing another cancer in the future.



A four-dimensional (4D) CT scan might be
used to plan RT. A 4D-CT records multiple
images over time. It allows playback of the
scan as a video, so that internal movement
can be tracked and observed.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

33

Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses
computer software and CT images to aim
beams that match the shape of the tumor.
Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape of
the tumor.
Involved-site radiation therapy
(ISRT) treats the cancer site or cancer
found in or near lymph nodes (nodal
disease).

transplant

system so your body won’t kill the transplanted
cells. Chemotherapy is used for conditioning.
After conditioning, you will receive a transfusion
of the healthy stem cells from a donor matched
to you. A transfusion is a slow injection of blood
products into a vein. This can take several
hours. The transplanted stem cells will travel
to your bone marrow and grow. New, healthy
blood cells will form. This is called engraftment.
It usually takes about 2 to 4 weeks. Until then,
you will have little or no immune defense. You
may need to stay in a very clean room at the
hospital or be given antibiotics to prevent or
treat infection. Transfusions are also possible.
A red blood cell transfusion is used to prevent
bleeding and to treat anemia (below normal red
blood cell count). A platelet transfusion is used
to treat a low platelet count or bleeding. While
waiting for the cells to engraft, you will likely
feel tired and weak.

A hematopoietic stem cell is an immature cell
that can develop into any type of blood cell. A
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) replaces
hematopoietic stem cells that have been
destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/
or radiation therapy as part of the transplant
process. You might hear it called a stem cell
transplant (SCT) or a bone marrow transplant
(BMT). This book will refer to it as HCT. HCTs
are performed in specialized centers.
There are 2 types of HCTs:



Autologous – stem cells come from you.
Allogeneic – stem cells come from a
donor who may or may not be related to
you.

The goal of the transplant is for the new
immune system to recognize the lymphoma as
foreign and destroy it.

Autologous transplant
An autologous transplant is also called HDT/
ASCR (high-dose therapy with autologous
stem cell rescue) or an autologous HCT. First,
your healthy stem cells will be removed. Then,
you will receive highly intensified treatment to
kill remaining lymphoma cells and your bone
marrow cells. Your healthy stem cells will be
returned to rescue your marrow.

Possible side effects
Every treatment has side effects. You will be
monitored for infections, decreases in your
blood counts that require blood transfusions,
disease relapse, and graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD). In GVHD, the donor cells attack your
normal, healthy tissue. There are treatments
for GVHD. Ask your care team about the
possible side effects or complications of HCT
and how this might affect your quality of life.

Allogeneic transplant
An allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(allogeneic HCT) uses healthy stem cells from
a donor. The donor may or may not be related
to you. Before an HCT, treatment is needed
to destroy bone marrow cells. This is called
conditioning and it creates room for the healthy
donor stem cells. It also weakens the immune

3 Treating DLBCL » Surgery » Clinical trials

Surgery

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. Surgery is not a
routine part of treatment for DLBCL. If surgery
is needed, seek the opinion of an experienced
surgeon. The surgeon should be an expert in
performing your type of surgery in those with
DLBCL. Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating your type of cancer.







Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).



Phase I trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase II trials study how well the drug
or approach works against a specific type
of cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or
approach against a standard treatment. If
the results are good, it may be approved
by the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, lab
tests, or general health. These requirements
ensure that participants are alike in specific
ways and that the trial is as safe as possible
for the participants.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,

friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Start the conversation

Finding a clinical trial

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
It depends on the study, your health insurance,
and the state in which you live. In general,
procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered
standard of care will be billed to you or
your insurance, whereas those considered
research are covered by the trial sponsor. Your
treatment team and the research team can help
determine if you are responsible for any costs.

3 Treating DLBCL » Supportive care

Supportive care

All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important to tell your
care team about all of your side
effects so they can be managed.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to prevent,
reduce, and relieve suffering, and to improve
quality of life. Supportive care might include
pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual
support, financial aid, or family counseling. Tell
your care team how you are feeling and about
any side effects so they can be managed.
Supportive care, best supportive care, and
palliative care often mean the same thing.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.
Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Side effects

Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicines that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Some potential side effects are described next.
They are not listed in order of importance.
Some side effects are very rare.

Blood clots
Cancer can cause blood clots to form. This can
block blood flow and oxygen in the body. Blood
clots can break loose and travel to other parts
of the body causing stroke or other problems.

Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may be
caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of
treatment. Let your care team know how you
are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of
doing the things you enjoy. Eating a balanced
diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage
therapy can help. You might be referred to a
nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue.

Cytokine release syndrome
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a
condition that may occur after treatment
with some types of immunotherapy, such
as monoclonal antibodies and CAR T cells.
It is caused by a large, rapid release of
cytokines from immune cells affected by the
immunotherapy. Signs and symptoms of
CRS include fever, muscle aches, nausea,
headache, rash, fast heartbeat, low blood
pressure, and trouble breathing.

Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you
how to manage diarrhea. It is important to
drink lots of fluids.

Hair loss

Infections

Chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia)
all over your body—not just on your scalp.
Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely
than others to cause hair loss. Dosage might
also affect the amount of hair loss. Most of
the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is
temporary. Hair often regrows 3 to 6 months
after treatment ends. Your hair may be a
different shade or texture.

Infections occur more frequently and are more
severe in those with a weakened immune
system. Drug treatment for DLBCL can weaken
the body’s natural defense against infections. If
not treated early, infections can be fatal.
Neutropenia, a low number of white blood
cells, can lead to frequent or severe infections.
When someone with neutropenia also
develops a fever, it is called febrile neutropenia
(FN). With FN, your risk of infection may be
higher than normal. This is because a low
number of white blood cells leads to a reduced
ability to fight infections. FN is a side effect of
some types of systemic therapy.

Hypersensitivity, allergy, and
anaphylaxis
Certain treatments can cause an unwanted
reaction. Hypersensitivity is an exaggerated
response by the immune system to a drug or
other substance. This can include hives, skin
welts, and trouble breathing. An allergy is an
immune reaction to a substance that normally
is harmless or would not cause an immune
response in most people. An allergic response
may cause harmful symptoms such as itching
or inflammation (swelling). Anaphylaxis or
anaphylactic shock is a severe and possible
life-threatening allergic reaction.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas, 2024

Loss of appetite
Sometimes side effects from cancer or its
treatment, and the stress of having cancer
might cause you to feel not hungry or sick to
your stomach (nauseated). You might have a
sore mouth or difficulty swallowing. Healthy
eating is important during treatment. It includes
eating a balanced diet, eating the right
amount of food, and drinking enough fluids. A
registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition
and food can help. Speak to your care team if
you have trouble eating or maintaining weight.

Low blood cell counts

Neurocognitive or
neuropsychological effects

Some cancer treatments can cause low blood
cell counts.






Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration and memory. Survivors are at risk
for neurotoxicity and might be recommended for
neuropsychological testing. Neuropsychology
looks at how the health of your brain affects
your thinking and behavior. Neuropsychological
testing can identify your limits and doctors can
create a plan to help with these limits.

Anemia is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to
your cells. You might tire easily if you are
anemic.
Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infection.

Neuropathy

Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment such as
chemotherapy. Most of the time, neuropathy
goes away after treatment.

Lymphedema
Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph
fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.
It may be caused when part of the lymph
system is damaged or blocked, such as
during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment, or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression devices, and
other means.

Neurotoxicity
Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration and memory. Seizures and
confusion can occur.

Organ issues
Treatment might cause your kidneys, liver, and
heart to not work as well as they should.

Nausea and vomiting

Pain

Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain.

NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

go?

Tumor lysis syndrome

3 Does the pain change at different times

Cancer treatment causes cell death. In tumor
lysis syndrome (TLS), waste released by
dead cells builds up in the body causing
kidney damage and severe blood electrolyte
disturbances. Changes in creatinine, lactic
acid, uric acid, phosphorus (Phos), potassium
(K), and calcium (Ca) levels can be a sign of
TLS. TLS is rare.

After completing all cycles of RCHOP, a PET
scan will be done. Radiation therapy might be
given before entering surveillance to treat any
bulky or bone disease sites. Surveillance is a
period of testing that begins after remission to
monitor for relapse or the return of cancer.








Surveillance includes physical exam,
health history, and blood tests every 3
to 6 months for 5 years. After 5 years,
testing will be done once a year or as
needed.



Surveillance imaging may used for
monitoring those without symptoms
(asymptomatic). It includes a chest/
abdomen/pelvis CT no more than every 6
months for 2 years. After 2 years, imaging
testing will be done as needed.

RCHOP is rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone.
Treatment for non-bulky stage 1 or 2
disease is 4 to 6 cycles of RCHOP.
Bulky disease in DLBCL refers to cancer
that is 7.5 cm or larger.
Treatment for stage 1 or 2 bulky disease
is 6 cycles of RCHOP.
For stages 3 and 4,
chemoimmunotherapy such as RCHOP
and Pola-R-CHP are the recommended
and preferred options. Other
chemotherapy regimens such as DAEPOCH-R might be used.
A type of radiation called ISRT might be
added to treatment. Involved-site radiation
therapy (ISRT) treats cancer found in a
small region or one area of your body.
Surveillance is a period of testing that
begins after remission to monitor for
relapse or the return of cancer.

Overview
ALK-positive large B-cell lymphoma (ALK+
LBCL) is caused by a mutation in the
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. ALK
tells your body how to make proteins that help
cells talk to each other. ALK+ LBCL expresses
the ALK protein but lacks CD20 (CD20-). The
ALK mutation makes this lymphoma difficult to

Overview

An expert hematopathologist review is
essential to confirm the diagnosis of PMBL.

In primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma
(PMBL), a tumor forms most often behind the
breastbone (sternum). This can cause a cough,
shortness of breath, or swelling of the head
and neck, due to the tumor pressing on the
windpipe and the large veins above the heart.

Mediastinum
Mediastinal lymphomas are
growths found in the area of
the chest that separates the
lungs called the mediastinum. In
primary mediastinal large B-cell

Mediastinal lymphomas are growths found
behind the breastbone (sternum) in the part of
the chest that separates the lungs and holds

best for you.

Overview

MGZL immunophenotype is usually CD45+,
PAX5+, BOB.1+, OCT-2+, CD15+, CD20+,
CD30+, CD79a+, CD10-, and ALK-. BCL6
might be found and EBV is usually negative.
An expert hematopathologist review
is essential to confirm the diagnosis of
mediastinal gray zone lymphoma.

Gray zone lymphomas have overlapping
features of non-Hodgkin primary mediastinal
B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and Hodgkin
lymphoma (HL). This means that the cells
are large but can vary in size and might look
similar to Hodgkin cells (Reed-Sternberg cells).
Reed-Sternberg cells are large, abnormal
lymphocytes that may contain more than one
nucleus.

Non-mediastinal gray zone
lymphomas
Non-mediastinal gray zone lymphomas
occur in older persons, have a higher rate of
bone marrow involvement, include disease
outside the lymph nodes (extranodal disease),
and have more advanced-stage disease
than mediastinal gray zone lymphomas.
However, those with cancer found outside
the mediastinum (extra-mediastinal disease)
should be diagnosed as having DLBCL, not
otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS).

There are 2 main types of gray zone
lymphomas:

For possible systemic therapy options, see

Since MGZL has features of both classical
Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) and non-Hodgkin
PMBL, treatment is a challenge. Currently,
there is no standard of care or agreement
on treatment. MGZL is usually treated with
chemotherapy. If the tumor cells are CD20+,
rituximab might be added to chemotherapy.
This is called chemoimmunotherapy. Involvedsite radiation therapy (ISRT) may be added in
those with localized disease.

Mediastinal gray zone lymphoma
(MGZL) is different than primary
mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma
(PMBL). Those with gray zone
lymphomas are best managed in
cancer centers with experience in
treating this type of lymphoma.

Gray zone lymphomas have overlapping
features of primary mediastinal B-cell
lymphoma (PMBL) and Hodgkin
lymphoma (HL).
There are 2 main types of gray zone
lymphomas: mediastinal gray zone
lymphomas and non-mediastinal gray
zone lymphomas.
Mediastinal lymphomas are growths
found behind the breastbone (sternum)
in the part of the chest that separates the
lungs and holds the heart.
An expert hematopathologist review
is essential to confirm the diagnosis of
MGZL.
MGZL is usually treated with
chemotherapy. Rituximab might be added
to chemotherapy if the tumor cells are
CD20+. Involved-site radiation therapy
(ISRT) may be added in those with
localized disease.

Overview

In primary cutaneous diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (PC-DLBCL), leg

Primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCLs) or skin
lymphomas are a rare group of non-Hodgkin
lymphomas (NHLs) that develop in the skin. At
the time of diagnosis, PCL is not found in any
other areas of the body. Skin lymphoma is not
a type of skin cancer. Skin cancer develops
from skin cells. PCL develops from abnormal
lymphocytes.

skin is involved, the skin cells
themselves are not cancerous.
Despite its name, PC-DLBCL, leg
type can be found anywhere on

Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (PC-DLBCL), leg type consists
of large, transformed B cells that typically
appear as red or bluish-red tumors on the skin.
Despite its name, the disease can involve
the torso, arms, legs, buttocks, or anywhere
on the body. PC-DLBCL, leg type can also
spread to areas other than the skin. An expert
hematopathologist review is essential to
confirm the diagnosis of primary cutaneous
DLBCL, leg type. A skin biopsy is done to
distinguish between PC-DLBCL, leg type and
other types of primary cutaneous lymphomas.

arm, lower arm and hand, abdomen and
genitals, upper leg, lower leg and feet, upper
back, and lower back and buttocks.

Treatment is based on the number of skin
lesions and their location. This is called
staging. Skin lesions/tumors (T) will be
measured by their depth, height, size, and
region of the body. Lesions are often measured
in centimeters (cm). Body regions are based
on regional lymph node drainage patterns.
Body regions include head/neck, chest, upper

Disease may be solitary, regional, generalized
skin only, or outside the skin (extracutaneous).
At the end of treatment, imaging tests are
needed to assess response.

Body regions are based on regional lymph node drainage patterns.

Solitary or regional disease

First treatment
First-line therapy is the first treatment
given. Skin-only disease is initially treated
with RCHOP. RCHOP is rituximab,
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
and prednisone. ISRT might be added to
treat the skin lesions. A clinical trial is also an
option.

A solitary lesion is one lesion (T1). Regional
lesions can be multiple lesions limited to one
body region or two adjoining regions (T2).
Disease area will be measured.
Options include:


RCHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone)
with local involved-site radiation therapy
(ISRT)



Local ISRT



Clinical trial

After a complete response, you will have
imaging tests and be monitored for relapse
with follow-up testing.
For a relapse, if not given before, you might be
treated with RCHOP or local radiation therapy
(ISRT). Other treatment options are based
on if relapse occurred less than 12 months
or more than 12 months since your initial
treatment ended. For more information, see
Chapter 5: Relapse and refractory disease.

After a complete response (CR), you will have
follow-up testing to monitor for relapse.
For a relapse, if not given before, you might
be treated with RCHOP or local involved-site
radiation therapy (ISRT).

If there was no response, a partial response,
or a relapse, then treatment will be:

Generalized skin-only
disease
Generalized skin-only disease covers a larger
area of the body than regional disease. There
are multiple lesions that involve 2 or more
body regions (T3) not next to one another.
Disease is not found in lymph nodes, blood,
or other organs. Treatment works inside the
body to target the skin lesions. Involved-site
radiation therapy (ISRT) might be used to
target a specific area of skin.

and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects






Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, check out the websites listed in this
book.
