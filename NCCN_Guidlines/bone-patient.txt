About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Bone Cancer, Version 1.2025 – August 20, 2024.

bone cancer and differs from other
types of cancers that can spread
(metastasize) to the bone. This
chapter presents an overview of
bone cancer.

What is bone cancer?
Types of bone tumors

Cancers that start in the bone are called
primary bone cancers. Bone cancers that
start in another part of the body (such as the
breast, lungs, or kidney) and travel to the bones
are called secondary bone malignancies or
metastatic cancer. Metastatic cancers to bone
behave very differently from primary bone
cancers.

A bone tumor is an abnormal growth of cells
within a bone. A bone tumor may be cancerous
(malignant) or noncancerous (benign). Bone
tumors often occur in areas of the bone that
grow rapidly (the metaphysis).
This book will discuss the following:

Sarcomas



Most primary bone cancers are sarcomas.
Sarcomas are a rare group of cancers.
There are 2 main types of sarcomas:


Soft tissue sarcomas



Bone sarcomas



Soft tissue includes fat, muscles, nerves,
tendons, blood and lymph vessels, and
other supportive tissues of the body. Soft
tissue sarcomas are more common than
bone sarcomas. Bone sarcomas, such as
osteosarcomas, start in the cells that form

Chondrosarcoma – starts in the cells
that form cartilage. Cartilage is a tough,
flexible tissue that covers the ends of
bones to form a smooth surface that
makes a joint. Also, cartilage gives
structure to the nose, ears, larynx, and
other parts of the body.
Chordoma – starts in notochordal
cells that form the spine and vertebrae.
Chordomas are usually found in the lower
spinal column (sacrum) or at the base of
the skull.
Ewing sarcoma – starts in the bone
marrow and commonly occurs in the

diaphysis of long bones or flat bones like
the pelvis or scapula (shoulder blade).

Why you should
read this book

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) – is
an overgrowth of cells found in the part
of the bone called the metaphysis and
extends into the area of the bone that
widens to form a joint (epiphysis).

Making decisions about cancer care
can be stressful. You may need to make
tough decisions under pressure about
complex choices.

Osteosarcoma – starts in cells most
commonly in the areas of the bone that
grow rapidly (metaphysis), near the
growth plates.

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients
are trusted by patients and providers.
They clearly explain current care
recommendations made by respected
experts in the field. Recommendations
are based on the latest research and
practices at leading cancer centers.

What is bone?
Bone is a living tissue made up of specialized
bone cells and collagen. Collagen is the most
abundant protein in the body. Bone tissue
also contains blood vessels, nerves, proteins,
vitamins, and minerals.

Cancer care is not the same for
everyone. By following expert
recommendations for your situation,
you are more likely to improve your care
and have better outcomes as a result.
Use this book as your guide to find the
information you need to make important
decisions.

Bone is made up of the following:






Compact bone or cortical bone –
the hard, dense outer layer of bone that
is covered by a membrane of strong
connective tissue called the periosteum
Spongey bone or cancellous bone
– the spongy, porous inner layer of bone
that contains red marrow

Our body has 206 bones. Bones provide
structure and support, protect our organs,
create blood cells, store chemicals the body
needs, and produce hormones. Bone is light,
yet strong and can regrow.

Bone marrow – found in the center of
most bones and has many blood vessels

There are 2 types of bone marrow: red and
yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells
that can become red blood cells, white blood
cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made
mostly of fat. Red marrow is often replaced by
yellow marrow as we age.

What's in this book?

Chapter 10: Other resources provides
information on patient advocacy groups and
where to get help.

This book is organized into the following
chapters:

What can you do to get the
best care?

Chapter 2: Testing for bone cancer
provides an overview of tests you might
receive, how fertility might be impacted by
treatment, and the role of biomarker and tumor
mutation testing.

Advocate for yourself. You have an important
role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more
likely to get the care you want by asking
questions and making shared decisions with
your care team. Consider seeking the opinion
of a specialist in your type of bone cancer.

Chapter 3: Bone cancer staging explains
how bone cancer is staged and where bone
tumors might be found in the body.
Chapter 4: Types of treatment gives an
overview of the types of different treatment and
who might be on your treatment team.

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help
you understand cancer care. With better
understanding, you’ll be more prepared to
discuss your care with your team and share
your concerns. Many people feel more
satisfied when they play an active role in their
care.

Chapter 5: Chondrosarcoma discusses
chondrosarcoma treatment. Treatment is
usually surgery to remove the tumor.
Chapter 6: Chordoma discusses chordoma
treatment. Treatment options include surgery
or radiation therapy.

You may not know what to ask your care
team. That’s common. Each chapter in this
book ends with an important section called
Questions to ask. These suggested questions
will help you get more information on all
aspects of your care.

Chapter 7: Ewing sarcoma discusses
Ewing sarcoma treatment options. Treatment
begins with systemic therapy.

Take the next step and keep reading to learn
what is the best care for you!

Chapter 8: Giant cell tumor of bone
discusses GCTB treatment options. GCTB
is usually not cancer, but needs aggressive
treatment to prevent bone damage.
Chapter 9: Osteosarcoma discusses
osteosarcoma treatment options.
Osteosarcoma is the more common type of
bone cancer. Treatment is a combination of
therapies.

Your care team will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members on both sides of
your family about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what
age they were diagnosed. It’s important to
know the specific type of cancer or where the
cancer started, if it is in multiple locations, and
if they had genetic testing.

needed to diagnose and treat
primary bone cancer. This chapter
presents an overview of possible
tests you might receive and what
to expect.

Bone cancer is very rare. Many health care
providers are not experts in diagnosing or
treating these tumors. Therefore, it is important
to find a doctor, treatment center, or hospital
that has experience in your type of bone
cancer. Use resources on page 61 of this book
to help you find an experienced doctor and
treatment center.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

2 Testing for bone cancer » Fertility (all genders) » Performance status

Fertility (all genders)

Preventing pregnancy during
treatment

Some types of treatment can affect your
fertility, the ability to have children. If you think
you want children in the future, ask your care
team how cancer and cancer treatment might
change your fertility. To preserve your fertility,
you may need to take action before starting
cancer treatment. Those who want to have
children in the future should be referred to a
fertility specialist to discuss the options before
starting treatment.

Preventing pregnancy during treatment is
important. Cancer and cancer treatment
can affect the ovaries and damage sperm.
Therefore, becoming pregnant or having one's
partner become pregnant during treatment
should be avoided. Hormonal birth control
may or may not be recommended, so ask
your doctor about options such as intrauterine
devices (IUDs) and barrier methods. Types of
barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms,
cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t sure at the
moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists
can help you sort through what may be best for
your situation.

Performance status
Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be
rated using a PS scale called the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score
or the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS).
PS is one factor taken into consideration when
choosing a treatment plan.

For more information on fertility preservation,
see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®:
Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer at NCCN.
org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

2 Testing for bone cancer » Blood tests » Imaging tests

Blood tests

Lactate dehydrogenase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into blood.
Fast-growing cells, such as tumor cells, also
release LDH.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into a vein in your
arm. Some blood tests are described next.

Pregnancy test

Alkaline phosphatase

Those who can become pregnant should
be given a pregnancy test before treatment
begins.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme
found in the blood. High levels of ALP can
be a sign of bone tumors, liver disorders, or
pregnancy. A bone scan might be performed if
you have high levels of ALP.

Imaging tests

Complete blood count

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body to look for cancer deposits. A
medical doctor called a radiologist will interpret
the test and send a report to your doctor.
While these reports might be available to you
through your patient portal or patient access
system, please wait to discuss these results
with your care team. You may not have all of
the following tests.

A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your blood.
RBCs carry oxygen throughout your body,
WBCs fight infection, and PLTs control bleeding.

Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures substances in your blood. It
provides important information about how well
your kidneys and liver are working, among
other things. A CMP will look for higher than
normal calcium levels in your blood called
hypercalcemia. Calcium is needed for healthy
teeth, bones, and other body tissues. Bone
damage from cancer can cause your bones to
release calcium into the bloodstream, which
can lead to illness and other health issues.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bone Cancer, 2025

X-ray
An x-ray is a type of radiation. In small doses,
it is used to make pictures of the inside of the
body. It might be referred to as a radiograph.

Bone scan
A bone scan uses a radiotracer. A radiotracer
is a substance that releases small amounts of
radiation. Before the pictures are taken, the
tracer will be injected into your vein. It can take
a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones.

11

2 Testing for bone cancer » Imaging tests

MRI scan

A special camera will take pictures of the
tracer in your bones as it moves over your
body. Areas of bone damage take up more
radiotracer than healthy bone and show up
as bright spots on the pictures. Bone damage
can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment,
previous injuries, or other health problems
such as arthritis.

An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of the inside of the body. It
does not use x-rays, which means there is no
radiation delivered to your body during the
test. Because of the very strong magnets used
in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you
have any metal in your body. During the test,
you will likely be asked to hold your breath for
10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the
images. Contrast is often used.

The scan takes about 30 minutes. You will be
asked to hold still during the scan. At one point
the scanner will be less than one inch from
your face. Talk to your care team about what to
expect.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
quality of the pictures of the inside of the body.
Contrast materials are substances that help
enhance and improve the images of several
organs and structures in the body. It is used to
make the pictures clearer. The contrast is not
permanent and will leave your body in your
urine immediately after the test. The types of
contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI.

PET scan
A PET (positron emission tomography) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer
is a substance injected into a vein to see
where cancer cells are in the body and how
much sugar is being taken up by the cancer
cells. This gives an idea about how fast the
cancer cells are growing. Cancer cells show up
as bright spots on PET scans. However, not all
tumors will appear on a PET scan. Also, not all
bright spots found on the PET scan are cancer.
It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and
bladder to be bright on PET. Inflammation or
infection can also show up as a bright spot.
When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is
called a PET/CT scan.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

CT scan
A CT or CAT (computed tomography) scan uses
x-rays and computer technology to take pictures
of the inside of the body. It takes many x-rays
of the same body part from different angles. All
the images are combined to make one detailed
picture. In many cases, contrast will be used.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bone Cancer, 2025

An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made of
12

2 Testing for bone cancer » Biopsy » Genetic cancer risk testing

fluoride and a simple form of sugar called
glucose. You cannot eat or drink for at least
4 hours before the scan. This scan is most
helpful when other imaging results are unclear.

It is recommended that a
biopsy be performed by an
experienced surgeon at the
cancer center where you will
receive treatment.

Biopsy
A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue
from your body for testing. A diagnosis of bone
cancer is confirmed using a core needle or
surgical biopsy. The placement of the biopsy
is critical. Therefore, it is recommended that
the biopsy be performed by an experienced
surgeon at the center where you will receive
treatment.




Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding
liquid and cells. An aspirate takes some of the
liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy
takes a piece of the sponge.
The samples are usually taken from the back
of the hip bone (pelvis). You will likely lie on
your belly or side. Your doctors will first clean
and give sedation and/or numb your skin and
outer surface of your bone. For an aspirate,
a hollow needle will be pushed through your
skin and into the bone. Liquid bone marrow will
then be drawn into a syringe. For the biopsy,
a wider needle will be used to remove a core
sample. You may feel bone pain at your hip for
a few days. Your skin may bruise.

Core needle biopsy removes tissue
samples with a hollow needle that can
grab a piece of tissue. This is frequently
performed under light sedation by an
interventional radiologist. It can also be
performed by your surgeon in the office.
Surgical (open) biopsy removes a
sample of the tumor through a small
incision. A surgical biopsy should be
performed by your treating surgeon. This
requires a trip to the operating room.

Genetic cancer risk testing

Bone marrow tests

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
from spitting into a cup or a cheek swab. The
goal is to look for gene mutations inherited
from your birth parents called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You can
pass these genes on to your children. Also,
blood relatives might carry these mutations.
Tell your care team if there is a family history
of cancer.

Bone marrow tests might be done in certain
cases.
There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that
are often done at the same time:


2 Testing for bone cancer » Biomarker testing

Biomarker testing

everyone with Ewing sarcoma will have one of
the possible gene fusions. This is not inherited
from your birth parents but results from an
error of cell division while your tissues were
growing. This is called a somatic mutation or
somatic change.

A sample from your biopsy will undergo lab
tests to look for specific DNA mutations/
alterations, protein levels, or other molecular
features. Biomarker testing is performed on a
case-by-case basis and may increase the time
it takes for biopsy results. Biomarker testing is
sometimes called molecular testing or tumor
profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression
profiling, or genomic testing. Your care team
will recommend the best types of biomarker
testing that are important for you.

MSI-H/dMMR mutation
Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of
DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are
fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.
Some cancers have DNA mutations or
changes that prevent these errors from being
fixed. This is called microsatellite instability
(MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).
When cancer cells have more than a normal
number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H
(microsatellite instability-high). This is often due
to dMMR genes. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is
often used to treat MSI-H/dMMR tumors.

Biomarker testing includes tests of genes
or their products (proteins). It identifies the
presence or absence of mutations and certain
proteins that might suggest treatment. Proteins
are written like this: IDH1. Genes are written
with italics like this: IDH1. When a gene or
protein is found, it is shown with a plus sign
(+) like this: IDH1+. When a gene or protein
has not been found, it is written with a negative
sign (-) like this: IDH1-.

Tumor mutational burden
When there are 10 or more mutations per
million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H).
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), nivolumab
(Opdivo), or ipilimumab (Yervoy) might be
used for TMB-H tumors in some cases.

Ewing sarcoma
A cell must make a copy of its chromosomes
before dividing into two cells. Sometimes,
there are mistakes in the copies. One type
of mistake is when parts (DNA) of two
chromosomes break off and switch with each
other. This is called a translocation. It can
result in a fusion of two genes. A translocation
between chromosomes 11 and 22 is written as
t(11;22) and is common in Ewing sarcoma.

Tumor mutation testing
Tumor mutation testing or tumor genomic
aberration testing uses a sample of your tumor
or blood to see if the cancer cells have any
specific DNA mutations. This is a different type
of DNA testing than the genetic testing for
mutations you may have inherited from your
birth parents. In tumor mutation testing, only
the tumor is tested and not the rest of your
body.

Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the fusion
of the EWS gene (EWSR1) on chromosome
22 with various members of the ETS gene
family (FLI1, ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and FEV),
with FLI1 being the most common. Almost

2 Testing for bone cancer » Biomarker testing

PCR

Mutation testing uses methods such as nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) and polymerase
chain reaction (PCR).

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a
technique that can make millions or billions
of copies of your DNA or RNA (genetic
information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find
1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000
normal cells. These copies, called PCR
products, might be used for NGS.

IDH1 mutation
Some gene mutations such as IDH1 can
be targeted with specific therapies such as
ivosidenib (Tibsovo). Ivosidenib is for those
with chondrosarcoma who are prone to have
IDH1 mutations.

Next-generation sequencing
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a
method used to determine a portion of a
person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene
has any mutations that might affect how the
gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more
detailed way than other methods and can find
mutations that other methods might miss.

How is bone formed?

Cancer staging is used to help
make treatment decisions. It

Bone is a living tissue made of cells
(osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts),
calcium, phosphate, hydroxyapatite (a bone
mineral), and collagen. New bone formation,
known as ossification, starts in the womb and
ends during adolescence, between 10 and 19
years of age. Ossification is complete when
the skeleton is done growing.

describes the size and location
of the tumor, and if cancer has
spread to lymph nodes, organs,
or other parts of the body. This
chapter provides a general
overview of cancer staging.

Once ossification is complete, bone is
continuously being replaced by a process
called remodeling. Remodeling breaks down
and rebuilds bone and helps maintain normal
calcium levels in the body. When calcium
is needed, cells called osteoclasts break
down bone. This releases calcium into the
bloodstream. At the same time, bone-forming
cells called osteoblasts create bone from
calcium in the bloodstream. Some types of
bone cancer can interrupt this process.

Overview
There are many staging systems. Most staging
systems include information about:


Where the tumor is located in the body



The size of the tumor







Parts of bone:

Whether the cancer has spread to nearby
lymph nodes



Whether the cancer has spread to a
different part of the body



Tumor grade, which refers to how
abnormal the cancer cells look under a
microscope



Epiphysis – the end of the bone, which
is covered with cartilage to make a joint.
Metaphysis – located between the
physis (growth plate) and diaphysis.
Diaphysis – the middle region of the
bone.
Physis – the growth plate, which is made
of cartilage. After skeletal maturity, this
leaves a physeal scar or line visible in the
bone.

3 Bone cancer staging » TNM scores

TNM scores
The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system
is used to stage most bone cancers. In this
system, the letters T, N, and M describe
different areas of cancer growth. Based on
imaging and biopsy results, your doctor will
assign a score or number to each letter. The
higher the number, the larger the tumor or
the more the cancer has spread to lymph
nodes or other organs. These scores will be
combined to assign the cancer a stage. A
TNM example might look like this: T1N0M0
or T1, N0, M0. This might represent a stage 1
cancer.






The spine
The spinal or vertebral column includes a
flexible column of bones called vertebrae.
The spine includes the sacrum and tailbone
(coccyx). There are 24 bones in the flexible
spine: 7 cervical (neck), 12 thoracic (upper
back), and 5 lumbar (lower back).

T (tumor) – Size and depth of the main
(primary) tumor
N (node) – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes
M (metastasis) – If cancer has spread
(metastasized) to distant parts of the
body

Cancer staging is often done twice.




Clinical stage (c) is the rating given
before any treatment. It is based on a
physical exam, biopsy, and other tests.
Pathologic stage (p) or surgical
stage is determined by examining tissue
removed during surgery such as in the
removal of a lymph node. Pathologic
features include size, shape, and type of
cell.

T = Tumor



The primary (main) tumor size is measured in
centimeters (cm). A large pea is 1 cm. A golf
ball is 4 cm. A baseball is 7 cm. A grapefruit is
15 cm.



Tumors in limbs, torso, skull, and
face

Staging for tumors found in the pelvis are
described below.


TX – Primary tumor cannot be measured



T0 – Tumor cannot be found

Staging for tumors found in the appendicular
skeleton, torso, skull, and face are described
next.
TX – Primary tumor cannot be measured



T0 – Tumor cannot be found



T1 – Tumor is 8 cm or smaller



T2 – Tumor is larger than 8 cm



T4 – Tumor has grown into spinal canal
or large (great) vessels

Tumors in pelvis

Tumors are staged based on location. The
appendicular skeleton is composed of 126
bones of the upper limbs, the lower limbs,
the shoulder girdle, and the pelvic girdle. The
shoulder girdle is a set of bones that connects
the arm to the body. The pelvic girdle is a set
of bones that connects the leg to the body.



T3 – Tumor confined to 4 or more
adjacent vertebrae, or any nonadjacent
vertebrae



T3 – More than 1 tumor in the primary
bone site

Tumors in spine



Staging for tumors found in the bones of the
spine (vertebra) are described next.

T1 – Tumor is confined to 1 pelvic
segment and has not grown outside the
bone
•

T1a – Tumor is 8 cm or less

•

T1b – Tumor is larger than 8 cm

T2 – Tumor is confined to 1 pelvic
segment but has grown outside the
bone or 2 segments that have not grown
outside the bone

M = Metastasis

T4b – Tumor has grown into major
blood vessels

Bone cancer can spread through blood or the
lymphatic system. Cancer that has spread
to distant parts of the body is defined as M1.
When cancer is not metastatic it is labeled as
M0. Bone cancer can spread to the lung, other
bones, or other parts of the body. Bone cancer
that has metastasized to the lung is still called
bone cancer.

N = Node
There are hundreds of lymph nodes
throughout your body. They work as filters to
help fight infection and remove harmful things
from your body. Regional lymph nodes are
those located near the tumor. Cancer in the
lymph nodes is called nodal disease and is
rare in bone cancer.






NX – Cancer in nearby lymph nodes
cannot be measured.

M0 – No distant metastasis



M1 – Distant metastasis is found

The pelvis is a
basin-shaped
structure that
supports the spinal
column and protects
the abdominal
organs.

3 Bone cancer staging » Numbered stages

G = Grade

Guide 1
Bone cancer stages

Another factor used in staging is the cancer
grade. Grade describes how abnormal
the tumor cells look under a microscope
(histology). Higher-grade cancers tend to
grow and spread faster than lower-grade
cancers. GX means the grade can’t be
determined, followed by G1, G2, and G3. Well
differentiated (G1) means the cancer cells
look like normal cells. Poorly differentiated
(G3) means the cancer cells look very
different compared to normal cells.

Stage 1A

• T1, N0, M0, G1 or GX

Stage 1B

• T2 or T3, N0, M0, G1 or GX
• T3, N0, M0, G1 or GX

Stage 2A

• T1, N0, M0, G2 or G3

Stage 2B

• T2, N0, M0, G2 or G3



GX – Grade cannot be determined



G1 – Well differentiated (low grade)

Stage 3

• T3, N0, M0, G2 or G3

G2 – Moderately differentiated (high
grade)

Stage 4A

• Any T, N0, M1a, Any G

Stage 4B

• Any T, N1, Any M, Any G
• Any T, Any N, M1b, Any G





G3 – Poorly differentiated (high grade)

Numbered stages
Number stages range from stage 1 to stage
4, with 4 being the most advanced. The stage
of a bone cancer is determined by combining
the T, N, M, and G scores. These stages are
written as stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage
IV. Not all bone cancers are described using
numbered stages. See Guide 1.

4 Types of treatment » Care team

Treatment for bone cancer is



based on the type, size, and
location of the tumor. This chapter



presents a general overview of
different types of treatment and



what to expect.


Care team







Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout cancer treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it. Get to know
your care team and help them get to know you.



Your care team should include the following
core group:



An orthopedic oncologist or
orthopedic surgeon specializes in the
diagnosis and treatment of bone and soft
tissue tumors. They treat any area of the
body except the neck and skull and inside
the chest and abdomen.





NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bone Cancer, 2025

A radiation oncologist prescribes and
plans radiation therapy to treat cancer.
A musculoskeletal radiologist
interprets the results of x-rays and other
imaging tests.
A bone pathologist interprets the cells
and tissues removed during a biopsy or
surgery.

Depending on your type of care, the team
might include the following specialists:

Treating bone cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.



A medical or pediatric oncologist
treats cancer using systemic (drug)
therapy.

25

A thoracic surgeon performs
operations within the chest.
A plastic surgeon performs operations
to improve function or reconstruct missing
areas.
An interventional radiologist
performs needle biopsies, ablation
therapies, and embolizations, and places
ports for systemic therapy.
A physiatrist is a medical doctor who
specializes in physical movement and
rehabilitation.
A vascular surgeon specializes in
procedures involving arteries, veins, and
lymph circulation.
A surgical oncologist or general
surgeon has specialized knowledge
and experience related to the diagnosis
and preoperative, operative, and
postoperative care of the whole patient.
A neurosurgeon specializes in surgery
of the nervous system, especially the
brain and spinal cord.

4 Types of treatment » Surgery



The goal of surgery is to remove all of the
cancer. To fully remove all of the cancer, your
surgeon must cut out the tumor with a rim of
normal tissue around the edge. This allows
the pathologist to determine a surgical margin.
A clear or negative margin resection (R0) is
when no cancerous cells are found in the
tissue around the edge of the tumor. An R1
positive margin or R1 resection indicates the
surgeon has removed all of the visible tumor,
but the microscopic margins are still positive
for tumor cells. In an R2 positive margin, the
surgeon does not or is unable to remove all of
the visible tumor.

An orthopedic spine surgeon
specializes in the diagnosis and treatment
of spinal diseases and conditions. They
may be an orthopedic oncologist.

Other team members might include a physical
or occupational therapist, prosthetist, and
mental health expert.

Surgery
Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. The type of
surgery depends on the size, location, and
number of tumor(s), and should be considered
based on your lifestyle and needs.

A tumor that can be removed completely with
surgery is called resectable. Not all tumors
are resectable. You might receive treatment
to shrink a tumor or the amount of cancer
before surgery. This is called preoperative
or neoadjuvant treatment. Treatment after
surgery might be referred to as postoperative
or adjuvant treatment.

Surgery can be used to:




Remove the cancer at the primary (main)
site. Sometimes, surgery can be used
to remove limited areas of metastatic
disease.
Relieve pain or discomfort

"Don't let yourself stop
doing the things you enjoy
doing. Whatever your
hobbies are, whatever
things you like to do, keep
doing them. It'll help you
feel more like yourself
and stay positive during
what is an extremely
exhausting, mentally
straining time."

4 Types of treatment » Surgery

A surgeon who is an expert in your type of
bone cancer should be consulted before
deciding upon surgical treatment options. Not
all surgeons or cancer centers are experienced
in the types of surgery described below. The
type of surgery is based on many factors,
including your wishes and the best choice for
maintaining function or quality of life.

When preparing for surgery,
seek care or ask for a referral
to a hospital or cancer center
that has experience in treating
your type of bone cancer.
It is important to find an
experienced surgeon who
has performed this type of
procedure many times with
good results.

Limb-sparing surgery
For bone cancer in the limbs, the goal of
surgery, whenever possible, is to preserve
or maintain limb function. This is called limbsparing surgery (LSS) or limb salvage surgery.

Amputation

include occupational therapy to help with daily
life skills or physical therapy to help your body
move and function. A physiatrist is a medical
doctor who specializes in rehabilitation.

Amputation is surgery to remove part or all
of a limb such as an arm or leg. There are
different types of amputations. Some types
include reconstructive surgery, bone grafts, or
implanted pieces.

Seek a peer support group to connect with
others who have experienced the loss of a
limb. This will aid in your recovery and help
you to maintain an active lifestyle.

Rotationplasty
In a rotationplasty, the bottom of the thigh
bone (femur), the knee, and the top of the
shin bone (tibia) are removed. The lower leg
is then rotated and attached to the femur. The
ankle joint acts as a knee joint. The intention
of this surgery is to allow knee function when
it otherwise would not be possible. Not all
surgeons or cancer centers offer this type of
surgery.

Palliative surgery
Surgery to ease pain or discomfort is
called palliative surgery. It might be used to
remove metastases that are causing pain.
Surgery to remove a metastasis is called
a metastasectomy. This is different from a
mastectomy, which is surgery to remove
the breast. Palliative surgery is sometimes
offered to fix a broken bone or help prevent a
cancerous bone from breaking.

Rehabilitation after surgery
Rehabilitation, such as physical and
occupational therapy, will be part of any limbsparing surgery, amputation, rotationplasty,
or reconstructive surgery. Rehabilitation may

Systemic therapy

drug may be used to treat your type of cancer.
When only one drug is used, it’s called a single
agent. A combination or multi-agent regimen is
the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs.

Systemic (drug) therapy works throughout the
body. Types include chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy
might be used alone or with other therapies.
Goals of systemic therapy should be discussed
before starting treatment. Your wishes about
treatment are important. Make your wishes
known.








Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that
are infused into a vein or injected under the
skin with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs
may be given as a pill that is swallowed. The
final dose differs between people because it is
based on body weight and height. Intrathecal
(IT) chemotherapy is injected into spinal or
brain fluid.

Neoadjuvant or preoperative
therapy is systemic therapy or radiation
given before surgery.

In most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles
of treatment days followed by days of rest.
This allows the body to recover before the
next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending on
which chemotherapy is used. You might spend
time in the hospital during treatment.

Perioperative therapy is systemic
therapy given before and after surgery.
Adjuvant or postoperative therapy
is systemic therapy or radiation therapy
given after surgery.
Palliative therapy might be the term
used for systemic therapy given for
advanced or metastatic disease.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy is a form of systemic therapy
that focuses on specific or unique features
of cancer cells. Targeted therapies seek out
how cancer cells grow, divide, and move
in the body. These drugs stop the action of
molecules that help cancer cells grow and/or
survive. Some targeted therapy drugs block
the chemical signals that tell cancer cells to
grow. Other targeted therapy drugs block
signals that cause new blood vessels to form.
Others target hormones.

Systemic therapies are often described in the
following ways:






Preferred therapies have the most
evidence they work better than others.
Other recommended therapies
may not work quite as well as preferred
therapies, but they can still be useful.
Therapies used in certain cases are
for people with specific cancer features or
health circumstances.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is drug therapy that increases
the activity of your immune system. By doing
so, it improves your body’s ability to find and
destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy can be
given alone or with other types of treatment.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
normal cells. More than one chemotherapy

body and give one precise, large dose of
radiation.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from photons, electrons, or protons,
and other sources to kill cancer cells and
shrink tumors. It is given over a certain period
of time. Radiation therapy can be given alone
or with certain systemic therapies. When
used as supportive care to help ease pain
or discomfort caused by cancer, it is called
palliative RT.

Radiopharmaceuticals
Radiopharmaceuticals, such as radium-233
(Xofigo), contain a radioactive substance that
emits radiation. This radioactive substance
is different than contrast material used in
imaging.

Types of EBRT that may be used to treat your
cancer include:
Stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) uses high-energy
radiation beams to treat cancers in 5 or
fewer treatments.
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
uses special equipment to position the

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bone Cancer, 2025

Particle beam radiation therapy
uses protons, carbon ions, or other heavy
ions to treat bone cancer.

Internal radiation called brachytherapy is
placed inside the body as a solid implant
similar to beads or seeds.

After surgery, called adjuvant RT, to kill
any cancerous cells that remain

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s). There is more than one
type of EBRT used in the treatment of bone
cancer. These allow for safer, higher doses of
radiation.

Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape of
the tumor.

Other treatments
Ablation and embolization are described next.

Ablation
Ablation uses extreme cold or extreme heat
to destroy cancer cells. It can destroy small
tumors with little harm to nearby tissue.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions

There are 2 types of thermal ablation used to
destroy cancer cells:

You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.



Cryotherapy or cryosurgery



Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

Both types of ablation use a special needle,
called a probe, that is inserted into the tumor.
With cryotherapy, a medical gas is passed
through the probe to cause below-freezing
temperatures. This freezes the tumor to
destroy it. With RFA, the probe emits radio
waves to heat the tumor and destroy it. The
probe can be guided into place with a CT scan,
ultrasound, or other imaging tests. The probe
will be removed when treatment is done.



Turmeric



Ginkgo biloba



Green tea extract



St. John’s Wort



Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicines, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with systemic
therapy or supportive care medicines given
during systemic therapy. Therefore, it is
very important to tell your care team about
any medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter
(OTC) drugs, herbals, or supplements you
are taking.

Embolization
Embolization treats tumors by cutting off their
blood supply. To do this, a catheter is inserted
into an artery and guided to the tumor. Once
in place, beads are inserted to block the blood
flow. With chemoembolization, the beads are
coated with chemotherapy. Radioembolization
uses small radioactive beads.

Bring a list with you to every visit.

4 Types of treatment » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
It depends on the clinical trial’s rules, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. They ensure that participants
are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as
safe as possible for the participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in a
lab, potential new ways of treating cancer need
to be studied in people. If found to be safe and
effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or
treatment approach may be approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a research
team. This group of experts will review the
study with you in detail, including its purpose
and the risks and benefits of joining. All of this
information is also provided in an informed
consent form. Read the form carefully and
ask questions before signing it. Take time to
discuss it with people you trust. Keep in mind
that you can leave and seek treatment outside
of the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment
and are done in phases.








Phase 1 trials study the safety and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.

Are clinical trials free?

Phase 4 trials study the safety and
benefit of an FDA-approved treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bone Cancer, 2025

There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. But you may need
to pay for other services, like transportation or
childcare, due to extra appointments. During
the trial, you will continue to receive standard
cancer care. This care is often covered by
insurance.

4 Types of treatment » General supportive care

General supportive care

Late effects

Supportive care helps improve your quality
of life during and after cancer treatment. The
goal is to prevent or manage side effects and
symptoms, like pain and cancer-related fatigue.
It also addresses the mental, social, and
spiritual concerns faced by those with cancer.

Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social health
issues, and second cancers. The sooner late
effects are treated the better. Ask your care
team about what late effects could occur. This
will help you know what to look for.

Supportive care is available to everyone with
cancer and their families, not just those at the
end of life. Palliative care is another name for
supportive care.

Survivorship

Supportive care can also help with:


Making treatment decisions



Coordinating your care



Paying for care



A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

Planning for advanced care and end of
life

Side effects

A personalized survivorship care plan will
contain a summary of possible long-term
effects of treatment called late effects and list
follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care
provider will coordinate with specialists for your
follow-up care.

All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.
Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Locally aggressive tumors
This section is for treatment of atypical
cartilaginous tumors (ACTs), which are lowgrade intracompartmental tumors of the
appendicular skeleton. The appendicular
skeleton includes the shoulder girdle, the
upper limbs, the pelvic girdle, and the lower
limbs. These tumors have not grown through
the bone wall or spread to any other part of
the body. ACTs rarely metastasize and that is
why they are called locally aggressive tumors.
In some cases, ACTs can transform into a
malignant, more aggressive tumor. If this
happens, it will be treated as a cancer.

Low-grade extracompartmental
appendicular tumors have grown
outside the bone in the appendicular
skeleton.
Grade 1 axial tumors occur in the axial
skeleton, which includes the pelvis, ribs,
sternum, and scapula.

Depending on the location of the tumor,
treatment is intralesional excision (surgery)
to remove part of the tumor. This is also
called curettage. Intralesional excision is
not an option for pelvic tumors or tumors
determined to be malignant. Surgery to
remove all of the tumor (wide excision) might
be an option.







Treatment for metastatic chondrosarcoma is
based on the amount of observed metastatic
disease. If there are a few sites of metastasis,
this is termed oligometastatic. If there are
many sites, then this is called widespread
metastasis. Treatment focuses on reducing the
number of metastases or amount of cancer.

Physical exam
X-rays of primary site, and CT and MRI
scans as needed
Chest imaging every 3 to 6 months; this
may include chest CT at least every 6
months for 5 years, then every year for at
least 10 years

Oligometastases

Re-assess function at every follow-up visit

In oligometastases, there are a limited
number of metastases. If possible, you will
have surgery to remove all of the metastases.
Radiation therapy is an option for unresectable
metastases. A clinical trial using systemic
therapy is also an option.

Recurrence
Cancer that has returned after a diseasefree period is called a recurrence. When
a recurrence is suspected, a biopsy is
sometimes done to confirm diagnosis.

Widespread disease
Treatment options for widespread disease
might include:

If cancer returns at or near the same place,
then the treatment options are:






If resectable, surgery to remove all of the



If unresectable, radiation therapy might
be given.



Radiation therapy, surgery, and/or
ablation therapies for sites causing
symptoms
Systemic therapy such as dasatinib
(Sprycel) or pazopanib (Votrient)
Clinical trial

Before starting systemic therapy, biomarker
testing might be done. Not everyone with
metastatic chondrosarcoma is able to have
surgery or systemic therapy. For tumors with
IDH1 mutations, ivosidenib (Tibsovo) might
be an option. For MSI-H/dMMR tumors,
pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is the preferred
systemic therapy option. Preferred therapies
have the most evidence they work better than
others.

Overview

Treatment

Chordomas are a type of cancerous tumor that
can occur anywhere along the spine, from the
base of the skull to the tailbone. These tumors
grow slowly, gradually invading nearby bone
and soft tissue.

Chordomas are treated based on the location
of the tumor:




Tumors often involve critical structures
such as the brainstem, spinal cord, and
important nerves and arteries. For this reason,
chordomas are difficult to treat. They can also
come back, or recur, after treatment—usually
in the same place as the first tumor. This is
called a local recurrence. In about 2 out of
5 people, the tumor eventually spreads, or
metastasizes, to other parts of the body.

Tumors at or in the base of the skull

A tumor that can be removed with surgery
is called resectable. An unresectable tumor
cannot be removed with surgery and might
be treated with radiation therapy (RT).
Chordomas often grown outside the bone into
surrounding tissue near vital organs, veins,
and arteries. Parts of these tissues might also
need to be removed and sewn back together.
This is called resection. The goal is to remove
as much of the tumor as possible.

This chapter is for conventional or chondroid
chordomas. Those with chordoma should be
evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary
team who are experts in the management
of chordoma. Before starting treatment, you

When cancer returns, it is called a recurrence.
Treatment is based on if the recurrence is
local or metastatic. In local recurrence, cancer
returns close to where the initial (original)
tumor was found. In metastatic recurrence,
cancer is found in bones or other parts of the
body far from the original site.

For a resectable tumor, surgery (wide
excision) is the most important part of
treatment. RT might be given before,

RT is recommended. You will likely need more
rounds of systemic therapy after local control
treatment. The best treatment for you will be
based on the multidisciplinary cancer team
recommendations and your wishes.

When cancer does not respond or progresses
after primary treatment, then local control
therapy such as radiation therapy (RT) and/

7 Ewing sarcoma » Metastatic disease

Metastatic disease

Widely metastatic
Treatment for widely metastatic disease is
either systemic therapy with palliative surgery
or palliative radiation to treat areas causing pain
or discomfort. Other techniques might be used
to treat metastases. Biomarker testing might be
done before continuing systemic therapy.

Metastatic Ewing sarcoma is cancer that is
found in more than one location. It may be
cancer that has spread from the original or first
location to other parts of the body. Treatment
for metastatic disease at diagnosis is different
than treatment for cancer that has recurred
or progressed. Treatment of cancer that has
spread or metastasized is explained next.

Metastatic disease at diagnosis
Systemic therapy is the first or primary
treatment for all types of Ewing sarcoma
including metastatic disease as the first (initial)
diagnosis. Systemic therapy will include a
combination of chemotherapies called multiagent chemotherapy. Systemic therapy options
for an initial diagnosis of metastatic Ewing
sarcoma can be found in Guide 5.

Local control
Local control therapy focuses on the primary
(main) tumor. Options include surgery,
radiation therapy (RT), systemic therapy, or a
combination of these treatments. Metastasis
might be treated separately. Lungs, bone, and
bone marrow are the most common sites of
metastasis. Often, a lung metastasis is easier
to treat than a metastasis found in other sites.
Treatment for lung metastasis might include
surgery and/or RT.

Overview

Bone scan

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a rare,
aggressive, non-cancerous tumor. It generally
happens in adults between 20 and 40 years of
age, when skeletal bone growth is complete.
When viewed under a microscope, the tumor
consists of many very large cells or giant cells.
It is not known what causes a giant cell tumor.
GCTB usually develops near a joint at the end
of the bone. The knee is the most common
location, but it can be found in the bones of the
arms and the legs. It can also affect flat bones,
such as the breastbone or pelvis.

Biopsy to confirm diagnosis

GCTB has a strong tendency to return to the
same location. This is called local recurrence.
Although rare, it may also appear in the lungs
(metastasize).
When possible, treatment for a giant cell tumor
almost always involves surgery to remove the
tumor. Treatment aims to prevent damage to
the bone near the affected joint. Before starting
treatment, you will have a biopsy to confirm

In localized disease, the tumor is confined to
one area. Treatment is based on if the tumor
is resectable or unresectable as well as your
overall health.

Unresectable
An unresectable tumor cannot be removed
with surgery. This might be based on location
or other reasons such as you might have a
serious health condition that prevents surgery.

Resectable
A resectable tumor can be removed with
surgery. When possible, you will have surgery
to remove the tumor. Frequently, surgery
involves an intralesional excision or curettage
to save normal bone and scrape out all tumor
cells. Sometimes, a bigger surgery (wide
resection) is required to remove all bone
containing the tumor. This wide resection
type of surgery can require reconstruction of
the bone or joint. At the time of surgery, your

After treatment you will have imaging tests. If
tests find that the tumor is now resectable, you
will have surgery to remove the tumor. If the
tumor cannot be removed with surgery, you will
enter surveillance. Surveillance monitors for
any signs that cancer has returned.

Denosumab can affect your
teeth. Therefore, you should
see a dentist before starting
denosumab.

Monitoring

Metastatic disease

After completing treatment, you will be
monitored to watch for signs the tumor has
returned called recurrence. Monitoring includes
imaging tests of the surgical site. You will have
chest imaging to look for lung metastases.

Metastatic disease at diagnosis is different
than malignant transformation. GCTBs are
typically non-cancerous. However, in some
cases GCTB can transform into a malignant
(cancer), more aggressive tumor. If this
happens, it will be treated as osteosarcoma,
which can be found in the next chapter.

Recurrence

In metastatic disease, there is more than one
tumor. While GCTB is usually benign, it can
metastasize to the lungs or other bones.

GCTB often returns to the same area called
local recurrence. There is concern it can
spread (metastasize) to the lungs. You should
have chest imaging to see if there are any
metastases in the lungs. Treatment is based
on if it is a local or metastatic recurrence.

Local recurrence
Denosumab might be given before surgery
to remove a resectable primary tumor (wide

9 Osteosarcoma » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

Systemic therapies are often described in the
following ways:

Chemotherapy and other systemic therapies
are part of treatment for osteosarcoma. Firstline chemotherapies are those given first.
Second-line systemic therapy options are used
when disease progresses, does not respond to
first-line options, or relapses. See Guide 8





and Guide 9.



Preferred therapies have the most
evidence they work better than others.
Other recommended therapies
may not work quite as well as preferred
therapies, but they can still be useful.
Therapies used in certain cases are
for people with specific cancer features or
health circumstances.

Guide 8
First-line systemic therapy options
Preferred options

• Cisplatin and doxorubicin
• High-dose methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin (MAP)

Other recommended

• Doxorubicin, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and high-dose methotrexate

Guide 9
Second-line systemic therapy options
Preferred options

• Ifosfamide (high dose) with or without etoposide
• Regorafenib
• Sorafenib

Other recommended

• Cabozantinib
• Cyclophosphamide and topotecan
• Gemcitabine with or without docetaxel
• Sorafenib with everolimus

Used in some cases

• Cyclophosphamide and etoposide
• Ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide
• High-dose methotrexate
• High-dose methotrexate, etoposide, and ifosfamide
• Radium-223 for relapsed or refractory disease beyond second-line
therapy

9 Osteosarcoma » Low-grade and parosteal osteosarcoma » Metastatic disease at diagnosis

Low-grade and parosteal
osteosarcoma

the surgeon removes the bone containing
cancer and reconstructs the limb. Some
osteosarcomas require amputation. Rarely, the
tumor is unresectable. In this case, treatment
then involves radiation therapy or systemic
therapy.

This section is for intramedullary and surface
low-grade osteosarcoma. Treatment for lowgrade osteosarcoma is surgery to remove
the tumor called wide excision. Systemic
therapy might follow surgery if a high-grade
component is found unexpectedly in the
surgical specimen. Parosteal osteosarcoma
usually only requires surgery. Dedifferentiated
parosteal osteosarcomas are not considered
to be low-grade tumors.

Systemic therapy after surgery
Treatment after surgery is called adjuvant
treatment. When no cancer is found in the
surgical margin, it is called a negative margin.
Treatment is systemic therapy. When cancer
remains in the surgical margin, it is called a
positive margin. Treatment might be systemic
therapy, or more surgery. Radiation therapy
might follow surgery.

High-grade osteosarcoma
This section is for intramedullary and surface
high-grade osteosarcoma. Other types of
high-grade non-osteosarcoma such as
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) of
bone could also be treated the same way.

Metastatic disease at
diagnosis
This section is for those with metastatic
disease at diagnosis. Metastases can be found
in the lungs (pulmonary), bone (skeletal), or
internal organs (visceral). These are often
resectable. Surgery to remove a metastasis is
called a metastasectomy. This is different from
a mastectomy, which is surgery to remove the
breast. Some metastases might be treated
with systemic therapy, radiation therapy, or
other therapies. For example, unresectable
lung metastases might be treated with
ablation.

Systemic therapy before surgery
For most, treatment starts with preoperative
chemotherapy. The goal of chemotherapy is
to kill the cancer cells before surgery. After
chemotherapy, you will have imaging tests
to restage your cancer, assess treatment
response, and plan surgery. For preoperative
chemotherapy options, see Guide 8.

Surgery or local control therapy
Most osteosarcomas are treated with surgery
to remove all of the cancer cells in the
body. Imaging scans help determine if the
osteosarcoma can be removed with surgery.
Most osteosarcomas are resectable with
limb-sparing surgery (LSS). This means
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bone Cancer, 2025

If surgery is not possible, then treatment might
be systemic therapy or radiation therapy.
Before starting systemic therapy, biomarker
testing might be done.

57

9 Osteosarcoma » Periosteal osteosarcoma » Relapse

Periosteal osteosarcoma

Relapse

Periosteal osteosarcoma starts on the surface
of the bone called the periosteum. Treatment
is surgery to remove the tumor called wide
excision. Systemic therapy might be given
before surgery to reduce the size of tumor or
the amount of cancer.

If cancer returns, treatment is systemic therapy
and/or surgery. Surgery is not always possible.
Systemic therapy options can be found in

Guide 9.

After treatment for relapse, you will have
imaging tests. If your cancer has responded to
treatment, then you will be monitored for the
return of cancer (relapse) or for progression.

Monitoring
After completing treatment, you will be
monitored to watch for signs that cancer
has returned called recurrence or relapse.
Monitoring includes physical exam, blood
and imaging tests, functional movement
assessment, and regular visits with your
orthopedic surgeon and oncologist.

Treatment options for relapse and disease
progression include:

Standard of care is the best-known
way to treat a particular disease
based on past clinical trials. There
may be more than one treatment
regimen that is considered
standard of care. Ask your care
team what treatment options are
available and if a clinical trial might
be right for you.

Questions to ask

Osteosarcoma is the most common type
of bone cancer. It usually occurs around
the knee or shoulder.



Treatment most commonly involves
systemic therapy and surgery. Parosteal
osteosarcoma usually only requires
surgery.





Osteosarcoma can metastasize in the
lungs (pulmonary), bone (skeletal), or
internal organs (visceral). These are often
resectable.





Best supportive care is health care that
relieves symptoms caused by cancer or
its treatment and improves quality of life.
A metastasectomy is surgery to remove a
metastasis.
After completing treatment, you will be
monitored to watch for signs that cancer
has returned called recurrence or relapse.
This is called surveillance.
