About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Prostate Cancer, Version 4.2024 — May 17, 2024.

The prostate is a gland located

The prostate is about the size of a ping-pong
ball and is an important part of the male
reproductive system. Besides the prostate, the
male reproductive system includes the penis,
seminal vesicles, and testicles.

early-stage prostate cancer. This
chapter gives an overview of this
common cancer.

Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells.
Cancer cells develop genetic changes
(mutations) that allow them to multiply and
make many more cancer cells. The cancer
cells crowd out and overpower normal cells.
This can end up harming the body.

What is prostate cancer?
Prostate cancer is a disease where cells in the
prostate gland grow out of control.

Cancer cells survive much longer than normal
cells do. They can replace many normal cells
and cause organs to stop working well. Cancer
cells can also spread outside the prostate to
other areas of the body.

What are the symptoms of
prostate cancer?

Prostate cancer is the second
most common cancer in
American males, after
skin cancer.

A symptom is a feeling or problem that can
indicate a disease or condition. Prostate
cancer often grows slowly and shows no
symptoms for a long time.

However, prostate cancer has
one of the highest survival
rates of any cancer when
found early.

But you don’t have to have symptoms to have
prostate cancer. In fact, most patients who are
diagnosed with early prostate cancer have
no symptoms. Symptoms are more common
for those with advanced prostate cancer.
Symptoms, if they occur, can include:


Blood in the urine or semen



Burning or pain while urinating



Unexplained weight loss



Bone, hip, or back pain

BPH is much more common than prostate
cancer. It’s difficult to tell the difference
between the two conditions based on
symptoms alone. Be sure to tell your health
care providers if you have any of these
symptoms:

It’s important to know that prostate cancer has
many of the same symptoms as a condition
called enlarged prostate (also called benign
prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH). An enlarged
prostate can push against the bladder and
compress the urethra, which slows the flow of
urine and can cause a feeling that you haven’t
fully emptied your bladder.



Urinating frequently, especially at night



Weak or intermittent urine stream



Trouble urinating or straining to urinate



Trouble holding in urine

1 Prostate cancer basics » What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?

Where does the prostate fit in?
The prostate is located deep inside the lower body. It makes semen and is important for
sexual reproduction.
Prostate: A gland in the male reproductive system. A gland is an organ that makes
fluids or chemicals the body needs. The prostate gland makes a protein (prostate-specific
antigen, or PSA) that nourishes and helps transmit semen. The prostate also contains
muscles that help propel semen through the urethra during ejaculation.
Semen: A fluid made up of liquids from the prostate and the seminal vesicles as well as
sperm from the testicles. During ejaculation, semen is released from the body through the
urethra and out through the penis.
Urethra: A tube that carries urine from the bladder and out of the body. The prostate
wraps around the urethra just beneath the bladder.
Seminal vesicles: Two glands that make another part of the fluid that becomes semen.
The seminal vesicles are located above the prostate and behind the bladder.
Bladder: An organ that holds urine.

1 Prostate cancer basics » What causes prostate cancer?

What causes prostate
cancer?

Genetic factors
When cancer “runs in the family,” genetic
testing can be done to find specific genetic
changes (mutations) known to be linked with
prostate cancer or other cancers. For instance,
having an inherited genetic change in the
BRCA2 gene increases the risk of getting
prostate cancer. But genetic abnormalities that
aren’t inherited can occur, too.

Many people who develop prostate cancer
wonder where it came from and how they got
it. Cancer researchers don’t know exactly what
causes prostate cells to grow out of control
(become cancerous). The fact is, everyone
with a prostate has a risk of getting prostate
cancer.

Race

But several factors are linked to a higher risk of
prostate cancer. These are called risk factors.
A risk factor is anything that increases your
chance of getting cancer. Risk factors don’t
necessarily cause prostate cancer, but people
with prostate cancer usually have one or more
of these risk factors:

In the United States, Black males are more
likely than white males to develop prostate
cancer. Prostate cancer in Black males is also
more likely to occur at an earlier age and be
more aggressive and more advanced when
diagnosed. Black males are also twice as likely
to die from prostate cancer compared with
white males.

Age
The biggest risk factor for prostate cancer
is age. Prostate cancer is diagnosed most
often in those aged 65 years and above. Your
chances of getting prostate cancer increase as
you become older.

Prostate cancer is diagnosed less often in
Hispanic and Asian males than in white and
Black males.
Several things may contribute to these
differences, such as barriers to accessing
health care (including early detection
screening), biological and genetic factors, and
other causes. Specialists are researching each
of these areas.

Family history
Your family health history is information about
the diseases and health conditions in your
family. A family history reflects a pattern of
certain diseases among family members.
Having a close family member with prostate
cancer (a sibling or parent) increases the
chance of getting it yourself.

In light of these issues, Black males may want
to talk with their health care providers about
getting screening tests earlier than what’s
recommended for other males.

Those with a family history of certain other
cancers (breast, ovarian, colon, pancreatic,
and other cancers) may also be at a higher risk
for prostate cancer.

1 Prostate cancer basics » What is early-stage prostate cancer?

What is early-stage prostate
cancer?

What does aggressive
mean?

Prostate cancer can be grouped into earlystage cancer or advanced-stage cancer.

When health care professionals describe
cancer as aggressive, they mean the
cancer is likely to grow or spread more
rapidly than average.

Early stage
Early-stage prostate cancer has not spread
beyond the prostate. The cancer usually grows
slowly and stays in the prostate. Cancer that is
contained entirely within the prostate is called
localized prostate cancer.

Aggressive is also used to describe
therapy that’s stronger or more intense
than other treatment options.

This book is all about early-stage (localized)
prostate cancer.

Advanced stage
Diet and lifestyle

Advanced stage means that cancer cells have
spread outside the prostate to other areas in
the body. This spreading is called metastasis
or metastatic cancer. Metastatic prostate
cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, bones,
liver, lungs, and other organs.

No one particular diet has been found to
prevent prostate cancer or to cause prostate
cancer. However, eating food that’s high in
fat, such as meat and dairy products, has
been linked with an increased risk of prostate
cancer.

Advanced-stage prostate cancer can be
separated into two types:

Eating more fruits and vegetables may reduce
this risk. Exercise and losing weight may also
decrease the aggressiveness of prostate
cancer and the likelihood of dying from it. On
the other hand, smoking and obesity increase
the risks of developing and dying from prostate
cancer.

Cancer that grows from the prostate gland
to nearby lymph nodes, but no farther, is
called regional prostate cancer. (It’s also
called locally advanced prostate cancer.
This book will call it regional prostate
cancer to avoid confusion between
localized and locally advanced.)
Cancer that spreads outside the prostate
to other parts of the body is called
metastatic prostate cancer.

1 Prostate cancer basics » What is early-stage prostate cancer?

Early vs. advanced prostate cancer
Early-stage prostate cancer has not visibly spread beyond the prostate gland.
It usually grows slowly and stays within the prostate. This is also called localized
prostate cancer.

Advanced-stage prostate cancer has grown outside the prostate and may have
spread to other areas in the body such as lymph nodes (bottom left), bones, or organs
like the liver or lungs (bottom right). This is also called metastatic prostate cancer.

1 Prostate cancer basics » Can prostate cancer be cured?

Can prostate cancer be
cured?

Advanced-stage prostate cancer has
spread to other areas of the pelvis (regional
prostate cancer) or the body (metastatic
prostate cancer), and it's usually a life-long
disease. But treatment can slow down its
growth, reduce symptoms, and prolong your
life.

Early-stage prostate cancer is highly
treatable and often curable. The earlier that
prostate cancer is diagnosed and treated,
the more likely that a patient will live without
cancer. Most people with early-stage disease
live without cancer for many years, usually the
rest of their lives.

Treatments for advanced-stage prostate
cancer include hormone therapy,
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and
other therapies.

Scientists have learned a great deal about
prostate cancer in recent years. As a result,
today’s detection methods and treatments
work better than those in the past. Also, many
patients with prostate cancer have more
treatment choices now than they had before.

Early detection and treatment can greatly
reduce the chances of getting advanced-stage
prostate cancer. Many people with advancedstage prostate cancer continue to live their
lives with the cancer and, in the end, may die
from something else.

Treatments for early-stage prostate cancer
include surgery, radiation therapy, and
hormone therapy, among others. However,
some people with prostate cancer don’t need
to be treated right away. Many patients with
early-stage prostate cancer can have their
cancer managed with active surveillance.

Something to remember: When found early,
prostate cancer has one of the highest survival
rates of any cancer.

During active surveillance, you’ll have regular
tests to keep an eye on your cancer. But you
won’t have treatment unless the cancer grows
or changes in a way that requires treatment.
The goal of active surveillance is to avoid the
potential side effects of treatment, with the
option for treatment in the future if you need
it. Some patients on active surveillance may
never have to be treated.

Age is the biggest risk factor for prostate
cancer. As you age, your chances of
developing prostate cancer increase.
Everyone with a prostate is at risk for
prostate cancer. Not everyone with
prostate cancer has symptoms.
For most people, prostate cancer usually
grows slowly and stays within the
prostate.
Early-stage prostate cancer hasn’t spread
outside the prostate gland.
Advanced-stage prostate cancer has
spread outside the prostate to other
areas in the body. This spread is called

2 Tests for prostate cancer » Common prostate tests

Common prostate tests

If there’s something wrong with the prostate—
like prostate cancer—the prostate may make
more PSA. While most PSA goes into semen,
a little bit ends up in the bloodstream, too. An
unusually high amount of PSA in the blood
may be a sign of prostate cancer. Likewise, an
increase in PSA after treatment may indicate
that the treatment is losing effectiveness.

Common prostate cancer tests are used to
detect the possibility of prostate cancer in
someone who’s undiagnosed. They’re also
used to check and monitor prostate cancer in
patients who have been diagnosed.
Two common tests that look for prostate
cancer are the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
test and digital rectal exam.

However, age and other factors—such as an
enlarged prostate or a urinary tract infection—
can also cause high levels of PSA. This
means that a PSA test by itself can’t provide a
diagnosis of prostate cancer. That’s why a PSA
test is often paired with imaging or a digital
rectal exam, or both, to decide whether you
need a biopsy.

PSA test
This is a blood test that measures the amount
of PSA in your bloodstream. PSA is a protein
made inside the prostate gland. Its job is to
help semen transport sperm. All prostate cells,
both normal cells and cancer cells, make PSA.

PSA level (also called total PSA) is measured
in nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of
blood.

PSA testing
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is
a protein made inside the prostate
gland. If there’s something wrong
with the prostate, the prostate may
make more PSA. An unusually high
amount of PSA in the blood may be
a sign of prostate cancer.
But a high PSA level doesn’t
automatically mean you have
prostate cancer. Rather, it’s a
warning sign that you may need
further testing.

Digital rectal exam
Don’t be fooled by the name—no high-tech
electronics are used in a digital rectal exam.
For this test, the word “digital” means “finger.”
The doctor will insert a finger into your rectum
to feel your prostate for any signs of cancer.
The doctor will wear gloves and use a lubricant
to make it easier.

Don’t fear the
digital rectal exam
A digital rectal exam is the simplest and
most direct way to check the size and
texture of your prostate. Although it can
be uncomfortable, it’s over in less than a
minute.

A digital rectal exam (also called a prostate
exam) may be an awkward and unpleasant
form of testing. But it’s the simplest and most
direct way to check the size and texture of your
prostate. An irregular or hardened part of the
prostate could be a sign of a tumor.
Not all parts of the prostate can be felt during
a digital rectal exam, though. So it’s usually
paired with a PSA test and other factors—
your age, race, family history, and more—to
determine whether you need further testing.

2 Tests for prostate cancer » General health tests

General health tests

Symptoms and quality of life
Your doctor or another member of your care
team will ask you a series of questions about
what symptoms you may have (such as peeing
frequently, difficulty peeing or pooping, or
sexual problems). You’ll also be asked how
these symptoms affect your quality of life.

Health history
Your care team needs to have all your health
information. They’ll ask you about any health
problems and treatments you’ve had in your
life. Be prepared to talk about any illness or
injury you’ve had and when it happened. Also
tell your doctor about any symptoms you have.

Quality of life refers to your overall satisfaction
with your well-being and your ability to
participate in regular activities. It’s important
to answer all these questions honestly and
completely so your care team has a full and
up-to-date assessment of how you’re doing.

Bring a list of old and new medicines and
any over-the-counter medicines, herbals, or
supplements you take. Some of these (such
as saw palmetto or St. John’s wort) can cause
changes in your PSA level, so your doctor
needs to know if you’re taking them.

Blood and urine tests
For a blood test, a needle is inserted into
a vein in your arm to remove a sample of
blood. The sample is examined in a lab where
cells, proteins, and other components in the
blood are tested for signs of disease or other
conditions.

Family history
Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your care team will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history.

If you have a higher PSA level, you may have
additional blood or urine testing. These tests,
sometimes referred to as biomarker tests,
can be used in addition to PSA to help decide
whether further testing is needed. Such blood
tests include 4Kscore, PHI, and IsoPSA,
among others. Some of the urine tests include
ExoDx, miR Sentinel, MPS, PCA3, and
SelectMDx.

It’s important to ask members from both
sides of your family about all cancers, not just
prostate cancer. Ask family members about
other health issues like heart disease and
diabetes, at what age they were diagnosed,
and if anyone died from cancer. Share this
information and any changes to your family
history with your care team.

Diagnostic tests

expert in reading imaging tests. The radiologist
will send the results to your doctor. This
information helps your doctor plan the next
steps of your care. Your doctor will discuss the
results with you. Be sure to ask any questions
you may have.

If the PSA test, digital rectal exam, blood or
urine tests, or other factors (like family history,
race, or age) suggest you may have prostate
cancer, you’ll be offered diagnostic testing.
Talk with your doctor about whether a biopsy
or imaging should be the next test you take.

Imaging may not be needed for early-stage
prostate cancer. If your PSA, digital rectal
exam, and prostate biopsy results indicate that
your risk is low for the cancer to metastasize
(spread beyond the prostate), then you may
not need imaging tests at this time.

Imaging tests
An imaging test takes pictures (images) of the
insides of your body. The images can reveal
cancer, including its size, location, and other
features such as the size of the prostate itself.
The images may show where the cancer
started (primary tumor) and whether the
cancer has spread (metastasized). Imaging
is also used after cancer treatment to see
how well it worked and to check if the cancer
comes back.

Your team may recommend one or more of
the following imaging tests to look for cancer
growth:
MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. An
MRI can provide a detailed view of the cancer
within the prostate. It’s also used to see if
cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or
to the bones in your pelvis.

Imaging can come before, during, or after a
biopsy.






Before – Imaging is sometimes ordered
beforehand to find out if a biopsy is truly
necessary.

MRI may be used before a biopsy to target
areas suspicious for cancer. Or it may be used
after diagnosis to figure out whether the cancer
has advanced outside the prostate or into the
lymph nodes. It can help to plan treatment
or to decide whether active surveillance is
appropriate. MRI can also be used after
treatment to check if the cancer has come
back (recurrence).

During – Imaging is used during a biopsy
to guide the removal of tissue samples.
After – Imaging may come after a biopsy
to see the size and location of the cancer,
which helps to plan treatment.

Imaging methods for detecting prostate cancer
include MRI, CT, PET, ultrasound, bone scan,
or a combination of these.

An MRI scanner is a large machine with a
tunnel in the middle. An MRI machine makes
a lot of noise but you can wear headphones or
earplugs and listen to music.

After your scan, your images will be studied by
a radiologist. A radiologist is a doctor who’s an
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

2 Tests for prostate cancer » Diagnostic tests

You may also be given a contrast agent
(sometimes called contrast dye) before the
scan. Contrast is used to make blood vessels,
organs, and other tissues stand out more
clearly in the images. The contrast agent is
injected into the bloodstream and flushed out
in urine.

CT scan
If MRI is unavailable or not recommended for
you, you might have a computed tomography
(CT or CAT) scan instead. A CT scan takes
many x-rays of your body from different
angles. A computer combines all the x-ray
pictures to make a single detailed image.

An appointment for an MRI scan can take
about 1 to 2 hours, including 30 to 60 minutes
of actual scanning time. You’ll need to remain
as motionless as possible during each scan.
You may be positioned with pillows or bolsters
to help you keep still.

PET scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
highlights cells in your body that may be
cancerous. A PET scan is used after you’ve
been diagnosed to determine the extent of
your cancer or to see if it has metastasized.
PET imaging can also show how well
treatment is working.

Because an MRI uses magnets, don’t bring
any metal objects (such as jewelry, cell phone,
wristwatch, belts with metal buckles) into the
imaging room.

A PET scan requires injecting a radioactive
substance called a tracer into your bloodstream.
It takes about an hour for the tracer to circulate
throughout your body. The tracer targets your
cancer cells, which show up as bright spots on
the scan. Afterward, the radiotracer is passed
out of your body in your urine.

PET imaging
A positron emission tomography (PET)
scan highlights cells in your body that
may be cancerous. A PET scan is used
after you’ve been diagnosed to determine
the extent of your cancer or to see if it
has metastasized. PET imaging can also
show how well treatment is working. An
irregular or hardened part of the prostate
could be a sign of a tumor. Not all parts of
the prostate can be felt during this exam,
though. So other tests, like PSA level and
imaging, are used to get a more complete
picture of your prostate health.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

2 Tests for prostate cancer » Diagnostic tests

Like an MRI and CT, a PET scanner is a large
machine with a tunnel in the middle. A PET
appointment can take 1 to 2 hours, including
about 30 minutes of actual scanning time.

It’s also used to monitor prostate cancer that
may return after treatment (recurrence). So,
someone with early-stage prostate cancer
may not need PSMA/PET imaging when first
diagnosed. Your team will discuss whether
a PSMA/PET scan could be helpful for your
specific cancer.

Because PET uses a different imaging method,
it’s often combined with other types of imaging,
such as CT or MRI, to provide an even more
detailed image. These combined methods are
called PET/CT or PET/MRI scans.

Bone scan
A bone scan can detect whether cancer has
spread to your bones. A bone scan may be
used if you have bone pain, have a high risk
for bone metastases, or have changes in
certain test results. Bone scans may also be
used to monitor treatment.

PSMA/PET
PSMA/PET imaging is a special kind of PET
imaging that locates a protein called prostatespecific membrane antigen (PSMA) on the
surface of prostate cancer cells. Prostate
cancer cells make a lot of PSMA, so doctors
developed tracers that target this specific
protein.

A bone scan uses a radioactive tracer to make
pictures of the inside of bones. Before the
pictures are taken, the tracer is injected into
your bloodstream. It can take a few hours for
the tracer to enter your bones.

PSMA/PET is especially useful for detecting
cancer that has spread to nearby lymph
nodes or has metastasized to farther areas.

PET/CT scan of
prostate cancer
This image combines PET and CT
scans to show a cross-section of
a patient’s pelvis. The greenish
circle identifies cancer in the
prostate, while the intense red
dot indicates cancer that has
spread to a pelvic lymph node.

A special camera will take pictures of the tracer
in your bones. Areas of bone damage absorb
more tracer than healthy bone. These areas
show up as bright spots in the pictures. Bone
damage can be caused by cancer, cancer
treatment, or other health problems.

You and your doctors will decide when, or if,
you need a biopsy.
A biopsy procedure is usually performed by
a urologist. A urologist is a doctor who’s an
expert in treating diseases of the urinary
system and the male reproductive organs. For
this procedure, you’ll lie on your side with your
knees curled up or you’ll lie on your back with
your legs raised. You’ll be given anesthesia
to numb the pain or to put you to sleep. The
urologist will insert a lubricated probe into your
rectum. The probe provides a visual image of
the prostate.

Biopsy
Although a high PSA level and an abnormal
digital rectal exam are signs of possible
prostate cancer, the only way to confirm
cancer is to have a biopsy. A biopsy is a
procedure in which a sample of cells or tissue
is removed from your body and tested for
cancer.

The urologist will then insert a hollow needle
into the prostate gland using the video display
to guide it. The needle will be inserted either
through the rectum or through the perineum
(the skin between the anus and scrotum).
When the urologist removes the needle, it
will pull out a small sample of prostate tissue
called a core. A core sample is only 1 to 2

A biopsy is an invasive test, which means that
it goes into (invades) your body. All invasive
tests have some risk. The risks for a prostate
biopsy include infection, bleeding, and pain.
Doctors use invasive tests only when needed.

Biopsy of the prostate
A biopsy removes a sample of
tissue that is tested for cancer.
This is a transperineal biopsy,
in which a needle is inserted
through the perineum and into
the prostate. An ultrasound
probe, which goes into the
rectum, helps the doctor guide
the needle into the prostate. MRI
scans of your prostate may be
combined with the ultrasound
image to provide a highly
accurate picture of the cancer.

Genetic tests

millimiters wide and about 12 to 20 millimeters
long—about the width of a toothpick and the
length of a raisin. The urologist will typically
take 12 or more core samples from different
parts of the prostate. Checking different areas
provides a more complete evaluation of cancer
throughout the gland.

A genetic test is used to find abnormal
changes in your genes. Genes are small
segments of DNA inside every cell. Genes
provide the instructions to tell the cell how
to make proteins, which carry out a lot of
important functions in the body.

After the biopsy samples are removed, they’ll
be sent to a lab for testing. At the lab, a
specialist called a pathologist will examine the
samples under a microscope and test them for
cancer. The pathologist will find out how many
of the core samples contain cancer and will
also measure the percentage of cancer in each
core. With this information, the pathologist can
estimate the amount of cancer in the prostate.
Also, by knowing where each core sample was
taken, the pathologist can tell if the cancer
is concentrated in a certain section of the
prostate.

Once in a while, a gene will have or develop
an abnormal change (mutation). A mutation is
when something is different in your genes than
in most other people’s genes. Sometimes an
abnormal change can cause a gene to make
the wrong type of protein or make no protein at
all. This abnormality could affect the cell, which
may in turn cause a disease such as cancer.
Mutations can be passed down in families,
in which case they occur in every cell in your
body. Or mutations can occur spontaneously
in just some of your cells. In other words, they
may be present before you’re born (called an
inherited or germline mutation) or occur on
their own later in life (called an acquired or
somatic mutation).

The pathologist will put these results into a
report. Ask your doctor to review the pathology
report with you.
It’s common to have more than one biopsy
if you’re on active surveillance. You’ll have
one biopsy to determine your diagnosis
and another biopsy within a year (called a
confirmatory biopsy) to see if any changes
have happened over time.

The two basic types of genetic tests used for
prostate cancer care are germline testing and
molecular biomarker testing:
Germline testing
Sometimes, mutations in genes inherited from
your parents can increase the risk of different
cancers. You can pass these genes on to your
children. Other family members might also
carry these mutations. If you have a family
history of cancer, your doctor might suggest
genetic germline testing to find out if you have
an inherited cancer risk.

Having a biopsy may cause complications. A
complication is an unwanted and unplanned
result from a procedure. Complications may
include infection, bleeding from the rectum,
or blood in the urine, stool, or semen. These
usually go away after a few days or, with
semen, after a few weeks. However, it’s
important to know that a biopsy doesn’t cause
prostate cancer to spread or worsen.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

The goal of this type of genetic testing is to
look for germline (inherited) mutations that
22

2 Tests for prostate cancer » Diagnostic tests

occur in every cell in your body. Genetic
germline testing is done using a sample of
your blood, urine, or saliva.



For prostate cancer, germline testing looks
for characteristic changes in these genes:
BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2,
MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, and others. Some
mutations can put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. Germline mutations in
genes like BRCA1 or BRCA2 are also related
to breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic
cancer, and skin cancer (melanoma). Germline
mutations in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2
are related to colorectal and uterine cancers in
addition to prostate cancer.



Having any other type of cancer

The main reason to have a molecular
biomarker test is to help assess whether you
have lower risk or higher risk prostate cancer.
If you have lower risk cancer, you may be able
to avoid or delay treatment such as surgery
or radiation therapy, which means you’d
also avoid or delay any treatment-related
complications and side effects. At the same
time, a molecular biomarker test can flag those
who have higher risk prostate cancer, which
may give them a head start on treatment.

Molecular biomarker testing
In biomarker testing, a sample from your
biopsy is tested to look at its molecular
components. This information helps figure out
how likely your cancer could spread to other
parts of the body. Biomarker testing can be
considered for those with localized, regional, or
metastatic prostate cancer. Biomarker testing
is sometimes called genomic testing, tumor
profiling, or molecular tumor testing.

Germline testing is recommended for those
with prostate cancer and any of the following:



Talk to your medical providers and/or a genetic
counselor about your family history of cancer.

If a germline mutation is suspected based on
your family’s or your own health history, you
should ask about testing. Your doctor can talk
to you about testing or refer you to a genetic
counselor. A genetic counselor is an expert
who has special training in genetic diseases. A
genetic counselor can help you decide whether
you would like to undergo germline testing and
help you interpret the results of these tests.

It’s important to know the risk of

To assess risk, your care providers use these
tools: risk groups, life expectancy,
nomograms, and molecular biomarker
tests. Although you may not receive all of
them, let’s look at each of these assessment
tools in turn:

your cancer getting worse. Your
care team will look at several key
characteristics to assess your
risk. This chapter explains each of
these characteristics.

Risk groups
Your care team will look at the clinical
characteristics of your cancer, such as your
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, biopsy
results, and other test results. From this
information, your providers can classify your
disease into one of five different risk groups,
from very low risk to very high risk.

After being told you have cancer, your next
thought may be, “How soon can I start
treatment to get rid of it?” The fact is, a lot of
patients with early-stage prostate cancer don’t
need treatment right away. Many never need
treatment.
Figuring out whether someone needs
treatment and which treatment to use
requires an assessment of their risks. A
risk assessment is a process for identifying
potential problems and then considering what
would happen if those problems occurred.

Why do you need to know your risk group?
Because your risk group is the basis for your
prognosis. A prognosis predicts the likely
course and outcome of a disease. Your
prognosis guides your treatment options. For
example, patients with lower risk generally
get minimal treatment or no treatment at all.
Patients with higher risk usually get more
aggressive treatment.

In the case of early-stage prostate cancer,
a risk assessment considers how likely
the cancer is to remain within the prostate
or to spread to outside the prostate. A risk
assessment also considers whether the cancer
may come back after treatment (recurrence)
and, if so, whether it can be controlled with a
different type of treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

Test results and calculations—PSA level,
Grade Group, tumor stage, and biopsy
results —are put together to determine your
risk group.

26

3 Assessing your risk » Risk groups

“

PSA level
A simple blood test will tell you how much
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is in your
bloodstream. A high PSA level may indicate
a risk for prostate cancer. However, high PSA
levels can vary by age, race, and other factors:












Now more than ever, those living
with cancer are living better,
longer lives thanks to the power
of research and advancements in
treatment.”

Age – PSA level tends to increase with
age. For people in their 40s, a PSA level
above 2.5 ng/mL is very suspicious for
disease. For those in their 60s, 4.5 ng/mL
or higher is suspicious. A PSA level of 10
ng/mL or higher is a danger sign at any
age.
Race – Normal PSA levels tend
to be higher in Black males than in
white males—about 1 point higher on
average among males of the same age.
Researchers don’t know the reason for
this difference, but they’re investigating it.

PSA level doesn’t tell the whole story, though.
There are other ways that PSA can be
interpreted, such as PSA density.
PSA density
If you have a larger prostate, you’re also likely
to have a higher PSA level. But that doesn’t
mean you have a greater risk for prostate
cancer. To adjust for this, care providers
calculate PSA density.

Enlarged prostate – The larger the
prostate, the more PSA it can make.
Other health issues besides cancer can
also cause an enlarged prostate.
Sex and exercise – PSA may increase
after ejaculation or vigorous exercise.
Your doctor may recommend avoiding sex
and exercise for 2 or 3 days before a PSA
test. This short break allows PSA to return
to its usual level.

PSA density is the amount of PSA compared
to the size of the prostate. PSA density is
calculated by dividing the PSA level by the
prostate size. The size of the prostate is
measured by transrectal ultrasound or MRI
scan. A higher PSA density (above 0.15 ng/
mL², for example) indicates a greater likelihood
of cancer. PSA density also accounts for those
with small and very small prostates, who could
have prostate cancer even with low PSAs.

Drugs and supplements – Some
medicines, herbals, and supplements can
also affect PSA level.
Biopsy – PSA level rises temporarily
after a biopsy of the prostate.

Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

3 Assessing your risk » Risk groups

Grade Group

Gleason patterns range from 1 to 5. However,
patterns 1 and 2 are so rarely found that
they are no longer used. So the lowest (most
normal) pattern number is 3.

If cancer cells are found in your biopsy
samples, further testing can identify your
cancer risk. Results from these tests may
indicate that the cancer will grow and spread
quickly, for example. Or the results may
suggest that the cancer will grow very slowly
and not spread outside of the prostate at all.
This information helps plan the best treatment
for your type of cancer.

Gleason score
If prostate tumors contained only one pattern
of cancer cells, estimating risk would be much
easier. But prostate biopsies often contain
more than one pattern of cells.
To account for this, the two most common
Gleason patterns found in the biopsy sample
are combined into a single Gleason score. The
pattern of cancer cells that takes up the largest
area in the sample is assigned the first number.
The pattern that accounts for the secondlargest area is given the second number.

By looking at your biopsy samples, the
pathologist will identify certain cancer cell
patterns (called Gleason patterns), which
are used to calculate your Gleason score,
which translates to your Grade Group, which
estimates your risk.
Gleason patterns

Add these two numbers together and you get a
Gleason score. For example:


Gleason score



pattern 3 + pattern 4 =
Gleason score of 7

Grade Group



A Gleason score represents how much your
biopsy sample looks like normal prostate
tissue. It also estimates how aggressive your
prostate cancer is—how quickly it might grow
and whether it will spread. A higher Gleason
score means the cancer is more likely to grow
and spread quickly than a cancer with a lower
Gleason score.

Risk

This can be confusing at first (Gleason
patterns? Gleason score? Grade Group?) but
it’s not all that complicated in the end. Read on.
Gleason patterns
After studying your biopsy sample under
a microscope, the pathologist will assign a
number based on the “pattern” of cancer cells
(Gleason pattern) in the sample. A cancer cell
pattern that looks more like normal and healthy
cells is given a lower number. A cell pattern
that looks more abnormal is assigned a higher
number.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

Gleason scores range from 6 to 10, where 6
is the lowest score. A Gleason score of 7 is
intermediate-grade, and 8 to 10 is high-grade.
This can be confusing because 6 seems like it
would be a medium score, not a low score. So
to make Gleason scores simpler to use, they
can be organized into Grade Groups.

28

3 Assessing your risk » Risk groups

Grade Groups
A Grade Group is a way to interpret a Gleason
score. There are five Grade Groups, numbered
1 to 5. The higher the Grade Group, the
more aggressive the cancer. So cancer with
a Gleason score of 6 is assigned as Grade
Group 1 to show that it is the lowest score.
Likewise, cancer with a Gleason score of 9 or
10 becomes Grade Group 5, the highest score.

7. The difference is the cancer in Grade Group
3 is more serious. Why? Because the first
number of the Gleason score in Grade Group
3 (4+3) is higher than the first number in Grade
Group 2 (3+4). Remember, the first number is
given to the cancer pattern that makes up the
largest area of the biopsy sample.
Grade Group 1 indicates low risk. Grade
Groups 2 and 3 correspond to intermediate
risk. Grade Groups 4 and 5 predict high risk
and very high risk. See Guide 1.

Importantly, the Grade Group system also
takes into account that Grade Group 2 and
Grade Group 3 both have a Gleason score of

Prognosis
Low-grade cancer
is less aggressive and is likely to grow and spread
very slowly. If the cancer is small, many years may
pass before it becomes a problem. Low-grade cancer
may never need treatment.
Intermediate-grade cancer
is moderately aggressive and likely to grow and
spread at a modest pace. If the cancer is small,
several years may pass before it becomes a problem.
To prevent problems, treatment may be needed.

High-grade cancer
is very aggressive and likely to grow and spread
quickly. If the cancer is small, a few years may pass
before the cancer becomes a life-threatening problem.
To prevent problems, treatment is needed now.

29

3 Assessing your risk » Risk groups

Tumor stage

A letter may also be included after the
tumor stage (T2a, for example) to give more
information based on the digital rectal exam
or an examination of prostate tissue. The
letter stands for the extent of cancer and/or its
location in the prostate. See Guide 2.

The next characteristic that contributes to
your overall risk group is the tumor stage.
Staging is a way to describe the severity of the
cancer in your body and how far it has spread.
Knowing your stage is important for predicting
the course of your disease and for making a
treatment plan.

Cancer staging is often done twice. The first
time is before any treatment. The second time
is during or after treatment to see how well the
treatment has worked.

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage prostate cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M stand for different areas
of cancer growth:






Biopsy results
Results from your core needle biopsy also
help to determine your overall risk group.
One finding is the number of core samples
that contain cancer (for example, 5 out of
12 in each core). Using this information, the
pathologist can estimate the amount of cancer
in the entire prostate. Biopsy results can also
show whether the cancer is concentrated in a
certain section (or sections) of the prostate.

T (tumor) – Describes the size of the
main (primary) tumor and if it has grown
outside the prostate
N (node) – Identifies whether cancer has
spread to lymph nodes
M (metastasis) – Indicates if cancer
has spread to distant parts of the body
(metastasized)

What’s your risk group?
Based on the results of these tests and
calculations—PSA level, Grade Group, tumor
stage, and biopsy results—you’ll be placed into
an initial risk group. See Guide 3.

Your providers will assign a number to each
letter, based on test results. For example, the
number after T ranges from 0 through 4 based
on the tumor’s size and growth. The higher the
number, the larger the tumor or the more the
cancer has spread.

Your risk group helps determine which
treatment options may be best for you. Using
these tests together to create risk groups is
more reliable than using any test by itself to
choose treatment options.

The T, N, and M scores are combined to
assign a stage to the cancer.
Let’s say your prostate cancer is given a TNM
score of T2, N0, M0. This score means that
the tumor is big enough to be felt during a
digital rectal exam (T2). But the numbers after
N and M are zeros because early-stage cancer
hasn’t spread outside the prostate gland to
lymph nodes (N0) or to distant parts of the
body (M0).
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

But risk groups aren’t the only risk assessment
tool. There’s also life expectancy, nomograms,
and molecular biomarker tests.

30

3 Assessing your risk » Life expectancy

Life expectancy

means life expectancy can be applied to a
certain population or age range, but it’s not as
easy to make a precise estimate of the lifespan
of an individual person.

Life expectancy is the average lifespan of a
person. It’s measured in years. An estimate of
your life expectancy is a key factor in deciding
which tests and treatments you’ll need.

So why estimate your life expectancy?
Sometimes, patients in certain risk groups
should wait until symptoms appear before
having tests or starting treatment. There may
be no benefit to having additional tests or

It’s important to know that life expectancy—
when used for cancer care—is an estimate
based on large numbers of people. That

T3 – The tumor has spread outside the prostate to nearby tissues, but no farther.
T3a – Cancer has grown outside the prostate, but not into the seminal vesicle(s).
T3b – Cancer has grown outside the prostate and into the seminal vesicle(s).
T4 – The tumor has spread outside the prostate to nearby tissues and also to other areas
such as the bladder, rectum, pelvic wall, and/or pelvic muscles.

Molecular biomarker tests

undergoing treatment if you don’t have any
symptoms or if you have other more lifethreatening health conditions.

A biomarker is something found in your body
that can be measured to assess your health.
One type of cancer biomarker is a molecule
released by a tumor.

If you don’t have any symptoms, are expected
to live 10 years or less, and have very-low-risk,
low-risk, or intermediate-risk prostate cancer,
then observation is usually recommended.
This is different than active surveillance, which
usually involves routine imaging and biopsies.

Molecular biomarker tests use samples of your
blood or your prostate or lymph node tissue
removed during a biopsy. Results from these
and other tests may help choose a treatment
plan that’s right for you.

We’ll talk more about life expectancy and how
it impacts treatment options in Chapter 5.

Importantly, molecular biomarker tests can
help identify patients with lower risk prostate
cancer who don’t need treatment right away.
These patients can be spared aggressive
treatment along with its complications and side
effects.

Nomograms
A nomogram predicts your prognosis, which
is the likely course your cancer will take. A
nomogram uses math to compare you and
your prostate cancer to hundreds or thousands
of other patients who have been treated for
prostate cancer.

A molecular biomarker test is also known as
a molecular tumor test, genomic test, somatic
test, or tumor profiling. A few of the more
common molecular tests for prostate cancer
are named Decipher, Genomic Prostate Score,
and Prolaris.

To use a nomogram, your doctor will input
information about you and the characteristics
of your cancer—your age, PSA level, Gleason
score, or other details—and the nomogram will
calculate the likelihood of a certain outcome
(such as the cancer spreading).

If your doctor or genetic counselor
recommends molecular testing, it would be in
addition to standard measures such as PSA,
Gleason score, Grade Group, and imaging.
If you have any questions about why you’re
having a test or what it means, ask your care
team.

Risk groups and nomograms both provide
information that is specific to you, but
nomograms can give somewhat more accurate
estimates of cancer risk. Both are used, along
with other risk assessment tools, to plan
treatment.

A risk assessment identifies potential
problems and then considers what would
happen if those problems occurred.
A risk assessment for early-stage prostate
cancer takes into account your risk group,
life expectancy, nomogram results, and
possibly molecular biomarker profile.
Patients with lower risk generally get
minimal or no treatment. Patients with
higher risk usually get more aggressive
treatment.
Cancer staging describes how much
cancer is in the body and where it is
located.
Life expectancy is an estimate of the
number of years you will likely live. It’s
based on large numbers of people and
is not an exact prediction. But it can help
choose the best treatment for you.
A nomogram predicts the course your
cancer will likely take (prognosis).
An important feature of molecular tumor
(biomarker) testing is that it can identify
lower risk prostate cancer that doesn’t
need treatment right away.

your cancer grows or spreads.

best for you.

Why wait to be treated? Mainly because
surgery and other forms of treatment have
side effects. If you can delay treatment without
harm—or avoid it altogether—then you can
also delay or entirely avoid the side effects of
treatment.

Prostate cancer is usually a slow-growing
disease. It’s also a complex disease with many
treatment options. Common treatments for
early-stage prostate cancer include surgery
and radiation therapy, which are sometimes
combined with hormone therapy.

In general, active surveillance is the preferred
strategy for patients with lower-risk prostate
cancer and a longer life expectancy (10 years
or more).

Then again, your treatment plan may include
no direct therapy but instead involve active
surveillance or observation.

To see if you’re a good candidate for active
surveillance, you may need a confirmatory
MRI with or without a confirmatory prostate
biopsy. These confirmatory tests are usually
performed within a year of your diagnosis to
see if any changes have happened during that
time.

Active surveillance
Active surveillance is a plan that closely
watches your condition, with treatment at the
ready if needed.
Because a small tumor can grow very slowly,
it’s possible to wait to treat prostate cancer
until the tumor grows larger. During this time,
you’ll have tests and biopsies on a regular
basis to look for changes in tumor growth.

Other factors to consider for active
surveillance:

Although your care team may ask you to
have tests more or less frequently, regular
testing during active surveillance may follow a
schedule like this:

A big question about active surveillance: When
do you know to switch from surveillance to
treatment? There are a number of factors,
but the most common one is that a patient’s
Grade Group in a recent biopsy has increased
compared to a previous biopsy.

active surveillance involves frequent testing to
see whether the cancer is progressing in order
to treat it before it can get worse.

Surgery

Other reasons for starting treatment may
include an increase in the size of the tumor or
a rise in PSA level.

Surgery is a procedure to remove cancer from
the body. The tumor is removed along with
some normal-looking prostate tissue around its
edge called the surgical margin.

Observation



Observation involves monitoring your prostate
cancer and watching for symptoms. (You
may hear it called watch-and-wait or watchful
waiting.) If symptoms develop, treatment is
often focused on palliative care or symptom
relief instead of trying to cure the cancer.



A negative margin is when no cancer
cells are found around the edge of the
tissue that the surgeon removes.

A negative margin is the better result because
it means that all the tumor in that area has
likely been removed. On the other hand, a
positive margin doesn’t always mean that you’ll
have a recurrence.

Palliative care treats the symptoms of cancer
and the side effects of cancer treatment. This
allows patients to maintain a good quality
of life without the burden of unnecessary
treatment.

Surgery can be used as the main (primary)
treatment. Or surgery may be only one part of
your treatment plan. The type of surgery you
receive depends on the size and location of
the tumor. It also depends on whether cancer
is found in any surrounding organs or tissues.

Observation often applies to older or frail
patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer
and shorter life expectancies (5 to 10 years).
It’s also recommended for patients with lower
risk prostate cancer and short life expectancy
(5 years or less). These patients commonly
have one or more other illnesses or diseases
that are more severe than their prostate
cancer.

Radical prostatectomy
Prostatectomy means removing the prostate
gland through surgery. A radical prostatectomy
removes not only the entire prostate but also
the surrounding tissue, seminal vesicles, and
sometimes the nearby lymph nodes. So it can
be a highly effective way of curing prostate
cancer.

Observation is different from active
surveillance. Observation is a less aggressive
way to monitor prostate cancer. It doesn’t
require regular biopsies—just a visit for a
physical once or twice a year. By comparison,

A positive margin is when cancer cells
are found along the edge of the tissue
that the surgeon removes.

Shared decision-making
Some people with cancer want their doctors and treatment team to just tell them which
treatment to have. Doctors, nurses, and other providers are the experts, right? While it’s
true that your treatment team has lots of experience and knowledge, you’re also an expert—
you’re the expert on you.
It’s a good idea for your team to share the responsibility of your treatment with you. And it’s
a good idea for you to fully participate in making decisions about your care.
Here’s what your treatment team should share with you:
•

An explanation of the likely benefits and potential harms of each treatment option.

•

The likelihood of cure, recurrence, progression, and possible mortality with each
treatment option.

•

The side effects of each treatment option along with its impact on quality of life, including
sexual, urinary, and bowel function.

And here’s what you should share with your treatment team:
•

Your preferences and feelings about treatment, side effects, risks, and quality of life.
These should be key parts of your treatment plan.

If the provider who’s leading your treatment team doesn’t have a talk with you about shared
decision-making, feel free to speak up and ask about it.

Side effects of surgery

Radical prostatectomy is often used when:







Radical prostatectomy frequently causes two
side effects:

The tumor is found only in the prostate.
The tumor can be removed completely
with surgery.

Urinary incontinence. After a radical
prostatectomy, most people temporarily lose
the ability to control when they pee. This is
called urinary incontinence and it can be a
major problem.

You have a life expectancy of 10 years or
more.
You have no other serious health
conditions.

Right after the procedure, a catheter will be
inserted into your urethra to allow you to empty
your bladder and for your urethra to heal. The
catheter will stay in place for 1 to 2 weeks
after surgery. You’ll be shown how to care for
it while at home. If the catheter is removed too
early, you may lose control of your bladder or
be unable to urinate due to scar tissue.

A radical prostatectomy is complex and
requires a great deal of skill. Surgeons who
are experienced in this type of surgery often
have better results.
There are two surgical methods for radical
prostatectomy:




Open surgery removes the prostate
through a single cut or incision. The
incision is long enough to let your doctor
directly view and access the tumor to
remove it.

After the catheter is removed, you may need to
use absorbent pads or incontinence underwear
for several weeks or months. You can also
do exercises that strengthen the pelvic
floor muscle. (If you haven’t had prostate
surgery yet, consider starting pelvic floor
exercises beforehand to help to reduce urinary
incontinence afterward.) In addition, certain
prescription medications can reduce the need
to pee so often.

Minimally invasive surgery uses
several small incisions or holes instead of
one larger cut. The surgeon inserts small
tools through each incision to perform
the surgery. In most centers, the surgeon
uses a robot to guide the tools more
precisely.

Most patients gradually recover most of the
control of their bladder within a year, though
many continue to use pads for minor leaks. If
incontinence continues to be a major problem,
you can have a surgical procedure to control
urination.

Minimally invasive surgery has become more
common than open surgery. Patients who
receive minimally invasive surgery may have
shorter hospital stays, less blood loss, fewer
surgical complications, or faster recovery time.
The major side effects from minimally invasive
radical prostatectomy—incontinence and
erectile dysfunction—occur about as often as
they do with open surgery.

Erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction
means having difficulty or being unable to
have an erection of the penis. It’s a common
problem after prostate surgery, but it often—
although not always—improves over time.

prostatectomy, but damage to the nerves
during surgery is sometimes unavoidable.
Removing your prostate and seminal vesicles
will cause you to have dry orgasms. This
means there will be no semen, which would
prevent you from having children. You may
want to look into sperm banking before the
surgery if you’re thinking of having children.

There’s a higher risk for erectile dysfunction if:

You are older
You have erectile problems before
surgery

It may take several months to 2 years to
restore the erectile function you had before
the prostatectomy. However, you may never
regain the same erectile function or sex drive
you once had. Treatment options for erectile
dysfunction include pills (like Viagra and
Cialis), injections of medication into the penis,
vacuum constriction devices (“penis pump”),
and surgical implants that produce an erection.

Your cavernous nerves are damaged or
removed during surgery

The cavernous nerves control the ability to
have erections. These nerves run alongside
the prostate. Surgeons do their best to
avoid these nerves when performing a

Open vs. minimally invasive prostatectomy
A prostatectomy is an operation that removes the whole prostate. Open surgery removes
the prostate through a single cut or incision. Minimally invasive surgery uses several small
incisions or holes instead of one larger cut.

4 Prostate cancer treatments » Radiation therapy

EBRT

It’s also common to have psychological as
well as relationship problems with erectile
dysfunction. It’s a leading cause of depression
in patients with prostate cancer. This happens
often and is nothing to be ashamed of.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
uses a large machine outside the body that
aims radiation at cancer inside the body. The
radiation is focused directly on the cancer
(and on surrounding areas where the cancer
could spread), while trying to avoid healthy
tissue. This technique delivers higher doses of
radiation more safely than radiation therapy in
the past.

Ask your doctor or someone else on your care
team about therapy or counseling if you’re
having problems due to erectile dysfunction
or symptoms of depression. While it may be
uncomfortable to talk about these problems,
keep in mind that these side effects are
common and help is readily available.

You won’t become radioactive and you
can’t pass radiation to loved ones with this
treatment.

Radiation therapy

Two forms of EBRT are used for treating
prostate cancer. Photon radiation therapy
delivers high-energy x-rays to destroy cancer
cells and stop them from spreading. It’s
used in the majority of treatments because
it’s available at more centers. Proton
beam radiation therapy uses streams of
electrically charged particles called protons
to precisely target cancer cells. Both are very
good at treating prostate cancer and have
similar risks of side effects.

Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation,
like x-rays or gamma rays, to kill cancer cells
and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy is given
in regular doses over a certain period of time.
Radiation can be used instead of surgery to
treat cancer. Sometimes, radiation therapy is
given after surgery to help prevent your cancer
from coming back. Also, if your PSA begins to
rise after surgery, radiation therapy might be
recommended to try to kill any cancer cells that
could have been left behind. One advantage of
radiation therapy is that it’s less invasive than
surgery.

Both forms of EBRT require careful planning.
A week to several weeks before you start
therapy, you’ll have a radiation simulation. You
won’t receive any actual treatment during the
simulation. You’ll lie on the treatment table
and get into the best position for receiving the
radiation.

There are two main types of radiation
treatment for prostate cancer: radiation from
outside the body (external beam radiation
therapy) and radiation from inside the body
(brachytherapy).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

Because you’ll need to remain motionless
during the treatment, you may be fitted with
positioning devices to help you keep still.
You’ll also have imaging to map the location
of the tumor inside your body. This allows your
treatment team to calculate the right amount of
radiation delivered at the precise spot.
41

4 Prostate cancer treatments » Radiation therapy

During the treatment itself, the machine may
rotate around the treatment table to deliver
radiation from several different angles. You
won’t be able to feel the radiation when it’s
delivered. A treatment session may take up to
an hour, but the actual radiation time will take
only a few minutes. Treatments are usually
given every day for several days or weeks.

Brachytherapy may be used alone or
combined with EBRT, hormone therapy, or
both. Patients with high-risk cancers aren’t
usually considered for brachytherapy alone.
You might hear it called brachy (said “braykey”) for short.

Brachytherapy

High dose-rate brachytherapy involves a
procedure where 10 to 20 very narrow tubes
are inserted through the perineum and into
your prostate. Thin wires with radioactive tips
slide through the tubes and are held within the
prostate for several minutes. During this time,
the tips deliver a high dose of radiation to the
prostate. The wires are then retracted and the
needles are removed, leaving no radioactive
material behind.

Brachytherapy is an internal form of radiation
therapy. In this treatment, radiation is delivered
inside the body by placing a radioactive object
into or next to the tumor. This can be invasive
and is often done as a surgical procedure.

Low dose-rate brachytherapy is delivered
by dozens of tiny metal “seeds” that are
permanently implanted in your prostate. The
seeds gradually release a continuous low dose
of radiation over months.

Some treatments require specialized radiation
planning and delivery techniques. In certain
cases, stereotactic body radiation therapy
(SBRT) may be used. SBRT uses precise
image-guided targeting to deliver higher doses
of radiation in a fewer number of days.

External beam
radiation therapy
External beam radiation therapy
(EBRT) uses a machine that
precisely aims radiation at cancer
inside the body. The radiation
beam focuses on the cancer while
avoiding healthy tissue. This allows
for safer delivery of higher doses
of radiation, sometimes with fewer
treatments.

4 Prostate cancer treatments » Hormone therapy

Side effects of radiation therapy

Erectile dysfunction. Radiation therapy
can damage the nerves that control erections.
Erectile dysfunction doesn’t happen right away
after radiation. It usually occurs gradually,
starting and then worsening between 1 to 3
years after radiation treatment. (For more, see
“Erectile dysfunction” in the earlier section Side
effects of surgery, page 40.) Having hormone
therapy in addition to radiation therapy can
make this side effect more likely.

Side effects that occur during or after
treatment, called acute side effects, are more
common but often temporary. Side effects that
occur months to years later, called late side
effects, are less common.
Some of the common side effects of radiation
therapy are urinary and bowel problems,
erectile dysfunction, and fatigue.

Fatigue. Feeling very tired for a few weeks
to months after radiation treatment is also
common. However, regular physical activity
and exercise can help relieve fatigue.

Urinary and bowel problems. Urinary
problems include having to go more often,
having to go suddenly, a burning sensation
when you go, and sometimes blood in the
urine. Bowel problems can include diarrhea,
pooping frequently, being unable to hold it in
and, rarely, bleeding from the rectum. Urinary
and bowel problems usually lessen or go away
after several weeks for most people but can
last longer for others.

Hormone therapy
Hormone therapy is rarely used by itself for
the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.
When hormone therapy is used (generally for

Brachytherapy radiation
Low dose-rate brachytherapy

“seeds” that are implanted
into your prostate. Each
seed is about the size of a
grain of rice. They’ll stay in
your prostate permanently
and provide a low dose
of radiation continuously
for several months. This
treatment strategy spares
nearby healthy tissue from
unnecessary radiation.

patients with higher risk), it’s usually given with
radiation therapy, which increases radiation’s
effectiveness. Hormone therapy may be given
before, during, or after radiation therapy.

Hormone therapies for prostate cancer include
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
(LHRH) agonists and LHRH antagonists, both
of which cause the testicles to stop making
testosterone. Most LHRH agonists and LHRH
antagonists are injections. These may be
given monthly or 2, 3, or 4 times a year. Antiandrogens, corticosteroids, and androgen
synthesis inhibitors are available as pills and
taken 1 to 3 times a day, depending on the
medication. See Guide 4.

Hormone therapy is treatment that adds,
blocks, or removes hormones. A hormone is a
natural chemical made by a gland in the body.
Its job is to activate cells or organs.
Male hormones are called androgens. The
main androgen is testosterone. Most of the
testosterone in the body is made by the
testicles. Testosterone helps produce sperm,
among other functions. But testosterone
also helps prostate cancer grow. A type of
hormone therapy called androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT) can stop your body from making
testosterone or block cancer cells from using
testosterone. This can shrink the tumor or slow
tumor growth for a while.

Side effects of hormone therapy
Hormone therapy has significant side
effects. Many factors affect your risk for
side effects including your age, your health
before treatment, how long or often you have
treatment, and other things.
In general, the longer you’re on hormone
therapy, the greater your risk of thinning and
weakening of your bones (osteoporosis), bone
fractures, weight gain, loss of muscle mass,
diabetes, and heart disease. You may need an
x-ray scan (DEXA scan) to check your bone
density before starting hormone therapy.

You might hear the term “castration” used
when describing prostate cancer or its
treatment. This term describes a drastic
reduction of testosterone. Castration can be
a short-term reversible treatment using drugs
or it can be permanent surgical removal of
one or both testicles (orchiectomy). Though
orchiectomy is a surgical procedure, it’s still
considered hormone therapy because it
removes the primary source of testosterone:
the testicles. Unlike drug hormone therapy,
orchiectomy can’t be reversed.

Other side effects of hormone therapy include
tiredness (fatigue), mood changes, weight
gain, and growth and tenderness of your
breasts.
Hormone therapy increases the risk for
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. If you
already have either of these conditions,
hormone therapy can cause them to get
worse. Hormone therapy may increase the risk
of death from heart issues, particularly in Black
patients.

Surgical removal of the testicles is much less
common today because drug therapy is often
just as effective at blocking testosterone.
Orchiectomy is now used only for advanced
metastatic prostate cancer.

4 Prostate cancer treatments » Cryotherapy

In addition, the sexual side effects of hormone
therapy are a significant cause of stress.
Hormone therapy may lower your desire for
sex, cause erectile dysfunction, and reduce
the size of the penis and testicles. Erectile
dysfunction medicines (such as Viagra and
Cialis) aren’t usually effective for those on
hormone therapy, but other injected medicines
may be helpful. These drugs don’t restore
the loss of sexual desire caused by lower
androgen levels.

medicine as well as with physical activity.
Exercise and eating a healthy diet can also
help with fatigue, mood, and weight gain.

It may take a year or more to regain your
testosterone level and sex drive. Many
patients never fully regain the same levels of
testosterone and libido that they had before
hormone therapy.

Cryotherapy

Loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and
other sexual side effects usually go away after
you stop hormone therapy. In the meantime,
consider talking to your partner and/or a
therapist to help you deal with any problems
you’re having.

Cryotherapy, also known as cryosurgery or
cryoablation, destroys cancer cells by freezing
them.

Talk to your care team about how to manage
the side effects of hormone therapy. They
have ways to lessen or soothe most of these
problems. Bones can be strengthened with

needles to destroy cancer tissue or the entire
prostate. Cryotherapy affects only the prostate,
leaving the surrounding area unharmed. You’ll
be given anesthesia to relieve any pain during
the procedure.

Therapy may also be given as part of a
clinical trial. A clinical trial is a type of medical
research study. After being developed and
tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of
fighting cancer need to be studied in people.
If found to be safe and effective in a clinical
trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach
may be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Cryotherapy is not a standard treatment for
newly diagnosed prostate cancer. It’s mainly
used as a secondary therapy for people
with early prostate cancer whose cancer
returns after radiation treatment. Side effects
of cryotherapy can include pain, erectile
dysfunction, and urinary incontinence.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials.

High-intensity focused
ultrasound

Talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial
may make sense for you.

Like cryotherapy, high-intensity focused
ultrasound isn’t a standard treatment for newly
diagnosed prostate cancer. It’s mainly used
for early prostate cancer that returns after
radiation treatment.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

High-intensity focused ultrasound, or HIFU,
destroys prostate tissue with heat generated
by high-energy ultrasound waves. For this
procedure, an ultrasound probe is inserted into
the rectum. The probe focuses high-frequency
sound energy on the prostate, leaving the
surrounding tissue unaffected. The energy
converts into high heat, which vaporizes one
portion of tissue at a time until the entire tumor
is destroyed.







Side effects of HIFU are usually temporary
and include having to pee urgently or more
often, or having a weak or slower urine stream.
Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction
are also possible.

Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the long-term

4 Prostate cancer treatments » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in certain ways in
order to compare how their disease responds
to a specific treatment.

“

Without clinical trials, our
treatment wouldn’t change. It
would always remain the same.
Some people refer to clinical trials
as receiving tomorrow’s best
treatment today.”

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. This is
an agreement that confirms you’ve been fully
told about your part in the trial. Read the form
carefully and ask questions before signing it.
Take time to discuss it with family, friends, or
others you trust. Keep in mind that you can
leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical
trial at any time.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

Are clinical trials free?
There’s no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or childcare due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you will
continue to receive standard cancer care. This
care is billed to—and often covered by—your
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

Supportive care
Supportive care aims to improve your quality

symptoms caused by cancer and the side
effects caused by its treatment.

Finding a clinical trial

Supportive care addresses many needs:
relieving symptoms, preventing or lessening

Active surveillance is the preferred
strategy for most patients with lowerrisk prostate cancer and a longer life
expectancy.
Surgery removes the tumor along with
some normal-looking tissue around its
edge called a surgical margin. The goal of
surgery is to leave no cancer cells in the
surgical margin.

“

When you are deciding on your
treatment options, remember
that even though some decisions
need to be made fast, don’t rush.
Think through your options and
get second, or even third opinions.
Have people you can trust to talk
through your options so you feel
comfortable in your decisions.”

A radical prostatectomy removes the
whole prostate, the surrounding tissue,
the seminal vesicles, and sometimes the
nearby lymph nodes in the pelvis.
Radiation can kill cancer cells and stop
new cancer cells from being made.
Hormone therapy treats prostate cancer
by stopping testosterone from being
made or by blocking cancer cells from
using testosterone. It’s sometimes used
in combination with radiation therapy for
early-stage prostate cancer.
Castration describes a drastic reduction of
testosterone. This can be done surgically
or with drugs.

NCCN experts are concerned about
overtreatment of early-stage prostate cancer.
One result of overtreatment is that the
treatment might cause more problems than the
disease itself. For many patients, especially
those with lower risk prostate cancer, active
surveillance or observation can be better
options than direct treatment. Treatment
options, based on life expectancy, are
described next. Also see Guide 5.

If you have very-low-risk prostate cancer and
your life expectancy is 10 years or more,
options include:

If you have very-low-risk prostate cancer and
your life expectancy is less than 10 years,
observation is often recommended.

Active surveillance
Active surveillance is the preferred option if
you have slow-growing prostate cancer and
your life expectancy is 10 years or more. Tests
during active surveillance include prostatespecific antigen (PSA), digital rectal exam, MRI
scan, and biopsies. These tests are done on a
regular basis so that treatment can be started
when and if needed. See Guide 6.

Observation
This option is for those who have other
more serious health problems and whose
prostate cancer isn’t causing any symptoms.
Observation involves occasional PSA tests and
watching for symptoms, which can be treated
with palliative therapy.

To see if you’re a good candidate for active
surveillance, you may need a confirmatory MRI
(if you haven’t received an MRI already) with
or without a confirmatory prostate biopsy. All
patients should have a confirmatory prostate
biopsy 1 to 2 years after their initial biopsy.

Low risk

Radiation therapy
If you’ll likely live more than 10 years, you
may decide you want treatment now instead
of active surveillance. Low-risk cancers
can be treated with radiation therapy, either
external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or
brachytherapy.

The low-risk group includes patients who have
all of the following traits:


Stage T1 to T2a tumor



Grade Group 1



PSA of less than 10 ng/mL



Prostate surgery
Prostate surgery (radical prostatectomy)
removes the whole prostate. It's not a common
treatment option for people with low-risk
prostate cancer.

Cancer found in more than 3 biopsy
cores, but fewer than half of all cores
show cancer

Treatment options are based on life
expectancy. The initial treatment options for
low-risk disease are described next and shown
in Guide 7 on the next page.

In certain cases when prostate surgery is
chosen for a patient with low-risk prostate
cancer, the pathologist will look for signs of
disease called adverse (or high-risk) features.
See Guide 8 on the next page. If your
prostate cancer has adverse features after
prostate surgery, then you’ll be monitored or
perhaps have additional treatment to prevent
the cancer from returning. If test results don’t
show adverse features, then you can be
monitored for cancer recurrence.

Life expectancy: 10 years or more
If you have low-risk prostate cancer and your
life expectancy is 10 years or more, initial
treatment options are:
Active surveillance
Active surveillance is the preferred option if
you have slow-growing disease and you have
a longer life expectancy. See Guide 6.

Life expectancy: Less than
10 years
If you have low-risk prostate cancer and
your life expectancy is less than 10 years,
observation is often recommended.

To see if you’re a good candidate for active
surveillance, you may need a confirmatory
MRI (if you haven’t received an MRI already)
with or without a confirmatory prostate biopsy
and/or molecular biomarker testing. All patients
should have a confirmatory prostate biopsy 1
to 2 years after their initial biopsy.

5 Initial treatment for your risk group » Intermediate risk » Favorable intermediate risk

Intermediate risk

Favorable intermediate risk

The intermediate-risk group is for those who
don't have high-risk or very-high-risk group
features but do have one or more of the
following intermediate risk factors:

The favorable intermediate-risk subgroup is for
those who have all of the following traits:


1 intermediate risk factor
Grade Group 1 or 2



Stage T2b or T2c tumor





Grade Group 2 or 3





PSA 10 to 20 ng/mL

Less than half of biopsy cores show
cancer

Treatment options are based on life
expectancy. See Guide 9 on the next page.

The intermediate-risk group is further divided
into favorable and unfavorable subgroups.
Treatment is based on whether your prostate
cancer is favorable intermediate risk or
unfavorable intermediate risk:

Life expectancy: 10 years or more
If you have favorable intermediate-risk prostate
cancer and your life expectancy is 10 years or
more, there are three initial treatment options:
Active surveillance
Active surveillance consists of testing on a
regular basis so that treatment can be started
when needed. For favorable intermediate-risk
disease, you should be watched closely for
any changes. See Guide 6.

NCCN experts are concerned about
overtreatment of early-stage prostate cancer.
In certain cases, overtreatment may cause
more problems than the cancer itself.

To see if you’re a good candidate for active
surveillance, you may need a confirmatory MRI
(if you haven’t received an MRI already) with
or without a confirmatory prostate biopsy and/
or molecular biomarker testing.
Patients in the favorable intermediate-risk
group who have a low percentage of Gleason
pattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low PSA
density, and/or low genomic risk (according
to a molecular tumor analysis) are particularly
good candidates for active surveillance.

5 Initial treatment for your risk group » Favorable intermediate risk

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a treatment option for
some patients with favorable-intermediate risk.
Radiation treatments include either EBRT or
brachytherapy.

You might have additional treatment after
prostate surgery to help prevent the cancer
from returning. This is called adjuvant therapy.
Adjuvant therapy options are based on
whether high-risk (adverse) features are found
as a result of prostate surgery. Having adverse
features suggests that not all of the cancer
was removed during surgery. See Guide 8.

Prostate surgery
If you’re expected to live 10 years or more,
surgically removing your prostate (radical
prostatectomy) may be an option. Your pelvic
lymph nodes may also be removed if there’s
a small risk for cancer to spread to them.
Your urologist will determine this risk using
a nomogram. A surgical procedure called
a pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is
performed to remove the nodes and check
them for cancer.

If test results don’t find high-risk features after
prostate surgery, then you’ll be monitored
for recurrence of cancer. Monitoring involves
periodic PSA tests and sometimes digital
rectal exams. If your PSA level rises during
monitoring, you’ll have further tests to see if
the cancer has returned.

Life expectancy: 10 years or more
If you have unfavorable intermediate-risk
prostate cancer and your life expectancy is 10
years or more, your initial treatment options
include radical prostatectomy or radiation and
hormone therapy.
Prostate surgery
Surgically removing your prostate (radical
prostatectomy) may be an option. Your pelvic
lymph nodes may also be removed if there’s
a small risk for cancer to spread to them.
Your urologist will determine this risk using

therapy.

It’s OK to have bad days, but don’t
let yourself stay there. A positive
attitude goes a long way.”

Prostate surgery
If you’re expected to live more than 5 years,
a radical prostatectomy with the removal of
your pelvic lymph nodes (pelvic lymph node
dissection, or PLND) is an option for patients
in the high-risk group and certain patients in
the very-high-risk group. Your age and overall
health will be factors in deciding if this is a
good option for you.

If cancer has spread to your lymph nodes
but there are no other adverse features, then
monitoring is a reasonable option if your PSA
level is undetectable. However, if your PSA
level begins to rise during monitoring, you may
need treatment for PSA recurrence. Hormone
therapy (with or without EBRT) is also an
option for additional therapy. You might start the
hormone therapy right away with the option of
adding radiation therapy later. See Chapter 7:
Making treatment decisions.

You may receive additional treatment after
prostate surgery to help prevent the cancer
from returning. Treatment will be started after
you’ve healed from the prostate surgery.
Options for additional treatment after a
prostatectomy are based on whether you have
adverse (high-risk) features and/or cancer in
the lymph nodes after prostate surgery. See

Guide 8.

If test results find no adverse features, no
additional treatment is needed. Your cancer
will be monitored. Monitoring involves periodic
PSA tests and sometimes digital rectal
exams. If your PSA level begins to rise during
monitoring, you may need treatment for PSA
recurrence. See Chapter 7.
If test results find adverse features but no
cancer in the lymph nodes after surgery, the
preferred option is being monitored for cancer
recurrence. EBRT (with or without hormone
therapy) is also an additional treatment option.
EBRT targets areas where the cancer cells
have likely spread. Hormone therapy might be
added to EBRT to improve outcomes.

5 Initial treatment for your risk group » After treatment

After treatment

Life expectancy: 5 years or less
and no symptoms

After your initial treatment and your additional
treatment, if needed, you’ll be monitored for
any increase in PSA or cancer recurrence.
Monitoring involves these follow-up tests:

There are three options for high-risk or veryhigh-risk prostate cancer when life expectancy
is 5 years or less and you have no symptoms:
Observation
Observation is the option for most people in
these higher-risk groups. Observation involves
occasional PSA tests and watching for
symptoms, which can be treated with palliative
therapy. See Guide 11.





Hormone therapy
If observation isn’t a good fit, hormone therapy
is an option. Hormone therapy can be medical
or surgical castration. Medical castration is
treatment with drugs to drastically reduce
male hormones. Surgical castration is the
permanent surgical removal of one or both
testicles (orchiectomy).

Digital rectal exam, if your doctor
suspects cancer recurrence

If lymph node metastases are found while
you’re on hormone therapy or under
observation, or if your PSA (and digital rectal
exam, if performed) indicates the cancer has
returned, then you’ll have additional imaging
and discussions of your options. Options
may include ongoing monitoring or additional
(or different) treatment. See Chapter 6: PSA
persistence and recurrence.

Radiation therapy
EBRT is an option because it’s been shown to
be effective in patients with high-risk and veryhigh-risk prostate cancer.
Supportive care
In addition to these treatments, you may
also receive supportive care (palliative care).
Supportive care is for relieving the symptoms
caused by cancer and the side effects caused
by its treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, 2024

Testing for persistence or
recurrence

Even after treatment with prostate
surgery or radiation therapy, your
PSA level may not go down low

Before deciding on any treatment, you’ll need
some more tests to find out how aggressive
the cancer may be. Imaging is used to find out
whether cancer has returned in the pelvis or
another area of the body.

enough. Or your PSA level may
drop but, at some point, begin to
rise again. These are usually signs
that you’ll need further treatment.



If you had a radical prostatectomy, all the
cells that make PSA should be gone, so your
PSA level should be undetectable. If you had
radiation therapy, your PSA level should fall
steadily to near zero.



But in about 1 in 3 people with prostate cancer,
their PSA level either doesn’t drop low enough
(called PSA persistence) or it drops to near
zero buts eventually starts to rise again (called
PSA recurrence). PSA recurrence may not
happen for several years after initial treatment.



PSA persistence and PSA recurrence may
be signs that the cancer hasn’t fully gone
away or that it has come back in other parts
of the body. For these reasons, treatment for
PSA persistence and PSA recurrence often
includes both local and systemic (wholebody) therapies. The local therapy is usually
radiation, while systemic therapy involves
hormone treatment.
Most of the treatment options listed in this
chapter are for those with a life expectancy
of more than 5 years. For those with a life
expectancy of 5 years or less, observation
and/or supportive care (palliative therapy) may
be more reasonable options than undergoing
treatment.

PSA doubling time – This test
measures the time that the PSA level
takes to double. If it doubles in a short
amount of time (6 months or less, for
example), it suggests that the cancer is
growing quickly.
Imaging – This often includes imaging
the whole body.
Biopsy – If your PSA is elevated
or imaging shows possible cancer
somewhere, you may need a biopsy of
that area. A biopsy may be needed in the
prostate after radiation, in the prostate
bed after surgery, or somewhere else like
the seminal vesicles, a lymph node, or a
bone.

6 PSA persistence and recurrence » Treatment for persistence or recurrence

Treatment for persistence
or recurrence

After radiation therapy
If you have PSA recurrence and your initial
treatment was radiation therapy, your next
treatment depends on your latest test results:

If your life expectancy is more than 5 years,
treatment for PSA persistence or PSA
recurrence is based on whether your previous
treatment was radical prostatectomy or
radiation therapy. See Guide 12 on the
next page.

No other cancer found
If your PSA level is up but tests don’t find
cancer in pelvic lymph nodes or anywhere
else in the body, you may have another biopsy
or simply be monitored with regular testing. If
symptoms appear or treatment is needed, you
may be given hormone therapy or a radical
prostatectomy, if appropriate. Other, nonsurgical options include cryotherapy, highintensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), or more
radiation therapy.

After prostate surgery
If you have PSA persistence or PSA
recurrence and your initial therapy was radical
prostatectomy, your next treatment depends
on your latest test results:
No other cancer found
If your PSA level is up but tests don’t find
cancer in lymph nodes in the pelvis or
anywhere else in the body, the preferred
treatment is radiation therapy with or without
hormone therapy. Monitoring is an option for
certain patients.

Cancer in the pelvis
If tests find cancer in lymph nodes in the
pelvis, your options include monitoring or
treatment with hormone therapy (with or
without abiraterone). Other treatment options
(given with or without hormone therapy)
include radiation or dissection of pelvic lymph
nodes.

Cancer in the pelvis
If tests find cancer in lymph nodes in the
pelvis, then you may be given radiation
therapy, possibly combined with hormone
therapy. Additional hormone therapy with
abiraterone may also be included.

Cancer in another area of the body
If tests find that cancer has spread to another
area of the body, that means the cancer has
metastasized and needs more advanced
treatment. See the NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Advanced-Stage Prostate Cancer
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

What’s next?

Survivorship

After you’ve been treated for PSA persistence
or PSA recurrence, you’ll continue to have
tests and visits to treat your existing cancer or
to watch out for cancer to return. Surveillance
is a key part of your follow-up plan. Be sure to
continue to go to follow-up visits and stay in
touch with your treatment team.

Survivorship focuses on the health and wellbeing of a person with cancer, from diagnosis
until the end of life. This includes the physical,
mental, emotional, social, and financial effects
that begin at diagnosis, continue through
treatment, and arise afterward.
Survivorship also includes concerns about
follow-up care, late effects of treatment, cancer
recurrence, and quality of life. Support from
family members, friends, and caregivers is also
an important part of survivorship.

If the cancer comes back again but doesn’t
spread beyond the pelvis, you can continue
to have treatment for persistence/recurrence.
If the cancer comes back again but spreads
to another area of the body, you’ll need
more advanced treatment. See the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Advanced-Stage
Prostate Cancer. As always, you can ask to
join a clinical trial.

Read more about survivorship in the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Survivorship Care
for Healthy Living and Survivorship Care for
Cancer-Related Late and Long-Term Effects,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

It’s common to feel frustration, anger, regret,
despair, and uncertainty—even all at the
same time. Know that you can have prostate
cancer and still enjoy living after diagnosis and
treatment. Try to take as much pleasure in life
as possible. Talk with family or friends. Join a
support group to learn how other patients are
dealing with their cancer. Or talk to your doctor
or another member of your care team. They
can point you to professionals who can help
you deal with these feelings and guide you
toward your next steps.

If tests find that cancer has spread to
another area of the body, that means the
cancer has metastasized and needs more
advanced treatment.
You can have prostate cancer and still
enjoy life after diagnosis and treatment.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your care
team.

the cancer treatment you choose.
This choice starts with having an
open and honest conversation with
your care team about the benefits

Second opinion

and risks of treatment.

It’s normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer treatment shouldn’t
be ignored, there is usually time to have
another cancer care provider review your test
results and suggest a treatment plan. This
is called getting a second opinion, and it’s a
normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. In shared decision-making, you
and your providers share information, discuss
the options, and agree on a treatment plan. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment. It starts with
an open and honest conversation between you
and your team.

Seek out a prostate cancer specialist, if you
can, because they have experience diagnosing
and treating a lot of people with your type of
cancer.
Things you can do to prepare:

What you want and how that might differ
from what others want
Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or hormone therapy

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions.
There may be out-of-pocket costs to
see providers who are not part of your
insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Your feelings about pain or side effects
