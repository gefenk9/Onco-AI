About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Lung Cancer Screening Version 2.2023 – May 17, 2023.

Lung cancer screening basics » The lungs

The lungs

Lung cancer starts in the cells
of the lungs. For those at risk

The lungs are a pair of organs located in the
chest. The lungs move important gases in and
out of the blood. You breathe in oxygen and
exhale carbon dioxide (a gas made by cells)
from the body.

of developing lung cancer,
regular screening can help find
lung cancer at its earliest, most

The lungs have sections called lobes. The
left lung has 2 lobes and the right lung has
3 lobes. A thin layer of tissue surrounds the
lungs called the pleural membrane. This
membrane protects the lungs.

treatable stages.

Two large breathing tubes, called bronchi,
connect the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs.
There is one tube, called a bronchus, for
each lung. Inside the lungs are small tubes
(bronchioles) and small air sacs (alveoli).

The respiratory system
The air you breathe moves
through a series of airways. It
travels down your throat and
through your windpipe (trachea).
The windpipe splits into 2
airways called bronchi. Inside the
lung, each bronchus branches off
into the parts of the lung called
lobes. The right lung has 3 lobes
and the left lung has 2 lobes.
The bronchi divide into smaller
airways called the bronchioles.
At the end of the bronchioli are
sacs called alveoli. From here,
oxygen is transferred into your
blood.

Lung cancer



Almost all lung cancers are a subtype called
carcinomas. Lung carcinomas start in the cells
that line the airways of the lungs. The airways
of the lungs include the bronchus, bronchioles,
and alveoli.



There are different types of lung carcinoma.
The main types are non-small cell lung cancer
and small cell lung cancer. Other types of
cancer can spread to the lungs, such as breast
cancer. Breast cancer that has spread to the
lungs is still called breast cancer.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fast-dividing
cancer of the neuroendocrine cells. Under a
microscope, the cancer cells look small and
oval- or oat-shaped. It is the second most
common type of lung cancer. About 1 out of
every 10 lung cancers (10%) are SCLC.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a group
of cancers that are the most common type of
lung cancer.
NSCLC can be broken down into subtypes by
looking at the cancer cells under a microscope.
This is called histology.
Adenocarcinoma starts in the mucusmaking cells that line the alveoli (small
air sacs). This is the most common
subtype. About 4 out of 10 lung cancers
are adenocarcinomas. This is the most
common type of lung cancer seen in
those who don’t smoke or who don’t have
a history of smoking.

More information on NSCLC
and SCLC is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Lung Cancer Screening, 2023

Large cell (undifferentiated)
carcinoma starts in large cells that
can grow anywhere in the lungs. This
accounts for 1.5 out of 10 NSCLCs.

Small cell lung cancer

Non-small cell lung cancer



Squamous cell (epidermoid)
carcinoma starts in the flat cells that line
the inside of the airways (bronchi) in the
lungs. About 3 out of 10 lung cancers are
squamous cell carcinomas.

Early detection

Key points

The goal of lung cancer screening is to find
lung cancer at an early stage, even before
there are any symptoms. This is when
treatment will be most successful. Early
detection of lung cancer helps prevent death.
Together, you and your health care provider
should discuss if screening is right for you.









Lung cancer screening
is not recommended for
everyone. Screening is for
those at risk for developing
lung cancer. Ask your
health care provider if you
qualify for lung cancer
screening. Your wishes are
always important. Talk to
your health care provider
and make your wishes
known.

Risk factors

Risk is your chance of developing
lung cancer. Some people

Risk is your chance of developing lung cancer.
Everyone has some risk for developing
lung cancer. However, some people are at
increased risk. Risk factors can be activities
that people do, things in the environment, or
traits passed down from biological parents to
children through genes. Genes are a set of
instructions that tell new cells what to become
(for example, lung, heart, and skin) and what
to do (make hormones, absorb nutrients, and
kill germs). Known risk factors for lung cancer
are listed in Guide 1.

are more likely than others to
develop lung cancer. Anything
that increases your chances of
developing lung cancer is called a
risk factor. Lung cancer screening
is based on your risk factors
described in this chapter.

See your health care provider (HCP) regularly
for checkups and cancer screenings, which
may include screenings for skin, breast,
prostate cancer, and other types of cancer.
You might be asked to see your HCP more
than every year based on your risk factors for
developing lung cancer. As your family health
history changes, it is important to keep your
HCP updated.

Risk assessment » Risk factors

Tobacco smoke

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit

Smoking tobacco is the biggest risk factor for
developing lung cancer. It is a modifiable risk.
This means you can take steps to change
your risk level by quitting smoking. Smoking
tobacco causes lung cancer and accounts for
8.5 out of 10 lung cancer deaths. Smoking also
increases the risk for other cancers, such as:


Head and neck



Kidney



Bladder



Pancreatic



Stomach



Cervical



Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

A history of smoking or vaping nicotine
increases your chances of developing
lung and other cancers. Smoking
and vaping can limit how well cancer
treatment works and prevents wound
healing. It also greatly increases your
chances of having side effects during and
after surgery. Marijuana use might also
affect the amount of anesthesia used
during surgery.
Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that
makes you want to keep smoking and
vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging
for most people who smoke or vape. The
stress of having cancer may make it even
harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask
your care team about counseling and
medicines to help you quit.

Tobacco smoke has over 7,000 chemicals,
and at least 70 of them cause cancer. The
more you smoke, the higher your risk. If you
quit smoking, your risk will decrease. Those
who smoked in the past have a higher risk of
developing lung cancer than people who never
smoked. Current or past tobacco smoking is a
risk factor for lung cancer. It is never too late to
stop smoking.

Radon

•

BeTobaccoFree.gov

Radon is radioactive gas found in nature that
can cause lung cancer. You cannot see or
smell radon. Radon gas is given off by soil
or rock and can enter buildings and homes.
The risk for lung cancer may depend on how
much radon is in the home and the number of
years you have been exposed. For people who
have been exposed to radon, the risk for lung
cancer is higher for those who smoke than for
those who don’t smoke.

Other cancer-causing agents

History of lung disease

Besides radon, other cancer-causing agents
that target the lungs include the following:

A history of either chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary
fibrosis increases your risk of lung cancer. In
COPD the lung tissue is damaged causing
a cough and too much mucus. Pulmonary
fibrosis scars and thickens the tissue around
and between the air sacs (alveoli) in your lungs
making it hard to breathe. COPD includes
emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD and
pulmonary fibrosis are chronic lung diseases
that cause damage and inflammation of the
lungs. The chronic damage and inflammation
increase the risk of lung cancer.



Arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium,
and nickel



Asbestos



Coal smoke, soot, silica, and diesel fumes

If you have been exposed to these agents, the
risk for lung cancer is higher if you smoke than
if you have never smoked.

History of cancer
If you’ve had other cancers, you might have an
increased risk for lung cancer. The following
increases your risk of developing new lung
cancer:


If you had lung cancer



If you had lymphoma





Second-hand smoke
Second-hand smoke is smoke from burning
tobacco products, such as cigarettes,
cigars, or pipes. It is also smoke that has
been exhaled, or breathed out, by a person
smoking. Second-hand smoke by itself is
not considered a risk factor for lung cancer.
However, second-hand smoke combined
with other risk factors increases the risk of
lung cancer. Lung cancer screening is not
recommended for people whose only risk
factor is contact with second-hand smoke.

If you had a smoking-related cancer, like
kidney, bladder, or head and neck cancer
If you had chest radiation therapy or
alkylating agent (type of chemotherapy)
treatment

Family history of lung cancer
You have an increased risk of lung cancer if a
close family (biological) relative has had lung
cancer. Your risk is greater if your relative was
diagnosed at a young age or if more than one
relative has had lung cancer.

Risk assessment » Find out your level of risk » Care team

Find out your level of risk

Lung cancer screening is not recommended
for everyone. Ask your health care provider
(HCP) to share information regarding potential
benefits, risks, and limitations of lung cancer
screening. Shared decision-making between
you and your HCP is encouraged.

The decision to undergo lung cancer screening
is based on a risk assessment that includes
your lung cancer risk factors, your overall
health, if you have or had lung cancer, or if you
have other serious health issues. All of this
information is considered when placing you
into a risk group. In general, risk groups are
divided by age and pack-years of smoking. A
pack-year is the number of packs of cigarettes
you smoked every day multiplied by the
number of years you smoked.




Care team
Lung cancer screening should be part of a
larger program of care and not done by itself.
Doctors or medical staff from different areas
of medicine should work together with you to
decide on a lung screening plan.

High risk – 50 years of age and over
with a 20 pack-year or more history
of smoking cigarettes. Lung cancer
screening is recommended. People at
high risk for lung cancer may benefit from
low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)
screening.

For lung cancer screening, specialists from
these areas might be included in your program
of care:


Low risk – Under 50 years of age
or less than a 20 pack-year history
of smoking cigarettes. Lung cancer
screening is not recommended.

Thoracic (chest) radiology – a
thoracic radiologist is an expert in reading

Start before you have
symptoms

Lung cancer screening
saves lives by
detecting cancer
earlier, when it can
be treated more
successfully.

Screening can help find disease early, even
before symptoms occur. The earlier lung
cancer is found, the more likely it is to be
cured with treatment. The goal of lung cancer
screening is to find lung cancer in those
who are at a high risk for lung cancer. Most
lung cancer is found when cancer is more
advanced, often after symptoms appear. The
later lung cancer is found, the more difficult it is
to treat and less likley it is to be cured.
See your health care provider (HCP) if you
have any of the following symptoms:

Tell your HCP about:



Cough that lasts





Blood in mucus





Shortness of breath



Wheezing



Pain in chest area



Tiredness that lasts



Pneumonia



Pain when swallowing



Weight loss



Most often, these symptoms are caused by
health issues other than lung cancer. Your
HCP can help you decide if a screening test
is right for you or if you should consider other
kinds of tests.

A low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)
test is recommended as part of lung cancer
screening. It uses small amounts of radiation
and computer technology to take pictures of
the inside of the body from different angles.
The amount of radiation used is much lower
than standard doses of a CT scan. Contrast

results.

Imaging tests
Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body. A radiologist, an expert in
interpreting imaging tests, will write a report
and send this report to your health care
provider (HCP). It is likely that the report will be
sent directly to you through your patient portal
or patient access system. You should discuss
these results with your HCP.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that
help enhance and improve the images of
several organs and structures in the body. It is
used to make the pictures clearer. The contrast
is not permanent and will leave the body in
your urine immediately after the test. The types
of contrast vary and are different for CT and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Contrast
is not used in LDCT tests, but might be used in
a chest CT.

What is the difference between
screening and diagnostic tests?




Screening is done on a regular basis even
when there are no signs or symptoms.
Diagnostic tests are done when there are
signs or symptoms.

The following imaging tests are not listed in
order of importance. You will not have all of
these tests.

PET scan

Before starting a screening
plan, talk with your health care
provider about all of the possible
benefits and risks of the plan.

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive sugar molecule called a
tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a
vein to see where cancer spots might be in
the body and if they are using sugar produced
by your body to grow. Cancer spots show up
as bright areas on PET scans. However, not
all tumors will appear on a PET scan and not
all bright spots are cancer. It is normal for the
brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright
on the PET scan. Inflammation or infection can
also show up as a bright spot. When a PET
scan is combined with CT, it is called a PETCT scan.

Benefits should include:

3 Longer survival and better quality of
life

3 Less testing and treatment
3 Support to quit smoking or vaping
tobacco

3 Possible discovery of other treatable
health conditions

A PET scan may be used to see if a nodule
found on a screening LDCT contains cancer
cells. However, very small nodules are not
easily seen on PET. These nodules could be
the size of a large pea or smaller. Cancers
of that size don’t use enough sugar to be
detected. However, PET-CT scans are not
used as the first test to screen for lung cancer.

3 Peace of mind

A CT machine is large
and has a tunnel in
the middle. During the

Screening tests » Types of lung nodules

Types of lung nodules

Density

Screening with LDCT is used to find nodules
in the lungs. Nodules are small, round areas
of tissue and are quite common. They appear
as round, white shadows on an LDCT test.
Nodules can be caused by cancer, infection,
scar tissue, or other conditions. Most nodules
are not cancer (benign). People can have one
or more lung nodules found during the LDCT
test.

Radiologists or other experts will look at how
dense or solid a nodule is. Density is how
solid versus hazy a nodule looks on the LDCT
pictures. A solid nodule has a higher density
than a hazy one. Not all nodules are cancer.
Nodules are divided into groups based on
density.
There are 3 main types of lung (pulmonary)
nodules.

Features of the nodule



Nodules caused by cancer have specific traits.





They aren’t likely to have calcium buildup.
They often have rough edges (called
spiculations) and odd shapes.



They often grow faster, are more dense,
and are larger in size than nodules that
are not cancer.

If a lung nodule is new or has changed in size,
shape, density, or appearance, your HCP may
recommend further testing.


Size
Many of the nodules found on screening are
small, about the size of a pea, and most of
these nodules are not cancer. Nodules are
measured in mm (millimeters) and are rounded
to the nearest whole number. A new crayon
point is about 2 mm long, a pea is about 5 mm,
and a marble is about 13 mm.

Part-solid nodules or mixed solid
nodules have both solid and non-solid
(called ground-glass) areas. This means
they have both high- and low-density
areas. Part-solid nodules are mainly
adenocarcinomas. Part-solid nodules
have the greatest chance of being lung
cancer.
Non-solid nodules look like a fuzzy or
hazy cloud on an LDCT picture. These
nodules are also called a ground-glass
opacity (GGO) or a ground-glass nodule
(GGN). Non-solid nodules are usually
followed by more LDCT tests. Even if
non-solid nodules are cancer, these are
considered the kind of cancer that is
unlikely to grow and spread.

Solid and part-solid nodules are more likely
to be invasive and faster-growing cancers. All
nodules will be closely monitored during lung
cancer screening. You might have tests more
often to track any changes in size, density,
and appearance of nodules. If you have any
questions about your nodules or the chance

Nodules with cancer often grow faster and
larger than those that are benign. There is an
increased risk of cancer if a nodule is located
in the upper lobes, especially the upper right
lobe.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Lung Cancer Screening, 2023

Solid nodules look about as solid as
your muscle does on an LDCT picture.
This means they have a high density.

sign of cancer.

that it might be cancer, talk to your health care
provider (HCP).

Often, an LDCT detects a nodule, but the
results aren’t clear if the nodule is cancer
or benign (not cancer). Sometimes, a chest
CT scan with contrast or PET scan might be
ordered. A chest CT uses x-rays and computer
technology to take images. The amount of
radiation in a chest CT is higher than in an
LDCT scan. A PET scan would check for
disease throughout your body, and not just the
chest area.

Overview of screening tests
Screening tests are repeated over time to see
if a nodule may be cancer. The timing and type
of screening test depend on whether there are
changes in a nodule’s size, density, or both.
The type of lung screening test recommended
is a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).
The first LDCT is called the baseline test. All
future scheduled LDCT tests, called follow-ups,
will be compared to this baseline test. Nodules
over certain cutoff sizes on the baseline LDCT
determine the risk a nodule is cancer and are
used by your health care team to recommend
the next steps. Follow-up LDCT scans are
used to look for new nodules and changes in
shape, size, or density of nodules seen on the

Risks with testing
There are risks with any test. The LDCT
might pick up unusual areas (abnormalities)
that look like cancer but are not cancer. This
error is called a false-positive result. With a
false positive, you might have cancer-related
tests, like a biopsy, only to find out you do not

You need an order from a medical
provider before a screening test

have cancer. The risk is that you might have
tests that cost money and that you do not
need. Follow-up for a positive result is usually
another LDCT test, not a biopsy. Given the
number of false-positive results, you should
discuss the risks and benefits of LDCT tests
with your health care provider (HCP) before
starting screening.

Most testing sites and insurance companies
require a doctor's order or prescription before
you have an LDCT test. Check with your
insurance company to make sure you have
met all the requirements before a lung cancer
screening test. For example, the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requires
not only that you meet certain risk factors, but
that you receive counseling and participate in
shared decision-making with your HCP. This
must be done before lung cancer screening. If
you have questions, ask your HCP.

A false negative is when LDCT test results are
clear, but you later find out that you have lung
cancer. A false negative might give you a false
sense of comfort. It might cause you to ignore
symptoms that might have led to more tests.
Screening only those who are at high risk
for developing lung cancer helps to prevent
unneeded testing. Shared decision-making
with your HCP is the best way to decide to
start a lung cancer screening program. In
shared decision-making, you and your HCP
share information, weigh screening risks and
benefits, and agree on a plan that works for
you and your situation.

A screening plan will include the timing of the
LDCT tests. Keep the following in mind:






You need a prescription or an order from
a medical provider before scheduling a
screening test.



Find a screening site that provides LDCT
tests.



Decide on a screening plan that has many
benefits and few risks.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Lung Cancer Screening, 2023

20

Lung cancer screening should start before
cancer symptoms appear.
Only those at high risk for lung cancer
should consider a screening program.
An LDCT test is recommended as part of
lung cancer screening.
Many people have lung nodules. Nodules
can be caused by cancer, infections, scar
tissue, or other conditions.
Often, screening tests are repeated over
time to determine if a nodule may be
cancer.
The schedule and type of screening test
depend on whether there are changes in
a nodule’s size, density, or both.

A low-dose computed tomography

Solid lung nodule

(LDCT) test is recommended

If a solid lung nodule is found during your
baseline LDCT, what is done next depends on
the size and traits of the nodule. Usually, small
nodules less than 15 mm will have a followup LDCT scan done in 6 to 12 months to see
if the nodule changes. For larger nodules, a
chest CT and/or PET-CT scan and/or biopsy is
recommended.

for lung cancer screening. The
first LDCT is called the baseline
test. All future LDCT tests, called
follow-ups, will be compared to
this baseline test.

A nodule that is 15 mm or larger has the
highest risk of cancer. Depending on the
results of a chest CT and/or PET-CT, the next
step might be to remove one or more samples
of tissue (biopsy) or remove the entire nodule
(surgical excision) to check for cancer. If no
cancer is found, your next LDCT should be in
12 months. If cancer is confirmed, your health
care team will work with you to develop a
treatment plan.

Baseline LDCT
Your initial or very first LDCT test is called the
baseline LDCT.
A first follow-up LDCT scan is done to
compare to your baseline LDCT.

You will have other follow-up LDCT tests every
year or more often. The timing of your followup LDCTs are based on your risk factors for
developing lung cancer and results of your
previous LDCTs.

The timing of follow-up LDCTs is based on
your risk factors for developing lung cancer
and results of your previous LDCTs.

Baseline LDCT test results
For baseline LDCT test results for solid and
part-solid lung nodules, see Guide 2.

No lung nodules
If no lung nodules are found on the baseline
LDCT, then your next LDCT should be in 12
months. This would be your first follow-up
LDCT. After that, you will continue to have
LDCT tests every 12 months (annually).

Solid endobronchial nodule

Order of screening tests

If a solid endobronchial (inside the windpipe)
nodule is found, your health care provider
(HCP) might recommend another LDCT in 1
month or less. This is so the radiologist can
see if the nodule is just phlegm (thick mucus)
or is an actual growth. Just before your
LDCT, the technician will ask you to cough
vigorously to help remove phlegm. If there
is still an endobronchial nodule on the new
LDCT, then a bronchoscopy should be done.
A bronchoscopy is when a long, thin camera
is guided into the airway to look at or remove
tissue.

confirmed, your health care team will work with

If there is a high concern for cancer, the next
step would be to remove one or more samples
of tissue (biopsy) or remove the entire nodule
(surgical excision) to check for cancer. Once
tissue or the nodule is removed, a pathologist
will look at the cells under a microscope to see
if cancer is present. If no cancer is found, your

Baseline LDCT results: Solid and part-solid lung nodules

Solid nodule

• Smaller than 6 mm, next LDCT should be in 12 months
• 6 to 7 mm, follow-up LDCT in 6 months
• 8 to 15 mm, follow-up LDCT in 3 months or consider a PET-CT
• 15 mm or larger, then a chest CT and/PET-CT scan and/or biopsy is
recommended

Part-solid
nodule

• Smaller than 6 mm, next LDCT should be in 12 months
• 6 mm or larger with a solid part smaller than 6 mm, next LDCT should be in 6
months
• 6 mm or larger with a solid part of between 6 and 8 mm, next LDCT should
be in 3 months or a PET-CT is possible
• Solid part of 8 mm or larger, then a chest CT and/or PET-CT

Part-solid lung nodule

Non-solid lung nodule

A nodule may contain an area or areas that are
more solid than the rest of the nodule. These
are called part-solid nodules and both the
whole nodule and the solid area are measured.

Many non-solid nodules can be followed-up
with an LDCT every 12 months. You should
have an LDCT in 6 months for a non-solid lung
nodule that is 20 mm or larger. An olive or a
cherry is about 20 mm.

The timing of your next LDCT screening test
is based on both the size of the whole nodule
and size of the solid part. PET-CT scans have
trouble measuring nodules that are 8 mm or
less or are in certain locations of the lung.
This is why your care team will consider other
factors before ordering a PET-CT when the
part-solid nodule is in this size range.

Non-solid nodules may be cancer, but they
may also be small areas of infection or
inflammation. Large nodules are more likely
to be cancer than small nodules. If a non-solid
nodule develops a solid part on a future LDCT,
this is a sign it could be cancer. The LDCT test
will focus on taking pictures of the solid part of
any part-solid nodule.

If there is high concern for cancer, the next
step would be to remove one or more samples
of tissue (biopsy) or remove the entire nodule
(surgical excision) to check for cancer. Once
tissue or the nodule is removed, a pathologist
will look at the cells under a microscope to see
if cancer is present. If no cancer is found, your
next LDCT should be in 12 months. If cancer is
confirmed, your health care team will work with
you to develop a treatment plan.

Lung nodule
A lung nodule is a small
mass of tissue in the lung.
Many people have lung
nodules. Most are not cancer.
When nodules are found by
imaging, you may receive
more scans to assess if the
nodule is cancer.

Follow-up LDCT

Solid lung nodule on follow-up

If you have a new or growing nodule, it might
be tested more often than every 12 months.
The nodule size and density are also factors.

The timing of the next LDCT test is based
on the size of the solid nodule and whether
the nodule is new or growing. Your HCP
will compare the results from all of your
tests to decide when you should have
the next test. A new, smaller solid nodule
might be tested sooner than a larger
nodule that has not changed over time.
Sometimes, additional tests such as a chest
CT or PET-CT scan are recommended.

New lung nodule on follow-up
Inflammation or infection might be the reason
behind a new nodule found on a follow-up
or yearly LDCT. If your health care provider
(HCP) thinks this is the reason, then a followup LDCT will be in 1 to 3 months. During this
time, your HCP may treat the infection or
inflammation. Ongoing LDCT follow-up tests
depend on if the infection or inflammation
does or does not go away. If you have any
questions, ask your HCP.

A chest CT or PET-CT scan might be ordered
when there is concern for cancer. If there is a
high concern for cancer, a biopsy or surgical
excision (removal) of the solid lung nodule can
confirm cancer. If cancer is confirmed, then
treatment will start. If no cancer is found, then
you will have LDCT tests every 12 months. For
more information on the timing of your next
LDCT for non-solid nodules, see Guide 3.

nodule and the solid part. For more information
on the timing of your next LDCT for part-solid
nodules, see Guide 4.

In a part-solid nodule, both the whole nodule
and the solid part are measured.

You will have further testing based on the
nodule size and concern for cancer. If there
is a low concern for cancer, you will have an
LDCT. If there is a high concern for cancer, you
will have removal of part of all of the nodule
for testing (biopsy or surgical excision). This
is done instead of waiting to see if anything
changes over time. A biopsy or surgical
excision of the nodule can confirm if cancer is
present.

The timing of your next LDCT screening test is
based on the following:

Size of the whole nodule and size of the
solid part

LDCT tests and results » Biopsy

Non-solid lung nodule on followup

A biopsy removes a small sample of tissue
from the lung nodule. A needle biopsy can be
done either by a radiologist through the skin
into the nodule or by a pulmonologist using
a scope passed through the mouth while you
are asleep into the windpipe to the nodule
area. Surgery or surgical excision removes the
entire nodule for testing. Since a biopsy only
removes a very small piece of the nodule, the
results could be incomplete. There may be
cancer cells in another part of the nodule. If
your risk for cancer is high, surgery might be
recommended to remove the whole nodule.
Your health care provider may suggest
another biopsy, surgery, or more testing if the
first biopsy shows no cancer, but cancer is
suspected.

If a non-solid nodule has disappeared or
gotten smaller between tests, there is a
chance it was a small infection and not cancer.
For new (4 mm or larger), stable, or growing
non-solid nodules, see below:










For a new or stable (not growing) nonsolid nodule smaller than 20 mm, your
next LDCT should be in 12 months.
For a new 20 mm or larger non-solid
nodule, your next LDCT should be in 6
months.
For a stable 20 mm or larger non-solid
nodule, your next LDCT should be in 12
months.

Biopsy results

If a nodule has grown more than 1.5 mm
or become more solid since the last test, it
may be cancer. Because of this concern,
an LDCT should be in 6 months or your
care team will consider a biopsy or
removal of the nodule (surgical excision).

When no cancer is found in the biopsy or
surgical tissue, yearly screening is suggested.
Sometimes a sample of tissue from the biopsy
does not have enough cells to check for
cancer or may be abnormal but not cancer.
Ask your health care provider (HCP) if you
have any questions about your test results and
when your next test might be.

If there are multiple non-solid nodules,
then the next test will be based on the
size of the largest nodule.

If cancer cells are found in the biopsy
sample, read the NCCN Patient Guidelines
for treatment options recommended for
every stage of lung cancer at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Biopsy
A biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample
of tissue or fluid. The sample is sent to a lab
for testing. A pathologist will examine the
sample under the microscope to determine
if the tissue is not cancer (benign) or due to
cancer (malignant). Biopsy results can be
found in a pathology report. Ask questions
about your biopsy results and what it means
for next steps.
