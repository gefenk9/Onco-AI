Breast cancer screening basics

The breast

Breast cancer starts in the cells of the
breast. Regular screening and breast
exams help find breast cancer at its
earliest, most treatable stages.

tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the
nipple to carry breast milk.
The ring of darker breast skin is called the
areola. The raised tip within the areola is called
the nipple. The nipple-areola complex is a term
that refers to both parts.

The breast

Lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water
and food. It also helps to fight germs or tumor
cells. Lymph drains from breast tissue into
lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near
your armpit (axilla). Nodes near the armpit are
called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs).

The breast is an organ and a gland found
on the chest. The breast is made of milk
ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels,
ligaments, and other connective tissue. Behind
the breast is the pectoral muscle and ribs.
Muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in
place.
Breast tissue contains glands that can make
milk. These milk glands are called lobules.
Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small

Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast.
Almost all breast cancers are carcinomas.
Carcinomas are cancers that start in the cells
that line the inner or outer surfaces of the
body.
There are different types of breast carcinoma.
The most common types are either ductal or
lobular.


Ductal carcinoma starts in the cells that
line the milk ducts. Ductal carcinoma is
the most common type of breast cancer.



Lobular carcinoma starts in the lobules
(milk glands) of the breast.

Anyone can develop breast cancer, including
those assigned male at birth. Although there
are some differences between those assigned
male and those assigned female at birth,
treatment is very similar for all genders.

Health care providers

Breast cancer screening aims to find breast
cancer early. Breast cancer found earlier is
treated more successfully, reducing the risk
of dying from breast cancer. This book will
cover screening recommendations for those
assigned female at birth. It will also discuss
screening and testing options for those who
are pregnant or lactating (breastfeeding),
and those with breast pain, nipple discharge,
changes in the skin, lumps, or other symptoms
that require further testing.

During regular health checkups and
breast cancer screening, you might come
in contact with the following health care
providers (HCPs):
•

Breast specialist is an expert in breast
health and disease.

•

Breast diagnostic radiologist
interprets the results of mammograms,
MRIs, and other imaging tests, and
performs needle biopsies as needed.

•

Gynecologist diagnoses and treats
diseases of the female reproductive
organs.

•

Lactation consultant specializes in
breastfeeding.

•

Mammogram, MRI, and ultrasound
technologists operate the mammogram
unit, or MRI or ultrasound machine.

•

Advanced practice providers are
nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
and certified nurse midwives who can
help prevent, evaluate, examine, and
diagnose human disease, including
breast cancer.

•

Obstetrician specializes in pregnancy
and in childbirth.

•

Pathologist analyzes the cells, tissues,
and organs removed during a biopsy or
surgery.

•

Primary care provider (PCP) or
physician gives a wide range of care,
including prevention and treatment.

Transgender individuals

Due to lack of evidence, this book does not
provide screening guidance for transgender
individuals. Transgender individuals should
consult with their primary care physician to
determine when/whether screening would be
appropriate.

Those assigned male at birth

Those assigned male at birth do not undergo
regular mammogram screening. However, if
you have breast pain or redness, or a change
in the size and shape of one breast, then
see your health care provider and read about
recommended tests in Chapter 5.

Screening and diagnostic tests

Screening vs. diagnostic | General health

This chapter provides an overview of
the various imaging tests used from
breast cancer screening and diagnosis.
Ask questions and keep copies of your
test results. Online patient portals are a
great way to access your test results.

medical or health history will help determine
which treatment is best for you.

Family history

Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your health care provider will ask
about the health history of family members
who are blood relatives. This information is
called a family history. Ask family members
about their health issues like heart disease,
cancer and type of cancer, and diabetes, and
at what age they were diagnosed.

What is the difference between
screening and diagnostic tests?




Screening is done on a regular
basis when there are no symptoms.
For example, an annual screening
mammogram is done once a year to
detect breast cancer before you have
symptoms or anything abnormal before
you have symptoms.

Physical exam

During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:

Diagnostic tests are done when there
are signs or symptoms such as a lump
that can be felt in the breast, changes in
the skin of the breast or nipple, or nipple
discharge. With breast symptoms, the
most frequent diagnostic tests used are
mammograms, breast ultrasound, or both.

General health tests
Medical history

Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate.



Check your weight and height.



Listen to your lungs and heart.



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat.



Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.



Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

Clinical breast exam

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness, prior
surgery, or injury and when it happened.
Bring a list of old and new medicines and
any over-the-counter medicines, herbals, or
supplements you take. Tell your health care
provider about any symptoms you have. A

Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam
of the bare breast performed by a health care
provider to check for lumps or other changes.
It is done while you are seated and/or lying
down. Your provider should take time to
palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the
armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in
the room during the exam.

Increase sharpness of the picture

You will be asked to stand very still and may
need to hold your breath for a few seconds
while the pictures are being taken. You will be
asked to change positions between images.
The process will be repeated for the other
breast.

Mammogram
A mammogram is a picture of the inside of
your breast. The picture is made using x-rays.
A computer combines the x-rays to make
detailed pictures.

Screening mammogram

A screening mammogram is the only imaging
test that has been found to reduce death from
breast cancer. It is a test that uses low-dose
x-rays to take four standard pictures of your
breast (two on each side). A radiologist then
reviews the images and determines if you
need additional imaging. If you need additional
imaging, you will likely have a diagnostic
mammogram.

Screening mammograms are annual
preventive exams. Diagnostic mammograms
are done when there are signs or symptoms in
the breast or armpit. A diagnostic mammogram
is more detailed than a screening
mammogram. A screening mammogram
only takes about 10 to 20 minutes, while a
diagnostic mammogram can be longer.

Diagnostic mammogram

Both screening and diagnostic mammograms
use low-dose x-rays to examine the
breast. They may use either the standard
2-dimensional (2D) digital mammography or
3-dimensional (3D) mammograms known as
tomosynthesis.

A diagnostic mammogram might be done
after a screening mammogram or for an
abnormal finding such as a breast lump or
nipple discharge. A radiologist will evaluate
the diagnostic mammogram while you wait so
if additional breast imaging is needed, it can
be done right away. Diagnostic mammograms
include extra compression in certain areas of
the breast, magnification views, or rolling the
breast to image additional areas of the breast.

A mammogram is performed on an outpatient
basis. During mammography, a specially
trained technologist will position your breast

Mammogram findings

Tomosynthesis

Tomosynthesis, or 3D mammograms, are a
newer type of digital mammogram that may
help to see small abnormal areas of the breast
more easily. It takes multiple thin images that
are then put together to make a complete
picture. Tomosynthesis can decrease call
back rates (the need for additional x-rays)
and improve cancer detection. This is why 3D
mammograms are recommended, if available
in your area.

Calcifications

Calcifications are deposits of calcium in the
tissues. Calcification in the breast can be seen
on a mammogram, but cannot be detected by
touch.
There are 2 types of breast calcification:

Contrast-enhanced mammogram

Contrast-enhanced mammography is a new
technology that uses contrast material to
improve the pictures of the inside of the breast.
For those at increased risk for breast cancer,
contrast-enhanced screening mammogram is
an option.

Macrocalcifications are large deposits
and are usually not related to cancer.



Microcalcifications are specks of
calcium that may be found in an
area of rapidly dividing cells. Many
microcalcifications clustered together may
be a sign of cancer.

Distortion

This term describes when an area of the
breast tissue appears at an odd angle, fuzzy or
misshapened on a mammogram, particularly
when compared to the other breast. This may
just be due to how the breast was positioned
during the mammogram. It might also be
caused by a prior injury, procedure done on
the breast, or a breast cancer.

Dense breasts

Breasts are composed of fat and soft tissue.
Dense breasts have more soft tissue than
fat. Having dense breast tissue may make it
harder to see breast cancer or other changes
in the breast on a mammogram. It can also
increase your risk of developing breast
cancer. If you have dense breast tissue, your
HCP should discuss the risks and benefits of
additional screening.

Masses

A mass is an area of abnormal breast tissue.
A mass could be solid, fluid-filled (cyst), or a
combination of both. A mass might be seen
with or without calcifications. Some masses
can be watched over time with regular
mammograms or ultrasound to see if they
change, but others may need to be checked
with a biopsy.

Your mammogram report will also include an
assessment of your breast density, which is a
description of how much fibrous and glandular
tissue is in your breasts, as compared to
fatty tissue. The denser your breasts, the
harder it can be to see abnormal areas on
mammograms. Having dense breasts also
slightly raises your risk of getting breast
cancer.

Screening and diagnostic tests

Ultrasound

Asymmetries

What’s the difference
between a screening and
diagnostic mammogram?

Asymmetries are white areas seen on a
mammogram that look different from the
normal breast tissue pattern, particularly when
compared to the other breast. Different types
of asymmetries include focal asymmetry,
developing asymmetry, and global asymmetry.
Further imaging will likely be needed to get a
better look at the area.

A mammogram is a picture of the inside
of your breast made using x-rays. During
a mammogram, the breast is pressed
between two plates while you stand in
different positions. Multiple x-rays will be
taken. A computer combines the x-rays to
make detailed pictures.

Ultrasound
An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. Ultrasound does not use x-rays.
It is frequently used without mammogram for
diagnosis of breast symptoms in those under
30 years of age or with mammogram in those
30 years of age and over.

•

Screening mammograms are done on a
regular basis when there are no signs or
symptoms of breast cancer. Results take
a few days.

•

Diagnostic mammograms are used
for those who have symptoms such
as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or
discharge, or whose breasts have
changed shape or size.

•

Diagnostic mammograms are also used
to take a closer look at an abnormal
area found in a screening mammogram.

•

A radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic
mammogram while you wait so if
additional testing is needed, it can be
done right away.

Screening and diagnostic tests

Other imaging tests

Other imaging tests

Contrast material will be used to improve the
pictures of the breast. For a breast MRI, a
gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)–a
rare, heavy metal–is used to enhance the
quality of the MRI. There are no harmful effects
from GBCA, but it may linger in the body for
months to years afterward. Talk to your doctor
if you have any concerns.

Breast MRI

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. MRI
does not use radiation. If needed, an MRI
would be used in addition to a mammogram.
If you are at high risk for breast cancer, an
annual breast MRI might be recommended.
Because of the very strong magnets used in
the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you
have any metal in your body.

Also, tell your care team if you have had
allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This
is important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies.

Breast sections
Quadrants are used to describe
tumor location. Each breast
is divided into 4 sections or
quadrants. They are the upper
outer quadrant (near the armpit),
the upper inner quadrant (near
the center of the body), the lower
outer quadrant, and the lower
inner quadrant. The nipple area is
called the nipple-areola complex
(NAC).

What is your family
cancer health history?
Some cancers and other diseases run in
families – those who are related to you
through genes passed down from parent
to child. This information is called a family
health history. Ask blood relatives about
their health issues like heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they
were diagnosed. For relatives who were
diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or other
relatives if they are no longer living) what
type of cancer they had, if they died from
the cancer, and at what age the cancer was
diagnosed.

Molecular breast imaging

Molecular breast imaging uses a radioactive
tracer and special camera to find breast
cancer. Molecular imaging such as breastspecific gamma imaging or sestamibi scan
may improve detection. However, whole body
radiation dose is much higher than that of
standard mammograms. Molecular breast
imaging is not a common breast screening
imaging test.

Start by asking your parents, siblings,
and children. Next, talk to half-siblings,
aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews,
grandparents, and grandchildren.
Write down what you learn about your
family history and share with your health
care provider.
Some of the questions to ask include:

BI-RADS

BI-RADS

BI-RADS 1
Negative

Mammographic density

Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System
or BI-RADS is a standard system used to
describe mammogram findings and results. A
radiologist will categorize your mammogram
results using a numbered system of 0 through
6. Talk to your health care provider about your
mammogram results and what you need to do
next.

BI-RADS 1 means the test is negative for
cancer. This is a normal test result. Your
breasts look similar in the appearance of the
breast tissue on the mammogram. There are
no masses (lumps), distorted structures, or
suspicious calcifications. In this case, negative
means nothing new or abnormal was found.

BI-RADS 2

These same BI-RADS categories can also
be used to describe the results of a breast
ultrasound or breast MRI.

Benign (non-cancerous) finding
This is also a negative test result (there’s no
sign of cancer), but the radiologist chooses to
describe a finding that is not cancer, such as
benign calcifications, masses, or lymph nodes
in the breast that are clearly not cancer. This
can also be used to describe changes from a
prior procedure (such as a biopsy) or surgery
in the breast. This ensures that others who
look at the mammogram in the future will not
mistake the benign finding as suspicious.

BI-RADS also classifies breast density into
groups, which are described next. See Guide

1.

BI-RADS

BI-RADS 3

BI-RADS 5

Probably benign finding – Follow-up in a
short time frame is suggested

Highly suggestive of malignancy –
Appropriate action should be taken

A finding in this category has a very low (no
more than 2%) chance of being cancer. It is
not expected to change over time. But since
it’s not proven to be benign, breast experts
agree that it is very safe to see if the area in
question does change over time.

The findings look like cancer and have a high
chance (at least 95%) of being cancer. Biopsy
is very strongly recommended.

BI-RADS 6
Known biopsy-proven malignancy –
Appropriate action should be taken

You will likely need follow-up with repeat
imaging in 6 to 12 months and regularly after
that until the finding is known to be stable
(usually at least 2 years). This approach helps
avoid unnecessary biopsies, but if the area
does change over time, it still allows for early
diagnosis.

This category is used only for findings on
a mammogram (or ultrasound or MRI) that
have already been shown to be cancer by a
previous biopsy. Imaging may be used in this
way to see how well the cancer is responding
to treatment.

BI-RADS 4
Suspicious abnormality – Biopsy should be
considered
These findings do not definitely look like
cancer but could be cancer. The radiologist is
concerned enough to recommend a biopsy.
The findings in this category can have a wide
range of suspicion levels. For this reason, this
category is often divided further:


4A: Finding with a low likelihood of being
cancer (more than 2% but no more than
10%)



4B: Finding with a moderate likelihood
of being cancer (more than 10% but no
more than 50%)



4C: Finding with a high likelihood of being
cancer (more than 50% but less than
95%), but not as high as Category 5

family history of certain cancers like ovarian
and pancreatic cancer—not just breast cancer.
Other factors that put you at increased risk
include:



If you had a previous breast biopsy that
showed atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis, 2022



If you have a gene that predisposes
you to breast cancer such a BRCA1 or
BRCA2

There is no upper age limit for screening
mammograms. This means that screening
mammograms can continue throughout your
entire life unless you and your provider decide
otherwise based on your health.

What is risk?

If you had radiation therapy (RT) to the
chest between 10 and 30 years of age

Family history or genetic testing that
suggests a genetic predisposition to
breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer

A risk assessment is based on your age,
reproductive history (such as when your period
started, if you have given birth and the age at
which you first gave birth), and factors listed
above. Individuals should undergo breast
cancer risk assessment by 25 years of age.
Your HCP should share information regarding
potential benefits, risks, and limitations of
breast screening. Shared decision-making
between you and your HCP is encouraged.

See your health care provider (HCP) regularly
for checkups. You might be asked to see your
HCP more than every year based on your risk
factors for developing breast cancer. Know
your breasts and immediately report any
changes to your HCP. As your family health
history changes, keep your HCP updated. This
is important.

Risk assessment for screening

Average risk

Average risk

What is your risk level?

Average risk means you have no known
genetic or family history that suggests you
are at increased risk of developing breast
cancer. It is recommended you have annual
screening mammograms starting at 40
years of age. However, based on certain
risk factors or as your family health history
information changes, your HCP might
recommend you start annual screening
mammograms sooner. Annual means every
year. If you have questions or concerns, ask
your HCP.

Cancer risk is largely based on a family history of
cancer. The goal is to undergo a risk assessment
by 25 years of age. This will determine when you
should start annual screening mammograms. Your
risk for developing breast cancer will be rated as
average or increased risk.

Have you even been pregnant or given birth?
What was your age when you first gave birth?

•

How many biological relatives (parents,
brothers, sisters, children, aunts, uncles,
grandparents) on either side of your family
have breast cancer? Are there other cancers
such as ovarian, tubal, uterine, pancreatic, or
prostate cancers in the family? What is/was
the cancer stage or cancer cell type? At what

Testing during pregnancy and breastfeeding

Pregnancy-associated breast cancer
(PABC) is breast cancer that occurs
during pregnancy, while breastfeeding,
or within 1 year of delivery. It is
important to continue taking care of your
breast health during pregnancy and
breastfeeding. Contact your health care
provider about new or unusual changes
to your breasts.

although it can be safely used in lactating
women. Breast ultrasound and mammography
(with abdominal shielding) can be safely
performed during pregnancy. So, breast
screening, breast lumps, and other breast
problems are evaluated with mammogram and
ultrasound in a similar way during pregnancy
and breastfeeding as they are in non-pregnant
patients.
This section discusses screening
recommendations during pregnancy and
breastfeeding. It also provides information on
signs and symptoms that you should report to
your HCP.

Overview
Changes in the breast are normal during
pregnancy and breastfeeding (lactation).
However, these changes can make it harder
to detect small breast cancers. This is why it
is important to continue taking care of your
breast health. Delayed diagnosis of breast
cancer during pregnancy or breastfeeding
does happen. This may result in more
advanced disease, larger tumors, and a
greater likelihood of cancer in the lymph
nodes.

During pregnancy
Clinical breast exams and breast cancer
screening mammograms can and should
continue on a yearly basis during pregnancy.
Mammograms contain a very low level of
radiation and are considered safe during
pregnancy. Abdominal shielding should be
used to reduce radiation exposure to the fetus.

Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC)
is defined as breast cancer occurring during
pregnancy, while breastfeeding, or within one
year of delivery. While rare, PABC is the most
common invasive cancer diagnosed during
pregnancy.

Normal changes happen in the breast, skin,
and nipple during pregnancy. However, if you
notice anything new or unusual contact your
HCP. For changes in the skin or breast such
as persistent or focused pain, a lump, or nipple
discharge an ultrasound will be done.

See your health care provider (HCP) regularly
for checkups. Contact your HCP for any new
or worsening changes.
Breast cancer screening during pregnancy and
lactation is similar to non-pregnant and nonlactating women with some exceptions. For
example, due to safety concerns, breast MRI
is not generally performed during pregnancy,

Signs and symptoms
or concentrated in one area, you may have
an ultrasound. A mammogram might also be
done if you are 30 years of age or over and
you have not had a recent mammogram.
Depending on the test results, further testing
might be needed.

Lumps and other signs

If you have a symptom that can be felt
(palpable) such as a lump, mass, nodules, or
skin thickening, then

Signs and symptoms
A sign can be seen by someone else like your
health care provider (HCP). A symptom is
something only you can feel. If you have any
signs or symptoms that might suggest breast
cancer, another cancer or disease, you may
have more tests. These are called diagnostic
tests because they help diagnose a disease
or condition. It is important to tell your HCP if
something doesn’t feel or look right and has
been that way for a few days. Don’t wait to say
something!



For those under 30 years of age, an
ultrasound is preferred as a diagnostic
test. However, your doctor may wait and
observe any changes for 1 to 2 menstrual
cycles before ordering an ultrasound.



For those 30 years of age or over, a
diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound
are recommended.

For a benign finding, you may not need
any further evaluation. If the mammogram
or ultrasound show something, your HCP
may recommend a core needle biopsy,
additional physical exams, or more frequent
mammograms and/or ultrasounds to monitor
the symptom. You are also an important part
of monitoring and should let your HCP know if
you notice any new changes. If you have any
questions or concerns, talk with your HCP.

Breast implant-related symptoms

Those with breast implants have a very small
risk of developing breast implant-associated
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL),
a type of cancer. It is mostly seen in textured
implants about 7 to 9 years after implantation.
The main symptoms of BIA-ALCL are
persistent swelling, or a lump or pain in the
area of the breast implant. Since BIA-ALCL is
so rare, only those with symptoms will undergo
further testing.

Know your breasts
and immediately
report any changes
to your health care
provider.

If it has been more than 1 year since breast
implant surgery and you are having symptoms
related to the implants, then your health care
provider should consult with a multidisciplinary
team with experience in implant-related
problems. If BIA-ALCL is suspected, then you
will undergo further testing.

Possible inflammatory breast cancer

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare,
aggressive cancer where cancer cells block
lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. This
causes the breast to look red and swollen and
feel warm to the touch.

Skin changes
Skin changes include puckering, dimpling,
a rash, or redness of the skin of the breast.
Some people have a rash or redness of the
nipple and the surrounding skin. The skin
might look like an orange peel or the texture
might feel different.

Possible signs of IBC:

Some skin changes might be a sign of
inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) or Paget
disease. Since these diseases are difficult to
diagnose, you might be referred to a breast
specialist.

Those assigned male at birth
Those assigned male at birth do not undergo
routine screening mammograms. However,
males can develop breast cancer. A diagnostic
mammogram may be ordered if you have
extra breast tissue (gynecomastia). If you have
bloody nipple discharge or symptoms that can
be felt such as a lump, then an ultrasound
will be done in addition to the diagnostic
mammogram. A core needle biopsy might
also be done. Your condition will be monitored
and you might be asked to return to your HCP
for regular testing. Consider seeing a breast
specialist.

If you have abnormal nipple discharge without
other symptoms, then

Gynecomastia

Gynecomastia is the abnormal growth of
breast tissue in those assigned male at
birth. There might be concern if one breast
appears enlarged. This is called asymmetrical
gynecomastia. A diagnostic mammogram with
possible ultrasound will be done.

For those under 30 years of age, an
ultrasound will be done. A diagnostic
mammogram might also be done.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis, 2022

For those 30 years of age or over, a
diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound
will be done.

Depending on the BI-RADS result, you might
have a core need biopsy, additional physical
exams, more frequent mammograms and/or
ultrasounds to monitor the symptom. You might
be referred to a breast specialist and a breast
MRI might be done. If you have any questions
or concerns, talk with your health care provider

or main area of concern is biopsied first. Other
areas may also be biopsied.

A biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample
of tissue. The sample is sent to a lab for
testing. A pathologist will examine the biopsy
under the microscope to determine if the tissue
is benign (not cancer) or due to pre-cancer
or cancer. Biopsy results can be found in a
pathology report. Ask questions about your
biopsy results and what it means for next
steps.

Types of possible biopsies include:

Depending on the biopsy results, you may not
need any additional testing and be returned
to routine follow-up care. However, the biopsy
results may require additional testing or more
frequent exams or imaging. If cancer is found,
you will be referred for cancer treatment.



Aspiration or core biopsy (CB) uses
needles of different sizes guided by
imaging to remove a sample of tissue.



Excisional removes a small amount of
tissue through a cut in the skin or body
(surgery).

Before biopsies are performed, usually the
area is injected with numbing medicine. A core
needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one
tissue sample, but usually through the same
area on the breast. The samples are small.
The needle is often guided into the tumor with
imaging. When mammography is used during
a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle
biopsy.

There are different types of biopsies. Some
biopsies are guided using imaging, such as a
mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI. The primary

around the nipple.

duct
A tube-shaped structure through which milk
travels to the nipple.

atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)

of breast ducts and the cells look abnormal
under a microscope. Having atypical ductal
hyperplasia increases the risk of breast cancer.

Having atypical lobular hyperplasia increases
the risk of breast cancer.

edema
Swelling caused by excess fluid in body
tissues.
erythema
Reddening of the skin, usually in patches.

axillary lymph node (ALN)
A small disease-fighting structure that is near
the armpit.

breast.

nipple discharge
Fluid that is not milk coming from the nipple.
palpable adenopathy
Lymph nodes that feel abnormal in size or
consistency.

lobular neoplasia
A benign condition in which abnormal cells
are found in the lobules of the breast and
