About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Survivorship, Version 1.2024 — March 29, 2024.

Most NCCN Guidelines for Patients
focus on a type of cancer. They
often describe unique details about
surveillance and supportive care for
that cancer type.

•

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients for
Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer
address unique survivorship needs of
people ages 15 through 39 years.

•

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients
for Palliative Care address patient,
family, and caregiver needs for
comprehensive care during cancer
treatment as well as at the end of life.

This book is part of a two-part book
series on survivorship. Read the
other survivorship book to get help for
setting and achieving goals for healthy
living.

Who is a cancer survivor?
Cancer survivors are people living with cancer
and those free of cancer. Survivorship starts
at the time of cancer diagnosis and continues
through life.
Some people do not like or identify with the
term survivor. It is not meant to be a label.
Its purpose is to identify the community of
people with a history of cancer. Having a
common term is useful for improving the care
of survivors.

What is survivorship care?
Survivorship care improves health, wellness,
and quality of life. Its focus is on the wide and
lasting impact of cancer and its treatment. It
addresses physical and mental health, health
behaviors, professional and personal identity,
and finances, just to name a few.

When should survivorship
care start?

Standards of survivorship care include:








Routine testing for the return of a
cancer (surveillance) and new cancers
(screening)

Although survivorship care often begins
after initial treatment ends, many care
recommendations can be started during
treatment to prevent or lessen cancer-related
effects.

Routine testing for late and long-term
effects of cancer and treatment
Prevention of harmful effects of cancer
and treatment

Many effects of cancer treatment, such as
nausea and vomiting, quickly resolve after
treatment ends. On the other hand, some
effects don’t go away or only start after
treatment.

Management of cancer-related challenges
including referral to specialists



Coordinated care between providers



Planning for ongoing survivorship care



To plan survivorship care, your cancer or
primary care provider will assess your needs.
Ongoing care requires that you see one or
both providers at least once a year. They will
review your cancer care, health history, current
abilities, and medications.



Your providers may create and review a
survivorship plan with you. You will be given a
schedule of follow-up visits. Possible cancerrelated late effects may be included in the
plan. Your providers may refer you to other
specialists and community resources.

Long-term effects start during treatment
and persist after treatment is done.
Cognitive problems and fatigue can be
long-term effects.
Late effects occur long after treatment
has ended. Second cancers are late
effects.

This book can help you get care for late and
long-term effects. It is written for survivors with
an onset of cancer in adulthood. It explains
expert recommendations that are based on
the latest science and practices at top cancer
centers.
There are often many ways to get relief from
cancer-related effects. Sometimes, effects can
even be prevented. To get relief, there may be
self-management and coping skills to learn.
Professional care may include prescribed
drugs and non-drug treatment.
Discuss survivorship care with your health care
providers. In the last chapter, there is a list of
suggested questions to ask your providers.

Hereditary cancers

As a cancer survivor, you have an
increased risk of a second cancer

Some second cancers occur because they
are hereditary cancers. Hereditary cancer is
caused by abnormal genes that are passed
down from parents to children. Cancers that
can be hereditary include breast, ovarian,
colorectal, and prostate cancer.

forming. This chapter explains
testing for second cancers before
symptoms appear.

Your oncologist will assess if you are at risk
for hereditary cancers. The signs of hereditary
cancer include:

Causes of second cancers
A small number of cancer survivors develop
second cancers. These second cancers
develop years after treatment, when you may
not be seeing an oncologist anymore.




Second cancers are not the return of the
prior cancer. They are different. For example,
a survivor may get lung cancer after being
diagnosed with breast cancer. It is also
possible to develop a second cancer that is
the same type as a prior cancer. An example is
two primary breast cancers.





Some causes of the first cancer may be
related to getting a second cancer. These
causes include genetics passed down
from parents, family history, smoking,
some viral infections, and exposure to
cancer-causing agents.
Some cancer treatments may increase
cancer risk. Such treatments include
radiation therapy, certain chemotherapies,
and certain targeted therapies.

Diagnosis of rare cancers, multiple
primary cancers, or cancer related to a
high-risk cancer syndrome
Having blood relatives with the same or
related cancers

At health visits, update your health care
providers on any new cancers among your
blood relatives. Your provider may suggest
getting genetic testing. A blood sample is
needed. You may talk with a genetic counselor
to discuss your family’s cancer history.

Although few survivors get second cancers,
more survivors develop cancers than the
general public because of several reasons:

Screening for second
cancers

Screening vs. surveillance

Cancer screening is routine testing of cancer
or pre-cancer conditions. The aim is to detect
cancer at an early stage when treatment
works best. Ask your health care provider what
screening you need.

What’s the difference between screening
and surveillance? Both involve testing for
cancer but have different purposes.

Screening

General screening

Cancer screening is routine testing for a
new cancer or pre-cancer conditions. The
aim is to detect cancer at an early stage
when treatment works best.

There are cancer screening programs for the
general public. People start screening when
they have either an average or high risk of
cancer. The risk level that prompts screening
varies between cancers. There is standard
screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, lung,
prostate, and skin cancers.

Surveillance
Cancer that was thought to be cured
can reappear on tests. The return of
cancer is called a recurrence or relapse.
Survivorship care includes routine
checking for a recurrence. This is called
surveillance. Surveillance often includes
updating your health history and a
physical exam. Some survivors get blood
tests or imaging like x-rays or scans.

More information on screening for colorectal
and lung cancer is available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Treatment-related screening

screening, your provider will obtain your
health history and do a physical exam every
year. Common screening methods for second
cancers are:

Certain cancer treatments increase the
risk of a second cancer. Risk is based on
the type and intensity of the treatment.
Treatment-related second cancers are listed in

Preventing second cancers

Key points

Prevention of second (and recurring) cancers
is a key part of survivorship care. You can
reduce your risk of cancer with healthy living.
Healthy living includes physical activity, eating
well, sun protection, and not using tobacco.





Less often, medical treatments are used to
prevent cancer. For example, some people do
one or more of the following:






Have surgery to remove a body part, like
a breast, where cancer is likely to start.



Take medication that lowers hormone
levels to reduce the chance of getting
cancer.


Get the human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccine, which can be received up to 45
years of age.

More information on healthy living and
vaccinations is available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Survivorship Care for
Cancer-Related Late and Long-Term Effects, 2024

12

A small number of cancer survivors
develop a new cancer. The increased risk
for second cancers is due in part to some
causes of the first cancer and certain
cancer treatments.
Some cancers are hereditary which
means the risk was passed down from
parents. Your provider will assess if you’re
at risk for an inherited cancer.
Cancer survivors participate in general
cancer screening but may also get extra
screening. Extra screening is based on
prior cancer treatment and current signs
and symptoms of cancer.
Common methods of preventing second
cancers include lifestyle changes and
vaccines. Less often, survivors undergo
surgery or receive hormone-directed
drugs.



Sex hormones and cancer



Sex hormones play a key role in puberty,
having babies, and overall health. Levels of
sex hormones naturally vary between people
based on their sex organs and age. Cancer
treatment can cause drastic changes in sex
hormones.



If you have menstrual periods, your ovaries
make most of the main sex hormones, called
estrogen and progesterone, in your body.
Levels of these hormones quickly drop when
menstrual periods stop occurring.





Guide 2.

Menopausal symptoms and risks
The end of menstrual cycles caused by natural
aging or oophorectomy is called menopause.
Health care providers identify natural
menopause by an absence of menstrual
periods for at least 12 months. Menopausal
symptoms and risks can occur at these times:

Nearing or reaching the natural end of
menstrual periods caused by aging
Surgery, called oophorectomy, that
removes ovaries
Cancer drugs that stop the ovaries from
working while taking them

The slow, natural drop in androgens from
testicles does not have the same effect
as menopause. For example, the gradual
decrease does not cause hot flashes. The
sharp drop in androgens caused by cancer
treatment does cause symptoms and health
risks like those related to menopause.

Assessment of symptoms

Estrogen by itself may be used to treat
survivors whose uterus has been removed.
It is given with progestin when the uterus is
intact.

Your health care provider may ask about
symptoms related to changes in sex
hormones. If the symptoms cause problems,
your provider will do an assessment. The
cause of the symptoms will be confirmed. Be
ready to give an update on your health history
and medications. You may get blood tests of
sex hormones and a physical exam.

There are medicines without hormones
that reduce hot flashes. These medicines
include antidepressants, anticonvulsants,
blood pressure medicine, and muscle
relaxers. At low doses, antidepressants and
anticonvulsants treat hot flashes. Fezolinetant
(Veozah) is a new treatment for hot flashes but
needs to be tested among people with breast
cancer.

There is treatment for many hormone-related
symptoms:

problems, pain, and mental health.

Hot flashes may be reduced by methods other
than drugs. Acupuncture, yoga, and hypnosis
may help. Healthy living improves overall
health and may relieve hot flashes. Avoid
drinking alcohol if it is a trigger of hot flashes.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may help
reduce the impact of hot flashes.

Anemia and Neutropenia to learn about
the treatment of anemia.
The next sections in this chapter focus on
hot flashes, gynecomastia, and urogenital
problems.

You may be taking supplements for hot
flashes. However, some may interfere with
cancer treatment. Tell your provider about all
the medicines and supplements you take.

Treatment of hot flashes

Androgen-deprivation hot flashes

Hot flashes are a sudden feeling of warmth
in the upper body. During a hot flash, many
people sweat and their skin looks flushed.
The intensity of hot flashes can range from
mild to severe. Hot flashes are sometimes
called hot flushes, night sweats and vasomotor
symptoms. Treatment for hot flashes is listed
in Guide 3.

If you’re on androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT), a change in the prescription may help.
You may be able to take breaks from ADT
to relieve side effects like hot flashes. This
treatment approach is called intermittent ADT.
Hormones can be used to treat hot flashes
in some survivors. Medroxyprogesterone,
estrogen, and cyproterone acetate relieve
hot flashes caused by ADT. Androgens treat
hot flashes caused by treatment-damaged

There are several non-hormonal treatments
for hot flashes caused by low androgens.
Venlafaxine and gabapentin are drugs that

» Urogenital problems » Key points

Treatment of gynecomastia

Key points

Gynecomastia is an enlargement of breast
tissue that sometimes happens during ADT.
Breasts also enlarge because of aging and
certain health conditions.





There are 3 treatments for gynecomastia.
One option is radiation to the breasts before
they enlarge. Another option is a medication
called tamoxifen. Tamoxifen stops the action
of estrogen in breast tissue. The third option
is surgery that removes breast tissue. This
surgery is called reduction mammoplasty.



Treatment of urogenital
problems



Urogenital problems are a common
menopausal symptom. They are related to the
thinning of the vaginal or urinary tract wall.
Such problems include:


Urine leaks (incontinence)



Pain when urinating



Urinary tract infection (UTI)



Vaginal discomfort



Treatment options include estrogen or
testosterone applied to the vagina. Be aware
that vaginal hormones may not be safe for
survivors of estrogen-dependent cancers. You
may also be referred to a specialist for care.

A change in sex hormones may cause
unwanted symptoms. If these symptoms
are problematic, an assessment that may
include blood tests is needed.
Hot flashes are a sudden feeling of
warmth in the upper body. The intensity of
hot flashes can range from mild to severe.
Treatment of hot flashes with hormones
is safe for some survivors. There are
several other drug treatments that can
be used too. Some people get relief from
acupuncture, healthy living, and cognitive
behavioral therapy.
Enlarged breast tissue caused by low
androgens can be prevented with
radiation and treated with tamoxifen and
surgery.
Urogenital problems can be treated with
hormones applied to the vagina.

It takes teamwork to prevent heart disease.
This section explains what you and your
providers can do to keep your heart healthy.

Cancer treatments that may damage the heart

cancer treatments kill cancer cells as well as
healthy heart cells. Cancer treatments that
may cause heart problems include:

include your diet, how active you are,
smoking, and drinking alcohol.

Follow the ABCDE tool
The ABCDE tool can be used to decrease the
chance of heart disease. It lists important steps
to follow. An adapted ABCDE tool for cancer
survivors is listed in Guide 5.

Heart disease may start during or shortly
after cardiotoxic drug treatment.
Heart disease may occur years after
radiation therapy in the chest.

One of the first steps of heart wellness is
awareness. Learn what risk factors for heart
disease you have. You might be able to lower
your risk. Also, learn about the signs and
symptoms of heart disease. You’ll be able to
tell your providers if symptoms start or worsen.

Heart disease that is not related to cancer
treatment most often develops 5 or more
years after cancer diagnosis.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Survivorship Care for
Cancer-Related Late and Long-Term Effects, 2024

Health conditions that can be managed
are high blood pressure (hypertension),
high cholesterol, obesity, and high blood
sugar (diabetes).

Someone on your care team will monitor for
heart disease. Your primary care provider is
likely the one who will monitor you. They will
measure your weight, blood pressure, and
cholesterol on a regular basis. You will be
screened for diabetes. Be prepared to discuss
your exercise, eating, and tobacco habits.

Your care team will assess if you have or
are at risk for heart disease. Testing of
your heart with an echocardiogram (echo),
electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), or
both may be needed. An echocardiogram
detects structural changes in the heart.
An electrocardiogram detects abnormal
heartbeats.

Your health care providers will help you
reduce your risk of heart disease. They can
manage health conditions. They can give you
recommendations for healthy living.

Ask your care team if your cancer treatment
may damage your heart. Radiation near the
heart may be harmful. Certain chemotherapy
drugs, like anthracyclines, may also cause
heart damage. Heart damage from radiation
therapy or chemotherapy is related to the
dosage. Doses have been standardized to
treat cancer and limit heart damage.

Taking aspirin once a day may decrease the
risk of heart attack and stroke. Its benefits
vary between people. It may cause unwanted
effects. Ask your provider if you should take
aspirin to lower your chance of heart disease.

They will also assess your ability to do day-today activities.

Early heart failure screening
Heart failure is best managed when it is
identified early. If you have a high risk for
heart failure, get screened within 1 year after
anthracycline treatment. Risk is partly based
on which anthracycline was received and
the total dose. A high doxorubicin dose of
250 mg/m2 or above is more likely to be toxic.

Your care team must know your risk factors
for heart failure. You may get bloodwork and
heart tests. You’ll likely get an echocardiogram
(echo) if you had a high anthracycline dose,
have other risk factors, or have symptoms of
heart failure.

An assessment of heart failure includes a

team will keep checking for heart failure. Keep
in mind that heart failure may not show until
many years after cancer treatment.

Lymphedema is swelling of body tissue that
can be caused by some cancer treatments.
It can start any time after treatment but most
often occurs within 18 months. It can be a
short-term or chronic condition.

or fatigue in a limb, fullness or tightness in the
skin, or pain in the area.

There are 3 main stages of lymphedema.
Stage 0 is an early phase that has subtle or
no symptoms. The main stages with clear
symptoms are stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3.
Symptoms of lymphedema by stage are listed
in Guide 7.

As lymphedema advances, you may have a
decreased range of motion or function in a
limb. Your skin may thicken. Lymph buildup
can cause inflammation that leads to scar
tissue, infection, and fat deposits in the skin.

Swelling on the treated side of the body is the
key symptom of lymphedema. Swelling may
impact any part of the body. It can occur in
an arm or leg, the neck, trunk, or groin. Other
early symptoms include a feeling of heaviness

Guide 7
Symptoms of lymphedema by stage
Stage 0

No swelling but there may be subtle symptoms, such as:
• A heavy feeling in a limb
• Feeling of fatigue in a limb

Stage 1

• Swelling can be seen on the side of body that was treated
• Swelling in a limb is reduced with elevation
• An indent in the skin may occur when pressure is applied (called pitting)
• Area with lymphedema is larger, heavier, or stiffer

Stage 2

• The swollen area has a spongy texture
• Swelling in limb does not decrease with elevation
• An indent in the skin (pitting) is less visible as swelling increases
• Scar tissue may form making the swollen area larger and feel hard

Stage 3

• Swelling has further increased making the area larger
• Skin of swollen area is severely dry, scaly, or thickened
• In the limbs, fluid leakage and blisters are common
• Moving limbs or turning your neck may be limited
• Skin of swollen area may have fungal infections or benign tumors

Early detection is important

Tests for lymphedema
To confirm that you have lymphedema, your
care team must rule out other causes, such as
cancer, infection, and a blood clot. You then
may be referred to a certified lymphedema
therapist. This therapist may be a physician,
an occupational therapist, or a physical
therapist.

Finding lymphedema early is key to achieving
the best outcomes. Stage 0 and stage 1
lymphedema may be reversed with treatment.

Screening for lymphedema
Your provider will screen for lymphedema
if you are at risk. Risk is based on what
treatment you had. It is also based on body
mass index (BMI), skin infections, number of
removed lymph nodes, and extent of cancer
before treatment. Ask your care team what
your risk is.

The therapist may measure your limb. If not
measured before treatment, the swollen limb
can be compared to the normal limb. You may
need to do stretches to check your range of
motion. Some people need imaging of the
lymph system called lymphoscintigraphy.

As part of screening, your care team will ask
about symptoms at health visits. Look for
symptoms on the treated side of your body:

Stay flexible
Lymphedema can restrict your range of

rehabilitation specialist for help. Your provider
will teach you gentle stretching and rangeof-motion exercises. These movements may
push the lymph to another area.

Get a massage
Manual lymphatic drainage is a type of
massage. The massage moves fluid from the
swollen area to where the lymph system is
working. There is also a simple form of selfmassage. Your provider will assess if manual
lymphatic drainage is safe for you.

Take precautions with medical
procedures

Move more
Movement—especially exercise—lowers the
risk of lymphedema. It does not trigger or
worsen lymphedema. However, you should
avoid exercising if you have a new injury or
infection in the affected area.

Early research suggests that air travel,
venipuncture, and blood pressure
measurement don’t trigger lymphedema.
But more research is needed to prove these
results. Until there are better data, get medical
procedures on the limb that is not at risk for
lymphedema. If needed, procedures may be
done on the at-risk limb.

Strength training may reduce symptoms of
lymphedema. Slowly increase the size of
weights or strength of resistance bands.
Compression garments may be needed during
training.

Referral for surgery
Surgery may be helpful for some people. It can
reroute your lymph vessels so that they bypass
the blocked area.

Water exercise may also relieve symptoms.
Before starting, get your skin checked for cuts
and cracking.
Consult with an expert before starting
exercise. A lymphedema therapist or a pain
expert, called a physiatrist, is recommended.

What is sexual dysfunction?
Sexual dysfunction is an ongoing problem with
desire or the ability to respond with arousal,
orgasm, or satisfaction. It often causes distress
and discontent with sexual activity.

Radiation therapy and surgery in the
pelvis may damage sex organs.
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and
endocrine therapy affect sexual activity
by reducing sex hormone levels. Low
levels are also caused by certain types
of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and
immunotherapy.

Many cancer survivors do not feel well during
and after cancer care. High levels of distress,
pain, sleepiness, or fatigue reduce sexual
desire and arousal. After a cancer diagnosis,
mental health and relationships may decline
and impact sexual functioning. Sometimes,
survivors avoid sexual activity because they do
not like how cancer altered their body.

Female sexual dysfunction
Female sexual dysfunction occurs in people
with a vagina, uterus, ovaries, or clitoris. It
includes low desire for sexual activity. Vaginal

Low sex drive
If your sex drive is low, talk with your provider
about medications. Androgens, flibanserin,

Lubricants also prevent painful sex but may
irritate the area. More research is needed on
vaginal moisturizers, vaginal gels, hyaluronic
acid, and oils.

Problems with orgasm
Stimulation devices, like a vibrator, can help
people have better orgasms. Pelvic physical
therapy improves orgasms by strengthening
muscles involved in orgasms.

Pain during sex
Treatment for vaginal dryness may also help
prevent pain during sex. Ospemifene is a
non-hormonal medicine that helps improve
the tissue lining of the vagina. It may reduce
pain. Pain may be prevented with anesthetics
applied to the vulva before sex.
Devices improve sexual function. A dilator is a
tube-shaped device that stretches the vagina.
It is used to prevent painful sex. More research
is needed, but dilators may prevent narrowing
of the vagina after pelvic radiation.

Pelvic physical therapy
Pelvic physical therapy can
reduce female and male sexual
dysfunction. It strengthens
weak pelvic muscles. Your
physical therapist will teach you
strengthening exercises and
may use biofeedback to check
your results.

Male sexual dysfunction has been the subject
of research for decades. There are many good
treatments. Mental causes of male sexual
dysfunction can be treated with one-on-one or
couples counseling or psychiatric medicines.
Treatments for physical causes of male sexual
dysfunction are listed in Guide 11.

Certain cancer treatments can reduce the level

Taking testosterone may improve erections but
may not be safe for people with heart disease.
Healthy living can improve sexual function in

affected by overweight. Move more and
exercise. Don’t drink a lot of alcohol. Good
heart health is also good sexual health.

Erectile dysfunction
PDE5 inhibitors are medicines that improve

Pelvic physical therapy strengthens weak
pelvic floor muscles. It may help improve
erections.



Ejaculation problems
Medicines called antidepressants often
cause sexual dysfunction. But a group of
antidepressants called SSRIs prevents
premature ejaculation. And another
antidepressant called clomipramine extends
pleasure by delaying ejaculation.







Testosterone may be an option. Since it can
affect conception, tell your provider if you're
interested in having a baby.
Pelvic physical therapy may treat problems
with ejaculation including urine leaks. Leaking
may be lessened if you empty your bladder
before sexual activity. Leaked urine can be
captured in a worn condom.



Problems with orgasm
PDE5 inhibitors, testosterone, and pelvic
physical therapy improve orgasms.
Cabergoline also improves orgasms by
reducing the amount of prolactin in the body.
Use a vibrator to stimulate your body. It might
help you have an orgasm.

Low sex drive
The treatment for low sex drive is testosterone.
You may be referred to a specialist for
additional help.

Sexual dysfunction is an ongoing problem
with sex drive or the body’s response of
arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction. Many
cancer survivors have sexual dysfunction.
Surveys help pinpoint the type and
severity of sexual dysfunction.
You may be referred to one or more
specialists who help people with sexual
dysfunction.
More research is needed for treatment
of female sexual dysfunction. Hormones
may not be safe for survivors of hormonedependent cancers. Lubricants and other
topical drugs treat vaginal dryness and
pain. Devices and physical therapy can
lessen pain and increase orgasms.
There are several good treatments for
male sexual dysfunction. Testosterone
may help sexual dysfunction caused
by damaged testes. PDE5 inhibitors
improve erections and orgasms, and
some antidepressants stop premature
ejaculation. Other kinds of treatments are
vibrators, physical therapy, and healthy
living.

Cancer can happen to anyone. Even people
in their first decades of life get cancer. The
impact of early cancer can be life changing.
Cancer and its treatment may affect your
ability to have children.

endocrine therapy, and certain types of
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and

Fertility preservation is about keeping your
options open, whether you know or are
unsure about having children later. You may
be referred to a fertility specialist. A fertility
specialist can explain fertility preservation
options, including how procedures are done,
the success rates, timing, and costs.

Male fertility organs include the penis,
testicles, and prostate.
Female fertility organs include the vagina,
uterus, and ovaries.

What impairs fertility?

Tell your team what your goals for preserving
fertility are. You might need to act before
cancer treatment starts. Fertility preservation
works best if done before cancer treatment.

Cancer may impair fertility, but more often,
cancer treatment is the cause of impaired
fertility. For some people, impaired fertility is
permanent but for others, it can be reversed.

Talk to your cancer care team if there’s a
chance that you’ll want children one day. Your
team will explain if your fertility is at risk, and
if so, how high of a risk. If your treatment
plan changes, ask about the effects of new
treatments.

Fertility is the body’s ability to conceive a

Sleep is essential for living.

In general, adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep a
night. Quality of sleep is important, too. Good
sleep includes falling asleep easily, staying
asleep, and having restful sleep.

Problems with sleep can greatly
impact life. This chapter explains
the treatments for sleep problems.

Everyone sleeps poorly from time to time. In
contrast, sleep-wake disorders are ongoing
problems with sleep or daytime sleepiness.
The symptoms are distressing or cause a
loss of ability. Some causes of sleep-wake
disorders are health conditions, medications,
and poor sleep habits. Common types of
sleep-wake disorders are listed in Guide 14.

Sleep-wake disorders
Sleep is needed for good health and wellbeing. It recharges your body and mind. It
helps your body to fight disease.

Guide 14
Common types of sleep-wake disorders
Circadian rhythm
sleep-wake disorder

A mismatch between sleep-wake cycles and day-night cycles.

Hypersomnia

Excessive sleepiness during the day despite getting enough sleep.

Insomnia

An inability to fall asleep, stay asleep, or get restful sleep.

Insufficient
sleep syndrome

A chronic lack of sleep due to unhealthy sleep habits.

Narcolepsy

An impaired ability of the brain to control states of sleep
and wakefulness.

Obstructive sleep apnea

Pauses in breathing during sleep due to blocked airflow.

Restless legs syndrome

An intense urge to move the legs that worsens during rest and is
partly relieved by movement. Also called Willis-Ekbom disease.

also need to include if you woke up during the
night and for how long. Diaries also capture
daytime naps. Your provider will ask about any
strategies you use to fall or stay asleep.

Many cancer survivors have sleep problems.
Sleep problems may be due to more than
one reason. They can be due to changes in
the body. They can also be caused by certain
actions, such as drinking caffeine at bedtime.

Sleep study

After cancer treatment, sleep problems can
persist. They can persist due to long-term
treatment effects, medications, and mental
health. They can also persist because of poor
sleep patterns that started during treatment.
You may spend a lot of time in bed, sleep
during the day, or have an irregular bedtime
and waketime.

A sleep study is sometimes needed
to measure sleep. It is also called
polysomnography. It detects sleep-wake
disorders like sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and
restless legs syndrome (RLS). A full sleep
study is often done at a sleep center. Some
studies for sleep apnea can be done at home
with a portable device.

Testing and referral

Referral
Your oncologist may refer you to another
provider. You may see a sleep specialist or
your primary care provider for treatment. A
sleep specialist is especially helpful for these
sleep issues if they last at least 3 months:

Your health care provider may screen for sleep
problems on a regular basis. A brief survey is
used for screening. An in-depth assessment
is needed if you may have a sleep-wake
disorder.

•

In-depth assessment
An assessment includes a health history and
an exam of your body. You may also complete
brief surveys about distress, hot flashes, pain,
and fatigue. Your provider will order blood
tests if you may have low red blood cell counts
(anemia) or hormone levels (hypothyroidism).
You may see a sleep expert for further
evaluation.

It is common to complete a sleep diary or wear
a tracking device. These tools are helpful for
assessing sleep patterns. In the diary, you will
record your bedtime, time you fell asleep, and
the time you got up for the day. Your diary will

How to sleep better

Central nervous depressants are used to
treat insomnia. These medicines include
daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant.

Treatment of sleep-wake disorders often has
very good results. Your provider will treat
health conditions that are related to sleepwake disorders. Such conditions include pain,
obesity, anemia, heart disease, and hormone
problems. Your medications will be adjusted if
they affect your sleep. Specific treatments for
sleep problems are listed on the next page in
Guide 15.

Medicines called sedatives are used “off-label”
to treat insomnia. They aren’t approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
this use. Sedatives include antidepressants,
antihistamines, atypical anti-psychotics, and
melatonin. NCCN experts do not recommend
sedatives for routine use due to a lack of data.
Gabapentin enacarbil and dopamine agonists
are FDA approved and are preferred initial
treatments for RLS. Other medications for
RLS are opioids and clonazepam. Take iron
supplements if you have low iron. Iron can
improve symptoms.

Sleep hygiene
Sleep hygiene is a set of healthy sleep habits.
These habits will help you fall and stay asleep.
They include physical activity, daytime light
exposure, and regular sleep patterns. Sleep
hygiene should not be used alone to treat
sleep problems. It should be used with other
treatments. Sleep hygiene can help treat many
types of sleep-wake disorders.

CPAP machine
The most common treatment for sleepdisordered breathing is a CPAP machine.
CPAP is short for continuous positive airway
pressure. The machine keeps airways open
with forced air. Weight loss and physical
activity may also help people with sleepdisordered breathing.

CBT-I
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
(CBT-I) is the preferred treatment for insomnia.
It is a structured program that has very good
results. Its methods include stimulus control,
sleep restriction, cognitive therapy, relaxation,
and sleep hygiene.

Medicines
Medicines called hypnotics are used to treat
insomnia. They are also called sleep aids
and sleeping pills. They should be used
with caution. Hypnotics may make you do
activities while sleeping, such as sleep-driving
and sleep-eating. There is a risk of abusing
hypnotics. Some hypnotics may cause drug
dependence and withdrawal.

Management of pain is often done with
multiple methods. For example, your
management plan could include a painkiller
and physical activity. Pain is distressing, so
psychological support is a common part of the
management plan.

An in-depth assessment is needed for pain
related to cancer. Your provider will ask you
to complete a pain rating scale. Rating scales
help pinpoint the intensity and type of pain.
To plan pain management, your provider will
identify the causes and physical pathways of
the pain. If the pain is new, it may be due to
the cancer returning or worsening. You may
have to have tests for cancer.

Referral to specialists
Based on an assessment and follow-up visits,
you may be referred to other providers. If you
have pain not caused by cancer, your primary
care provider may take the lead in providing
pain management. For cancer-related pain,
your cancer care provider may refer you to one
of these specialists:

If the pain is chronic, a specific pain
syndrome should be identified if possible.
Pain management will be based on the
type of syndrome. Share your goals for pain
management, such as the level of comfort you
want.

An adjuvant analgesic can be the main
treatment of pain. When taken with opioids,
it may further reduce pain and allow a lower
dose of opioids to be used.

Safe opioid use
Addiction to prescribed opioids can
happen. But you and your provider can
take preventive steps.

Opioid medicine
Opioid medicine is sometimes necessary. It
is an option for moderate to severe pain. If
you have completed cancer treatment, opioid
medicine is not typically the first choice.

Your provider can create a safe
management plan:

3 Clearly discuss treatment goals,

Opioids relieve pain by affecting opioid
receptors on nerve cells. A dual-action opioid
that affects opioid and noradrenaline receptors
is an option for neuropathic pain.

Muscle relaxers are an option for arthralgias,
myalgias, and some types of bone pain.

3 Store opioids safetly
3 Use medication diaries and pill

3 Agree to urine testing
3 Safely discard unused opioids

Antiresorptive medicine
Your bones are living organs. New bone
replaces the old bone all the time. Bone
resorption is the breakdown and removal of
old bone. Antiresorptive medicines slow down
bone resorption and help keep bones strong.
Bisphosphonates are a type of antiresorptive

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on
changing negative thoughts and learning how
to relax. Other treatments include meditation,
skills training, and supportive-expressive
therapy. Hypnosis may help to relieve
neuropathic pain.

Phenol and alcohol blocks may reduce
pain from a pinched nerve (neuroma).
An intercostal nerve block may reduce
pain caused by post-mastectomy or postthoracotomy syndrome.
A medial branch block may reduce pain
caused by spinal compression.

Physical therapy and activity

Two other types of injections are used for
cancer pain:

It is often helpful to be physically active even
when in pain. Physical activity can increase
mobility and strengthen muscles. It has
good results for aromatase inhibitor-induced
arthralgia. But acute vertebral compression
may require short-term bedrest before starting
weight-bearing exercise.

Trigger point injections relieve pain from
muscle knots caused by post-radical neck
dissection syndrome.
Botox injections are known to reduce
wrinkles but are also used for muscle pain
relief caused by post-mastectomy or postthoracotomy syndrome and post-radical
neck dissection syndrome.

Physical therapy teaches you how to do
activities with less pain and increases flexibility
and strength. It will help you perform your
day-to-day routines, such as bathing. Aquatic
therapy consists of exercises that are done in
water.

Topical pain relief
Some pain medicines can be applied to the
skin where you feel pain. Pain patches stick to
the skin like a sticker. Pain creams, gels, and
ointments are rubbed on the skin.

Types of mental health
issues
What are mental disorders?

Cancer often takes a toll on mental health
because of its many challenges. Cancer
affects your body but may also affect your
relationships, work, and finances, just to name
a few. The challenges usually don’t stop at the
end of treatment.

Mental disorders are health conditions just
like heart disease is a health condition. There
are many types of mental disorders. Each
one is defined by a group of symptoms that
are related to major problems with emotion,
thinking, or behavior. The most common
among cancer survivors are anxiety and
depressive disorders.

This section describes 2 types of mental health
issues. These types are often experienced by
cancer survivors as well as their caregivers
and family members.



What is distress?


Distress includes common feelings like
sadness, worry, and anger but is much
broader. It is defined as an unpleasant
experience of a mental, physical, social, or
spiritual nature. Distress can affect the way
you think, feel, or act.

Symptoms of depression include feeling
down or irritable and losing interest in
things that you used to like.

Distress and mental disorders are sometimes
connected. Distress can lead to or worsen
mental disorders. And mental disorders can
cause distress.

Distress is very common among cancer
survivors. It ranges from mild to severe levels.
Mild distress is to be expected and may reduce
quality of life. An example is a normal fear of
cancer recurrence. Severe distress can affect
a person’s self-care, social life, mood, or faith.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Survivorship Care for
Cancer-Related Late and Long-Term Effects, 2024

Symptoms of anxiety include severe
fear or worry, panic attacks, and strong
behavioral impulses.

How mental health is
assessed

In-depth assessment
If the mental health screener indicates
you need help, your provider will ask more
questions. It’s important to understand the
types and causes of mental issues and to rule
out other health conditions. You will be asked
about a range of topics.

Your cancer or primary care provider should
screen for distress or mental disorders. A
screening tool consists of a brief scale or
short survey. After assessing your needs,
your health care providers can address your
concerns.



Routine screening



NCCN experts recommend routine screening
for distress and mental disorders. Ongoing
screening is important. Mental health issues
can start any time after a cancer diagnosis.
And they can persist for many years.





Your caregivers and family members may
be screened too. They may be distressed at
different times and for different reasons than
you.





Although distress can occur at any time, there
are times when distress is more likely. Distress
is likely during routine health care visits, when
getting health tests, or when symptoms occur.
Screening for mental disorders is also very
important at these times.
Your provider may not know you’re struggling
unless you very clearly say so. Let them know
how you feel. Once your provider knows your
situation, they can help.

Medical conditions
Medical conditions can cause or add to
mental health issues. Such conditions include
pain, hormone changes, and heart disease.
Your provider will identify and treat medical
conditions.

Your provider will use mental health screenings
and assessments to guide care. Cancer and
primary care providers will treat some mental
health issues and ensure your safety. For
needs beyond their care, they will refer you to
a specialist. Recommended steps to address
mental health are listed in Guide 19.

Healthy living
Healthy living can improve mental health. Work
with your provider to make a plan of physical
activity and healthy eating. Information on
goals for heathy living is available at NCCN.
org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Education
Your care team can provide education on
cancer and mental health. It’s important to
know that feeling distressed is normal. Every
cancer survivor is distressed at some point.
Learning about cancer can help prevent high
levels of uncertainty and stress. If you become
anxious or depressed, these conditions can be
treated.

Mental health medication

You may need help from a specialist.
Specialists include chaplains, social workers,
psychologists, psychiatrists, and advanced
practice clinicians.

Your provider may prescribe medications
for mental disorders. Antidepressants treat
depression and anxiety. They also help treat
pain and hot flashes.



It may take 2 to 6 weeks for antidepressants
to work. Your provider may prescribe a
benzodiazepine until an antidepressant starts
working. Benzodiazepines treat anxiety.





Medication can cause unwanted effects. Tell
your provider about any new or worsening
symptoms. Abruptly stopping antidepressants
or other medications may cause withdrawal.
When a medication is no longer needed, your
provider will slowly reduce the dose.



Social workers can help with practical and
psychosocial issues.
Mental health providers can diagnose and
provide treatment for mental disorders.
Addiction medicine specialists treat
problems with alcohol and drugs.

Key points

Safety plan



Sometimes, cancer survivors become a
danger to themselves or others. Your care
provider will assess your level of distress and
resources. If you have a plan to do harm, your
weapons will be secured, you will be watched,
and emergency services will be contacted. If
you have thoughts of death but no plans to
hurt yourself, you will be referred for mental
health services. You must agree to call 911 or
go the emergency department if you feel close
to doing harm.





Resources and referrals
Your provider or a patient navigator can put
you in touch with local resources. Based on
your needs, you may need help with practical
problems, such as housing and food. You may
benefit from educational and support groups.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Survivorship Care for
Cancer-Related Late and Long-Term Effects, 2024

Chaplains can help you with religious or
spiritual concerns.



72

Many survivors have mental health
issues. It is normal to be distressed.
Distress can lead to or worsen mental
disorders.
Your cancer or primary care provider
may do a quick screening of your mental
health. If no screening is done, tell your
provider how you feel. Distress is not
always obvious.
There are many ways that your provider
can help improve your mental health.
Education to learn what is normal and
what to expect can reduce stress.
Reducing symptoms and improving
physical health helps too.
You might need to see a specialist. Your
provider can make a referral.

Challenges to working
The following challenges can be encountered
as a cancer survivor in the workplace:

Why return to work?
As a cancer survivor, work can be important
for your social and emotional well-being. It can
bring a sense of normalcy and improve quality
of life. It can serve as a distraction from the
cancer.
In the United States, the workplace may be
the source of your health insurance coverage.
You may also need a regular paycheck. This
makes work even more important so that you
can afford future treatment and testing.

Symptoms affecting work



Employment discrimination



Limited flexibility in schedule or tasks

It is normal to want to get help as soon as
possible. While mental health should not be
ignored, there is time to have another provider
suggest a treatment plan. This is called
getting a second opinion, and it’s a normal
part of medical care. Even doctors get second
opinions!

This choice starts with having a
candid conversation with your
care team.

It’s your choice

Things you can do to prepare:

In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your team.

Care decisions are very personal. What is
important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:



Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions.
There may be out-of-pocket costs to
see providers who are not part of your
insurance plan.
Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the provider you will see
for your second opinion.
