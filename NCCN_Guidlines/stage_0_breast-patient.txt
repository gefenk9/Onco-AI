About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Breast Cancer Version 1.2024 – January 25, 2024.

The breast is an organ and a gland found
on the chest. The breast is made of milk
ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels,
ligaments, and other connective tissue. Behind
the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and
ribs. Muscle and ligaments help hold the
breast in place.

0 or noninvasive cancer. This
means the cancerous cells are in

outside the ducts. DCIS is treated

Breast tissue contains glands that can make
milk. These milk glands are called lobules.
Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small
tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the
nipple.

to prevent invasive breast cancer,
a more advanced form of cancer.

The ring of darker breast skin is called the
areola. The raised tip within the areola is called
the nipple. The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is
a term that refers to both parts.

The breast
The breast is a
glandular organ made
up of milk ducts,
fat, nerves, blood

1 Breast cancer basics » Ductal carcinoma in situ

Lymph fluid drains from breast tissue into
lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near
your armpit (axilla). Lymphatic fluid is a clear
fluid that gives cells water and food. It also
helps to fight germs. Nodes near the armpit
are called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs).

cancer is breast cancer that has spread from
the milk ducts or milk glands (lobules) into the
surrounding breast tissue or nearby lymph
nodes. Once outside the ducts or lobules,
breast cancer can spread through lymph or
blood to lymph nodes or other parts of the
body.

Ductal carcinoma in situ

Anyone can develop breast cancer, including
those assigned male at birth. Although there
are some differences between those assigned
male and those assigned female at birth,
treatment is very similar for all genders.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or intraductal
carcinoma is found in the cells that line the
ducts. Ducts are thin tubes that carry milk
in the breast. DCIS is noninvasive cancer.
Noninvasive means the cancerous cells are in
place (in situ) and have not spread anywhere
else.
DCIS is a preinvasive disease. DCIS is treated
to prevent invasive breast cancer, a more
advanced form of cancer. Invasive breast

DCIS
Ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) is found in the cells
that line the thin tubes
(ducts) that carry milk to
the breast. The cancerous

What’s the difference
between a screening and
diagnostic mammogram?

Anyone can develop breast cancer.
Inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat,
blood and lymph vessels, ligaments,
and connective tissue. Lobules are
structures that make breast milk. Ducts
carry breast milk from the lobules to the
nipple.

A mammogram is a picture of the inside of
your breast made using x-rays. During a
mammogram, the breast is pressed between
two plates while you stand in different
positions. Multiple x-rays will be taken. A
computer combines the x-rays to make
detailed pictures.

Breast cancer often starts in the ducts
or lobules and then spreads into the
surrounding tissue.
Cancerous cells found only inside the
ducts or lobules is called noninvasive.
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is found
only in the ducts.
Invasive breast cancer is cancer that
has grown outside the ducts or lobules
into surrounding tissue. Once outside
the ducts or lobules, breast cancer can
spread through lymph or blood to lymph
nodes or other parts of the body.

•

Screening mammograms are done on a
regular basis when there are no signs or
symptoms of breast cancer. Results take
a few days.

•

Diagnostic mammograms are used for
those who have symptoms such as a
lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge,
or whose breasts have changed shape or
size.

•

Diagnostic mammograms are also used
to take a closer look at an abnormal area
found in a screening mammogram.

•

A radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic
mammogram while you wait so if
additional testing is needed, it can be
done right away.

•

Both types of mammograms use lowdose x-rays to examine the breast.
They may use either the standard
2-dimensional (2D) digital mammogram or
3-dimensional (3D) mammogram known
as tomosynthesis.

Treatment planning starts with



testing. This chapter presents an
overview of the tests you might
receive and what to expect.

Test results



Results from biopsy and imaging studies will
be used to determine your treatment plan.
Treatment will be based on these findings. It
is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions and keep copies of your
test results.



Keep these things in mind:










Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.
They are great partners in your care.
In your contact list, include information on
the exact type of cancer you have, as well
as any treatments you've received and
the date each treatment started.
Set up a MyChart or health record
account if it’s available, which can
help you track your appointments and
communicate with your care team.

For possible tests, see Guide 1.

Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.
Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.

Physical exam

Medical history

During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
(OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you
take. Some supplements interact and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat



Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your care team will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history. Ask family members on both
sides of your family about their health issues
like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes,
and at what age they were diagnosed. It’s
important to know the specific type of cancer
or where the cancer started, if it is in multiple
locations, and if they had genetic testing.



Family history

Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.
Examine your breasts to look for lumps,
nipple discharge or bleeding, or skin
changes.
Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

Clinical breast exam
Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam
of the bare breast performed by a health care
provider to check for lumps or other changes.
It is done while you are seated and/or lying
down. Your provider should take time to
palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the
armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in
the room during the exam.

2 Testing for DCIS » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This
is important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Imaging tests show the primary
tumor, or where the cancer started, and look
for cancer in other parts of the body.

Contrast-enhanced mammogram
Contrast-enhanced mammography is a new
technology that uses contrast material to
improve the pictures of the inside of the breast.
It is sometimes used for those who cannot
have a MRI scan.

A radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report to
your doctor. It is likely that the report will be sent
directly to you through your patient portal or
patient access system. Your care team should
discuss these results you.

Breast MRI
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use radiation. If needed, an MRI would be
used in addition to a mammogram. Because
of the very strong magnets used in the MRI
machine, tell the technologist if you have any
metal in your body.

Diagnostic mammogram
A mammogram is a picture of the inside of
your breast. The picture is made using x-rays.
A computer combines the x-rays to make
detailed pictures. Mammogram results are
used to plan treatment.
Diagnostic mammograms look at specific areas
of your breasts, which may not be clearly seen
on screening mammograms. They are used
to see tumor and the size of the tumor(s).
Diagnostic mammograms include extra
compression in certain areas of the breast,
magnification views, or rolling the breast to
image additional areas of the breast. Other
diagnostic tests may include a breast MRI or
ultrasound (US).

For a breast MRI, a gadolinium-based contrast
agent (GBCA)—a rare, heavy metal—is used
to enhance the quality of the MRI. There are no
harmful effects from GBCA, but it may linger in
the body for months to years afterward. Talk to
your doctor if you have any concerns.

Ultrasound
An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer) will
be held and moved on your bare breast using
gel. It may also be placed below your armpit.
Ultrasound does not use x-rays. It is good at
showing small areas of cancer that are near
the skin. Sometimes, a breast ultrasound or
MRI is used to guide a biopsy.

Contrast material
Contrast materials are not dyes, but
substances that help make the pictures of the
inside of the body clearer. The contrast is not
permanent and will leave the body in your
urine after the test. There is more than one
type of contrast and it differs depending on
the test. Tell your care team if you have had

2 Testing for DCIS » Biopsy

Biopsy

Types of possible biopsies include:

A biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample
of tissue or fluid. The sample is sent to a lab
for testing. A pathologist will examine the
biopsy for cancer and write a report called a
pathology report. Ask questions about your
biopsy results and what they mean for your
treatment.





There are different types of biopsies. Some
biopsies are guided using imaging, such as
mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI. The primary
or main tumor is biopsied first. Other tumors or
tumors in different areas may also be biopsied.
You may have tissue removed from the breast,
lymph nodes, or both.



Standard of care is the
best-known way to treat a
particular disease based on
past clinical trials. There may
be more than one treatment
regimen that is considered
standard of care. Ask your
care team what treatment
options are available and if a
clinical trial might be right for
you.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, 2024

12

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or
core biopsy (CB) uses needles of
different sizes to remove a sample of
tissue or fluid. In a vacuum-assisted core
biopsy (VACB), suction is used through
a needle to remove the sample using a
special vacuum device.
Incisional biopsy removes a small
amount of tissue through a small cut in
the skin or body.
Excisional biopsy removes the entire
abnormal area. This is not the preferred
type of biopsy but may be necessary
if other methods are not possible or
when the biopsy results don’t match the
expected findings. This is usually done
under anesthesia in an operating room.

2 Testing for DCIS » Biopsy

Before biopsies are performed, usually the
area is injected with numbing medicine. A core
needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one
tissue sample, but usually through the same
area on the breast. The samples are small.
The needle is often guided into the tumor with
imaging. When mammography is used during
a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle
biopsy.

There are both physical and emotional
experiences in having biopsies. You may need
to rest and place an ice pack on the biopsy
area after the procedure. If you are working
or have other commitments, you may want to
take the day off to rest.

Biopsy results
Histology is the study of the anatomy
(structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under
a microscope. It is used to make treatment
decisions. Your pathology report will contain
information about histology.

One or more clips may be placed near the
breast tumor during a biopsy. The clips are
small, painless, and made of metal. They will
mark the site for future treatment and imaging.
The clips stay in place until surgery. If the area
biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place
to mark the biopsy site on future imaging. The
clips cause no problems, even if they are left
in place for a long time. You will be able to go
through airport security and have an MRI with
the clip(s) in place.

You may be recommended to have an open
biopsy (surgery) to remove (excise) the tumor
to confirm histology. Talk to your health care
provider for more information on next steps.

Biopsy
In a biopsy, a sample
of tumor is removed.
There are different
types of biopsy. This

2 Testing for DCIS » Estrogen receptor status

Estrogen receptor status
HER2 testing is not used in the
diagnosis and treatment of DCIS.

Estrogen is a hormone that plays a role in
breast development. A hormone is a substance
made by a gland in your body. Your blood
carries hormones throughout your body.
A receptor is a protein found inside or on
the surface of a cell. Substances such as
hormones attach (bind) to these receptors.
This causes changes within the cell.

Estrogen receptor-positive

Hormones recognize and bind to specific
hormone receptors. When hormones, such
as estrogen, attach to receptors inside breast
cancer cells, they can cause cancer to grow.
If found, these estrogen receptors may be
targeted for treatment using endocrine therapy.

In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast
cancer, IHC finds estrogen hormone receptors
in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells.
ER+ cancer cells may need estrogen to
grow. These cells may stop growing or die
with endocrine treatment to block estrogen
production or estrogen receptor signaling.

Immunohistochemistry

Estrogen receptor-negative

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to cells. These cells are
then studied using a microscope. IHC can
find estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells.
A pathologist will measure how many cells
have estrogen receptors and the number
of estrogen receptors inside each cell. Test
results will either be estrogen receptor-positive
(ER+) or estrogen receptor-negative (ER-).

Estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast
cancer cells do not have estrogen hormone
receptors. These cancer cells do not need
estrogen to grow and continue to grow.
Therefore, estrogen-blocking treatment is not
effective.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, 2024

2 Testing for DCIS » Genetic cancer risk testing

Genetic cancer risk testing

What is your family
health history?

About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are
hereditary. Depending on your family history or
other features of your cancer, your health care
provider might refer you for hereditary genetic
testing to learn more about your cancer. A
genetic counselor or trained provider will speak
to you about the results. Tests results may be
used to guide treatment planning.

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families—those who are related to you
through genes passed down from biological
parent to child. This information is called
a family health history. Ask blood relatives
about their health issues like heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they
were diagnosed. For relatives who were
diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or other
relatives if they are no longer living) what
type of cancer they had, if they died from
the cancer, and at what age the cancer was
diagnosed.

Genetic testing is done collecting blood or
saliva (spitting into a cup or a cheek swab).
The goal is to look for gene mutations inherited
from your biological parents called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You
can pass these genes on to your children.
Also, other blood relatives might carry these
mutations. Tell your care team if there is a
family history of cancer.

Start by asking your parents, siblings,
and children. Next, talk to half-siblings,
aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews,
grandparents, and grandchildren.

BRCA tests
Everyone has BRCA genes. Normal BRCA
genes help to prevent tumor growth. They help
fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally.
BRCA mutations put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. Mutations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian,
prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma
skin cancers. Mutated BRCA genes can also
affect how well some treatments work. These
tests might be repeated to help determine the
best treatment.

Write down what you learn about your
family history and share with your health
care provider.
Some of the questions to ask include:

3 How old were you when each of these
diseases and health conditions was
diagnosed?

3 What is our family’s ancestry—from
what countries did our ancestors
originate?

2 Testing for DCIS » Cancer stages

Cancer stages

TNM scores
The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage breast cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different
areas of cancer growth. Based on imaging
and pathology results, a score or number
is assigned to each letter. The higher the
number, the larger the tumor or the more
the cancer has spread. These scores will be
combined to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM
example might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1,
N0, M0, or for DCIS TisN0M0.

Breast cancer staging is often done twice.




Clinical stage (c) is the rating given
before any treatment. It is based on a
physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests.
An example might look like cT0 or cN1.
Pathologic stage (p) or surgical
stage is determined by examining tissue
removed during surgery. An example
might be pT1.

A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. AJCC is just one type of staging system.







Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, 2024

T (tumor) – Depth and spread of the
main (primary) tumor(s) in one or both
breasts
N (node) – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes
M (metastasis) – If cancer has
spread to distant parts of the body or
metastasized

Lymph nodes
Lymphatic fluid, a clear fluid containing cells
that help fight infections and other diseases,
drains through channels into lymphatic
vessels. From here, lymph drains into lymph
nodes. Lymph nodes work as filters to help
fight infection. Regional lymph nodes are
found near the breast in the armpit (axilla). If
breast cancer spreads, it often goes first to
nearby lymph nodes under the arm. It can also
sometimes spread to lymph nodes near the
collarbone or near the breastbone. However, it
is possible for cancerous cells to travel through
lymph and blood to other parts of the body
without having gone to the lymph nodes first.

16

2 Testing for DCIS » Cancer stages

Grade

Numbered stages

Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells
look under a microscope (called histology).
Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread
faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means
the grade can’t be determined, followed by G1,
G2, and G3. G3 is the highest grade for breast
cancers.

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with 4
being the most advanced. They might be written
as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage
IV. For example, DCIS is stage 0 or Tis, N0, M0.



GX – Grade cannot be determined



G1 – Low (nuclear grade 1)



G2 – Intermediate (nuclear grade 2)



G3 – High (nuclear grade 3)







Stage 0 is noninvasive – Noninvasive
breast cancer is rated stage 0. DCIS is
found only in the ducts (Tis). It has not
spread to the surrounding breast tissue,
lymph nodes (N0), or distant sites (M0).
Stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive –
Invasive breast cancer is rated stage 1,
2, or 3. It has grown outside the ducts,
lobules, or breast skin. Cancer might be in
the axillary lymph nodes.
Stage 4 is metastatic – Stage 4
breast cancer has spread to distant sites.
It can develop from earlier stages or
rarely, your first diagnosis can be stage 4
metastatic breast cancer (called de novo).

More information on invasive and metastatic
breast cancers can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Testing takes time. It might take
days or weeks for all test results
to come in.

Tests are used to find cancer, plan
treatment, and check how well treatment
is working.
You will have a physical exam, including
a breast exam, to see if anything feels or
looks abnormal.
A diagnostic mammogram includes
detailed pictures of both breasts. It is
different than a screening mammogram.
During a biopsy, tissue or fluid samples
are removed for testing. Samples are
needed to confirm the presence of cancer
and to perform cancer cell tests.
Some breast cancers grow because of
estrogen. Testing will be done to see
if you have estrogen receptor-positive
(ER+) breast cancer. This provides
information about the behavior of your
cancer, as well as treatments to which
your cancer may respond.
A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are
first diagnosed. Breast cancer is often
staged twice, before and after surgery.

of oncologists include medical, radiation,
and surgical oncologists.
A reconstructive (plastic)
surgeon performs oncoplastic (breast
cancer surgery) reductions, balancing
procedures, and breast reconstruction.
Oncology nurses provide your
hands-on care, like giving systemic
therapy, managing your care, answering
questions, and helping you cope with side
effects.
Oncology pharmacists are experts
in knowing how to use medicines to treat
cancer and to manage symptoms and
side effects.
Nutritionists and dietitians can
provide guidance on what foods are most
suitable for your condition.
An occupational therapist helps
people with the tasks of daily living.
A physical therapist helps people
move with greater comfort and ease.
A certified lymphedema therapist
gives a type of massage called manual
lymph drainage.
Psychologists and psychiatrists
are mental health experts who can help
manage issues such as depression,
anxiety, or other mental health conditions
that can affect how you think and feel.

Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional issues. The anxiety a
person feels when diagnosed with cancer
might be managed by a social worker
in some cancer centers. They, or other
designated professionals, can help
navigate the complexities of financial and
insurance stresses.

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit
A history of smoking or vaping nicotine
increases your chances of developing
lung and other cancers. Smoking
and vaping can limit how well cancer
treatment works and prevent wound
healing. They also greatly increase your
chances of having side effects during and
after surgery. Cannabis use might also
affect the amount of anesthesia used
during surgery.

Spiritual care specialists identify and
support those with spiritual distress or
unmet spiritual needs.
Smoking cessation specialists
can provide medication and counseling
for those who would like to stop using
tobacco or nicotine products.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that
makes you want to keep smoking and
vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging
for most people who smoke or vape. The
stress of having cancer may make it even
harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask
your care team about counseling and
medicines to help you quit.

A research team helps to collect
research data and coordinate care if
you are in a clinical trial. Clinical trials
help bring new therapies to patients and
advance the treatment for everyone.
Consider asking your care team about
access to clinical trials.

3 Treating DCIS » Surgery

Surgery

Goal of surgery

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. Surgery is
the main or primary treatment for DCIS. This
is only one part of a treatment plan. When
preparing for surgery, seek the opinion of an
experienced surgeon. The surgeon should be
an expert in performing your type of surgery.
Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating your type of cancer.

The goal of surgery or tumor resection is to
remove all the cancer. To do so, the tumor is
removed along with a rim of normal-looking
tissue around its edge called the surgical
margin. The surgical margin may look normal
during surgery, but cancerous cells may be
found when viewed under a microscope by a
pathologist. A clear or negative margin (R0) is
when no cancer cells are found in the tissue
around the edge of the tumor. In a positive
margin, cancer cells are found in normallooking tissue around the tumor.

Your preferences about treatment are always
important. Make your wishes known.

After surgery, you may receive treatment such
as radiation to kill any remaining cancer cells.
You might have a wound drain to prevent fluid
from collecting in the body after surgery. These
drains are usually removed a few days after
surgery.

Breast-conserving surgery
The dotted line shows where the
tumor is removed. Lumpectomy is
the removal of abnormal cells or
tumor and not the whole breast. It
is also called a partial mastectomy,
breast-conserving therapy, or
breast-conserving surgery (BCS).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, 2024

22

3 Treating DCIS » Surgery

Lumpectomy

Mastectomy

Lumpectomy is the removal of abnormal cells
or tumor. It does not remove the whole breast.
A lumpectomy is also called breast-conserving
therapy or breast-conserving surgery (BCS).
In a lumpectomy, the surgeon aims to remove
all DCIS with a rim of healthy tissue around
it, called a negative, or clear, surgical margin.
Having a negative surgical margin will
decrease the chance that cancer may return
in that area of the breast. You may need more
than one surgery to achieve negative margins
and ensure all the cancer was removed. A
lumpectomy is usually followed by radiation
therapy to part of or the whole breast. It is
important to note that a lymph node biopsy is
not done with a lumpectomy.

A mastectomy removes all of the breast.
Before removing the breast, the surgeon may
do a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).
Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are the first
lymph nodes cancer cells are likely to have
spread to from the primary tumor.
Types of mastectomies include:




The breast might not look the same after a
lumpectomy. Speak to your surgeon about how
a lumpectomy might affect the look and shape
of your breast, and any concerns you have.
You can also seek the opinion of a plastic
surgeon.



Breastfeeding or chestfeeding

A skin-sparing mastectomy removes
the breast but not all of the skin, in order
to have breast reconstruction that might
include flaps and/or implants.
Nipple-sparing mastectomy
preserves the nipple-areola complex
(NAC) as well as all of the skin. Not
everyone is a candidate for nipple-sparing
mastectomy based upon location of
cancer, breast size, and breast ptosis
(degree of drooping).

Breast reconstruction is an option after a
mastectomy. It might be done at the same
time as mastectomy (immediate) or at some
time following the completion of cancer
treatment (delayed). Breast reconstruction
is most commonly done in stages. If you are
considering breast reconstruction surgery,
it requires collaboration between a breast
surgeon and a reconstructive (plastic) surgeon.

Breastfeeding or chestfeeding following a
lumpectomy may be possible. However, after
treatments, the breast may produce less
milk than before, or none. Breastfeeding/
chestfeeding is not recommended during
active treatment or within 6 months of
completing certain types of endocrine therapy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, 2024

A total mastectomy or simple
mastectomy removes the whole breast
with a flat skin closure.

23

3 Treating DCIS » Radiation therapy

Sentinel lymph node biopsy

Types of radiation therapy used in DCIS
include:

A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB or SNB)
is done during a mastectomy to determine if
any cancer cells have traveled to the lymph
nodes. A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the
first lymph node or nodes that cancer cells are
most likely to spread to from a primary tumor.
Often, there is more than one sentinel lymph
node. Just because these nodes are removed,
it does not mean that they test positive for
cancer.





To find the sentinel lymph nodes, a dye is
injected into the breast. It may be a radioactive
material, blue dye, or other tracer. The tracer
travels through the lymph channels in the
breast to the lymph nodes in the armpit.
This helps the surgeon find which of the
lymph nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes.
The lymph nodes containing the tracer are
removed and tested by a pathologist.

Whole breast radiation therapy
(WBRT) is used to treat the entire breast.
Sometimes, additional treatments may be
given to the tumor area. This is called a
boost.
Partial breast irradiation (PBI)
is used to treat only the tumor area of
the breast. Accelerated partial breast
irradiation (APBI) is radiation given over a
shorter period of time.

External beam radiation therapy
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside the body to aim radiation
at the whole breast (WBRT) or only the tumor
area of the breast (PBI).

Internal radiation

Radiation therapy

Internal radiation (brachytherapy) involves
placing one or more small tubes into the tumor
area of the breast. A small radioactive seed
travels into the tube(s) and delivers radiation
to the tumor area of the breast from inside the
body. This type of radiation is used only for
PBI.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays (photons), protons, and
other sources to kill any remaining cancer cells
after surgery. Different types of radiation can
be used for DCIS. Most types include several
short treatment sessions that are given once
daily over a few days to weeks. Ask your care
team which radiation option(s) are best for you
and what side effects to expect.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, 2024

3 Treating DCIS » Endocrine therapy

Endocrine therapy

Types of endocrine therapy that might be used
for DCIS:

The endocrine system is made up of organs
and tissues that produce hormones. Hormones
are natural chemicals released into the
bloodstream.



There are 4 hormones that might be targeted
in endocrine therapy for breast cancer:








Estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries,
but is also made by other tissues in the
body such as fat tissue.



Progesterone is made mainly by the
ovaries.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) is made by a part
of the brain called the hypothalamus. It
tells the ovaries to make estrogen and
progesterone and testicles to make
testosterone. LHRH is also called
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).





Androgen is made by the adrenal
glands, testicles, and ovaries.

Hormones may cause breast cancer to
grow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body
from making hormones or it will block what
hormones do in the body. This can help to
reduce the risk of cancer returning.



Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators
or anti-estrogens prevent hormones from
binding to receptors.
Selective estrogen receptor
modulators (SERMs) block estrogen
from attaching to hormone receptors.
They include tamoxifen and toremifene
(Fareston).
Selective estrogen receptor
degraders (SERDs) block and
destroy estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant
(Faslodex) and elacestrant (Orserdu) are
SERDs.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) agonists might be used
to suppress ovarian hormone or
testosterone production.

Endocrine therapy will suppress the production
of hormones and affect one's abilty to become
pregnant during treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist before starting endocrine
therapy.

Endocrine therapy is sometimes called
hormone therapy. It is not the same as
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) used for
menopause.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, 2024

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) stop a
type of hormone called androgen from
changing into estrogen by interfering with
an enzyme called aromatase. They do
not affect estrogen made by the ovaries.
Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors include
anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole
(Femara). Exemestane (Aromasin) is a
steroidal aromatase inhibitor.

25

3 Treating DCIS » Endocrine therapy

Testosterone

Menopause

For those assigned male at birth whose bodies
continue to make testosterone, endocrine
therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase
inhibitor with testosterone-suppressing
therapy.

In menopause, the ovaries permanently stop
producing hormones and menstrual periods
stop. Estrogen and progesterone levels are
low, but the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat
continue to make small amounts of estrogen.
If you don’t have periods, a test using a blood
sample may be used to confirm your status.

Premenopause
If you have menstrual periods, you are
in premenopause. In premenopause, the
ovaries are the main source of estrogen and
progesterone. Menstrual periods may stop
during treatment and for up to 2 years after
treatment, but often returns in those 35 years
of age and under.


Cancer treatment can cause a temporary
menopause. If you stopped having periods due
to removal of your uterus (hysterectomy) but
you still have your ovaries, then you should
have your menopausal status confirmed
with a blood test. If both ovaries have been
removed (with or without your uterus), you are
in menopause.

Tamoxifen is the endocrine treatment
option for those in premenopause.
Ovarian suppression or ablation is
frequently considered for higher risk ER+
breast cancers.



Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor
is the endocrine treatment for those in
menopause. Aromatase inhibitors include
anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane
(Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara).

Preventing pregnancy during
treatment
If you become pregnant during radiation
therapy or endocrine therapy, it can cause birth
defects. Use birth control without hormones.
Condoms are an option. Speak to your care
team about preventing pregnancy while being
treated for DCIS.

3 Treating DCIS » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.








Phase I trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Phase II trials study how well the drug
or approach works against a specific type
of cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or
approach against a standard treatment. If
the results are good, it may be approved
by the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Finding a clinical trial

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

3 Treating DCIS » Supportive care

Supportive care

Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Supportive care might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you are
feeling and about any side effects so they can
be managed. Supportive care, best supportive
care, and palliative care often mean the same
thing.

Lymphedema

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.

Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph
fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.
It may be caused when part of the lymph
system is damaged or blocked, such as
during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment, or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression devices, and
other means.

Difficulty eating
Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or other treatments might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
Healthy eating is important during treatment.
It includes eating a balanced diet, eating the
right amount of food, and drinking enough
fluids. A registered dietitian who is an expert in
nutrition and food can help. Speak to your care
team if you have trouble eating or maintaining
your weight.

Pain

Distress

Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort you are having. You might meet
with a palliative care specialist or with a pain
specialist to manage your pain.

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicine that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

3 Treating DCIS » Supportive care

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant.

Supportive care resources
More information on supportive care
is available at:
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.
A personalized survivorship care plan will
contain a summary of possible long-term
effects of treatment called late effects and list
follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care
provider will coordinate with specialists for your
follow-up care.

Keep a pain diary

Surgery is the main treatment for DCIS.
This is only one part of a treatment plan.

A pain diary is a written record that helps you
keep track of when you have pain, how bad it
is, what causes it, and what makes it better or
worse. Use a pain diary to discuss your pain
with your care team. You might be referred to
a specialist for pain management.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays (photons), electrons,
protons, and other sources to kill cancer
cells.
Some breast cancers grow because of
estrogen. These cancers are estrogen
receptor-positive (ER+) and are often
treated with endocrine therapy to reduce
the risk of cancer recurrence.

Include in your pain diary:

3 The time and dose of all medicines
3 When pain starts and ends or lessens

Chemotherapy is not used to treat DCIS.

The goal of treatment is to prevent DCIS from

surrounding tissue, it is called invasive breast
cancer. Invasive breast cancer is breast cancer
that has spread from the milk ducts or milk
glands (lobules) into the breast tissue or to
nearby lymph nodes.

Lumpectomy options

Lumpectomy with partial breast
radiation therapy

A lumpectomy is also known as breastconserving surgery (BCS). It may or may not
be followed by radiation therapy. Lymph node
surgery is not done with a lumpectomy. You
may have more than one surgery to ensure all
the cancer was removed.

When radiation therapy (RT) is given only to
the lumpectomy site, it is called partial breast
irradiation (PBI). This is an option in some
cases. You must have a low risk of the cancer
returning. Surgical margins must be cancerfree. The size, grade, and other features of the
tumor will be considered. Accelerated partial
breast irradiation (APBI) therapy is radiation
given over a shorter length of time.

A lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy is
an option for many but not all with DCIS. This
is not an option if you are pregnant, have some
health issues, or the cancer is throughout the
breast. The surgical margin must be cancerfree, called a negative surgical margin (R0).
Lumpectomy options are described next.

Lumpectomy only
Treatment with a lumpectomy only (no
radiation) is an option for a small group of
people. You must have a low risk of the
cancer coming back. Surgical margins must
be cancer-free. The size, grade, and other
features of the tumor will be considered.

Lumpectomy with whole breast
radiation therapy
Most of your breast will be treated with
radiation in whole breast radiation therapy
(WBRT). Whole breast radiation will help
to prevent the return of cancer. For every
cancer that returns there is an equal chance
of developing DCIS again or an invasive type
of cancer. Many factors are used to determine
risk of recurrence. Ask your care team if your
risk of cancer coming back is low or high. If it’s
high, you may receive extra radiation called a
boost.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, 2024

Mastectomy option
A total mastectomy or a simple mastectomy
is a surgery that removes the whole breast.
Chest muscle is not removed. A skin-sparing
mastectomy removes the breast but not all
of the skin. A nipple-sparing mastectomy
preserves the nipple-areola complex (NAC)
and the skin. Not everyone is a candidate for
nipple-sparing mastectomy. You might choose
to have a flat closure or breast reconstruction
after a mastectomy.

and anyone involved in your care to
know whom to contact with questions or

Total mastectomy with sentinel
lymph node biopsy
A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is done
at the time of mastectomy. Sentinel lymph
nodes are the first lymph nodes cancer cells
are likely to have spread to from the primary
tumor. An SLNB finds and removes a few of
these nodes. The nodes are then tested for
cancer. Once the breast is removed, an SLNB
can’t be done. Instead, many lymph nodes
would have to be removed to test for cancer.
This is because a mastectomy permanently
changes lymph flow and drainage. Therefore,
an SLNB will be done at the time of a
mastectomy just in case there is a small area
of invasive cancer in the breast.

4 Your treatment options » Endocrine therapy after lumpectomy

Endocrine therapy after
lumpectomy

There is more than one type of endocrine
therapy. The type prescribed by your care team
is partly based on if you have menstrual periods.

Endocrine therapy is often given after a
lumpectomy for cancers that are estrogen
receptor-positive (ER+). This is given to reduce
the risk of cancer returning. For treatment after
breast-conserving surgery, see Guide 3.



Endocrine therapy
Endocrine therapy includes treatments that
stop cancer growth caused by hormones. It is
sometimes called hormone therapy. It is not
the same as hormone replacement therapy

calcium and vitamin D supplement might be
recommended, but talk to your care team first.

Follow-up care

Lowering your risk
There are things you can do to lower your
chance of developing breast cancer in the
future. Changes in your lifestyle include eating
a mostly plant-based diet, exercising, limiting
alcohol, and quitting smoking. Your care team
can offer information and support on how to
lower your risk.

After treatment, you will receive follow-up
care. It is important to keep any follow-up
visits and imaging test appointments. Contact
your doctor if you have any new or worsening
symptoms.

Medical history and physical exam
An update of your medical history and a
physical exam are part of follow-up care. Both
should be done every 6 to 12 months for 5
years, then once a year after 5 years of normal
results.

Mammogram
A mammogram should be done every 12
months after breast-conserving treatment. If
you had both breasts removed to reduce your
cancer risk, then mammograms aren’t needed.

Take care of yourself. This is a
stressful time. Seek out support
groups at your local hospital,
through social media, or from
those listed in the back of this
book. Look to friends, relatives,
neighbors, and coworkers for
social support.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is
treatable. The goal of treatment is to
reduce the risk of DCIS progressing to
invasive breast cancer.
Treatment for DCIS is usually a
combination of surgery and radiation
therapy followed by endocrine therapy.

Let us know what
you think!

Surgery options include a lumpectomy
or mastectomy. A lumpectomy is also
called breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or
partial mastectomy.

Please take a moment to
complete an online survey
about the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients.

Local therapy focuses on the breast and
armpit (axilla) only. It includes surgery and
radiation therapy.

NCCN.org/patients/response

Systemic therapy works throughout the
body. It includes endocrine therapy.
Chemotherapy is not used to treat DCIS.
Lifestyle changes, endocrine therapy, and
surgery help to reduce the risk of future
breast cancer.
Follow-up care includes physical exams
and mammograms.

before surgery. This chapter offers
more information on volume
displacement, flat closure, and
breast reconstruction.

Flat closure

The recovery time for each procedure differs.
This can affect your ability to return to work
or participate in activities. You might consider
speaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery
to discuss your options and what to expect.

In a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the
entire breast, including nipple, extra skin,
fat, and other tissue in the breast area, is
removed. The remaining skin is tightened
and sewn together. No breast mound is
created, and no implant is added. The scar
will be slightly raised and differ in color than
the surrounding skin. A flat closure is not
completely flat or smooth. The result varies
from person to person. Ask to look at pictures
from flat closures so you know what to expect.

Volume displacement
With a lumpectomy, most people have a
scar with some volume loss. However, if you
need a large lumpectomy and your surgeon
thinks your breast will look more abnormal
afterwards, your breast may be able to be reshaped at the time of surgery. This procedure
is called volume displacement or oncoplasty.
Only a limited number of cancer centers
perform this procedure. It is often done by the
cancer surgeon or plastic surgeon right after
the lumpectomy. The surgeon will shift the

your treatment team for a complete list of side
effects.

Breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild
the shape and look of the breast after
a mastectomy. In many cases, breast
reconstruction involves a staged approach. It
might require more than one procedure.

Implants
Breast implants are small bags filled with salt
water, silicone gel, or both. They are placed
under the breast skin or muscle to look like a
new breast following a mastectomy. A balloonlike device, called an expander, may be used
first to stretch out tissue. It will be placed under
your skin or muscle and enlarged every few
weeks for 2 to 3 months. When your skin is
stretched to the proper size, you will have
surgery to place the final implant.

You may have a choice as to when
breast reconstruction is done. Immediate
reconstruction is finished within hours after
removing the breast. Delayed reconstruction
can occur months or years after the cancer
surgery. Reconstruction can also be done in a
staged fashion, with part of the reconstruction
done at the time of the original cancer surgery
and finished with another surgery later. A
plastic surgeon performs breast reconstruction.

Implants have a small risk of leaking or
causing other issues. You may feel pain from
the implant or expander. Scar tissue or tissue
death can occur.

Breasts can be reconstructed with implants
and flaps. All methods are generally safe,
but as with any surgery, there are risks. Ask

Your preferences about
treatment are always
important. Talk to your care
team and make your wishes
known.

5 The breast after surgery » Breast reconstruction

Flaps

Nipple replacement

Sometimes breast fullness can be recreated
after a skin-sparing mastectomy. In a skinsparing mastectomy, breast tissue is removed
from underneath the skin. The nipple remains
intact, if possible. The remaining skin flaps are
used to create a breast mound. This technique
does not use implants or skin transferred from
other parts of the body and may be completed
in a single surgery. This technique, called a
Goldilocks mastectomy, is best suited for those
with larger breasts who are willing to have
much smaller breasts as a result.

Like your breast, a nipple can be remade. To
rebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use
surrounding tissues. Also, nipples can be
remade with tissue from the thigh or other
nipple. Tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to
look more like a nipple. It is important to note
that while you can remake something to look
like a nipple, it will not have the sensation of
your real nipple. Also, a tattoo can be done to
look like a nipple without having to take tissue
from another part of the body.

Breasts can be remade using tissue from other
parts of your body, known as flaps. These flaps
are taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh,
or from under the shoulder blade. Some flaps
are completely removed and then sewn in
place. Other flaps stay attached to your body
but are slid over and sewn into place.
There are several risks associated with flaps,
including death of fat in the flap, which can
cause lumps. A hernia may result from muscle
weakness. Problems are more likely to occur
among those who have diabetes or who smoke.

Implants and flaps
Some breasts are reconstructed with both
implants and flaps. This method may give the
reconstructed breast more volume to match
the other breast. For any reconstruction, you
may need surgery on your remaining breast to
match the two breasts in size and shape.

What to consider

Key points

Some things to consider when deciding
to have flat closure or reconstruction after
mastectomy:














Your desire – You may have a strong
feeling towards flat closure or one form
of reconstruction after being given the
options. Breast reconstruction should be
a shared decision between you and your
care team. Make your wishes known.



Health issues – You may have health
issues such as diabetes or a blood
disorder that might affect or delay healing,
or make longer procedures unsafe.





Tobacco use – Smoking delays wound
healing and can cause mastectomy flap
death (necrosis), nipple-areola complex
(NAC) necrosis in a nipple-sparing
mastectomy, infection, and failure of
implant-based reconstruction. In free flap
reconstruction, smoking increases the risk
of complications. You are encouraged to
stop smoking prior to reconstruction.
Breast size and shape – There are
limits to the available sizes of breast
implants. Very large breasts or breasts
that lack tone or droop (called ptosis)
might be difficult to match. Breast
reduction surgery might be an option.
Body mass index (BMI) – Those with
an elevated BMI have an increased risk of
infections and complications with breast
reconstruction.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Volume displacement is a shifting of the
breast tissue to fill the space left by a
lumpectomy.
Flat closure is done after a mastectomy
in which the skin is tightened and sewn
together without the addition of a breast
implant.
Breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild
the shape and look of the breast.
Breasts that are fully removed in a
mastectomy can be remade with breast
implants, flaps, or both.
Removed nipples can be remade with
body tissue and/or tattooing.

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your team
share information, discuss the options, and
agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:
