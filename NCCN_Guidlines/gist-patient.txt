About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors, Version 1.2023 –

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors

Where GIST form

(GIST) are a type of soft tissue

GIST can form anywhere within the walls of
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But they are most
often found in the stomach, followed by the
small intestine (also called the small bowel).
Less commonly, GIST form in the rectum,
colon, or esophagus. GIST that form outside
the stomach tend to be more aggressive,
but those within the stomach can also grow
quickly.

sarcoma. GIST occur most often
in the wall of the stomach or small
bowel. Together, you and your
cancer care team will decide on a
treatment plan.

Symptoms
A GIST can cause health changes you can feel
or notice (symptoms). Other problems caused
by a GIST can only be found by testing.
Symptoms of GIST include:

Overview
While all GIST are considered to be
cancerous, their behavior can vary widely
from person to person. Some GIST are small,
slow-growing, and unlikely to spread. Others
may be large and grow quickly, regrow after
treatment, and spread to the liver or within the
abdominal cavity.

to them at all times. You may hear buzzing or
clicking during the scan.

Imaging and a biopsy are needed to diagnose
GIST, and to distinguish it from other types
of tumors that occur in the GI tract. Your
test results and treatment options should be
reviewed by a team of experts with experience
in treating this rare type of cancer.

MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio
waves to make pictures of areas inside the
body. It is especially good at making clear
pictures of areas of soft tissue and the liver.
Unlike a CT scan or x-ray, MRI does not use
radiation. Those with certain types of heart
monitors, pacemakers, or metal implants may
not be able to have MRI. Talk to your doctor.
Also, tell your care team if you get nervous in
tight spaces. You may be given a medicine to
help you relax.

Imaging
Abdomen and pelvis
If GIST is suspected, imaging of the abdomen
and pelvis is needed. Expect to have
computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI).

During these scans, you may be given
contrast. This substance helps make imaging
pictures clearer. It may be injected into your
vein or mixed with a liquid you drink. The
contrast may cause you to feel warm or
flushed. If you have an allergic reaction to
contrast, you may develop a rash or have
trouble breathing.

A CT scan is a more detailed type of x-ray.
It takes many images from different angles.
A computer combines the images to make
detailed pictures. During the scan, you will
lie face up on a table that moves through
a large doughnut-like machine. You will be
alone during the scan, but a technician will
be nearby. You will be able to hear and talk

Chest
For a GIST that is 2 centimeters (about the
size of a penny) or larger, imaging of the chest
may also be recommended. The purpose is to
look for signs of cancer spread. Either an x-ray
or CT scan may be performed. X-rays are
painless and use a small amount of radiation.

larger needle to remove a circular-shaped
piece of tissue is called an EUS core needle
biopsy (EUS-CNB). A pathologist examines
the removed tissue under a microscope to
determine whether the tumor is a GIST.

Biopsy

Knowing whether the tumor has certain
features, called biomarkers, can help guide
your treatment. Biomarkers are often genetic
changes (mutations). The presence (or lack)
of specific mutations or other biomarkers
can affect how the GIST responds to certain
targeted therapies.

Biomarker testing

Your doctor may want to remove a small
sample of the tumor for testing (a biopsy). If
needed, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)guided biopsy is recommended. A thin tube
(endoscope) is inserted through the mouth.
It is guided down the esophagus into the
stomach. The endoscope has an ultrasound
probe and a needle for removing a sample of
the GIST. The ultrasound probe sends images
to a monitor. This allows your doctor to see
where to position the biopsy needle.

If treatment with drug therapy is planned,
the biopsy sample will be used for biomarker
testing. Testing for many genetic biomarkers at
one time is called next-generation sequencing
(NGS). NGS can find gene mutations for which
targeted treatments may be available. The
results help your treatment team choose the
best drug therapy for your GIST.

If a thin, hollow needle is used, it is called
an EUS fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUSFNAB). This type removes a small amount
of fluid and tumor tissue. Use of a slightly

Chest x-ray
For a GIST larger than 2
cm, imaging of the chest
with either x-ray or CT
may be recommended. A
chest x-ray (shown here)
is painless and uses a
very small amount of
radiation.

Other names for biomarker testing include

testing, tumor gene testing, somatic genomic
testing, and mutation testing.

(SDH) is a protein within cells that converts
sugar to energy. Many GIST without a KIT or
PDGFRA mutation have SDH deficiency. This
means that a part of the SDH gene is inactive.

KIT and PDGFRA gene mutations
Mutations in the KIT gene are the most
common genetic changes found in GIST. About
7 to 8 out of 10 GIST have a KIT mutation. The
next most common mutations are those in the
platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha
(PDGFRA) gene. PDGFRA mutations are
often found in stomach GIST.

SDH-deficient GIST typically form in the
stomach in younger people but can also be
seen later in life. Four out of 5 grow slowly
while others can be more aggressive. These
are likely to spread in the body through lymph
nodes, blood, or within the abdominal cavity.
Referral to a genetic counselor for inherited
(germline) testing is recommended for
everyone with SDH-deficient GIST.

KIT and PDGFRA mutations cause cells
to grow. In most cases, KIT and PDGFRA
mutations are acquired. This means they
happen during a person’s lifetime. If a GIST
doesn’t have either of these mutations, testing
for SDH and other mutations (described next)
is recommended.

Other biomarkers
In addition to SDH deficiency, GIST without a
KIT or PDGFRA mutation should be tested for
other, rare biomarkers. These include BRAF
mutations, NF1 mutation, NTRK fusions, and
FGFR fusions. Referral to a genetic counselor
for inherited (germline) testing assessment is
recommended for those with GIST that have
NF1 mutation.

SDH deficiency
For GIST without a KIT or PDGFRA mutation,
testing to look for an SDH mutation is
recommended. Succinate dehydrogenase

Staging

Stomach GIST

A combination of imaging and pathology
(tumor tissue tests) are used to determine the
stage of GIST.

Stage I - GIST is smaller than 5 cm (stage IA)
or between 5 and 10 cm (stage IB). The mitotic
rate is low.

The radiology report will include the size and
location. The pathology report will include the
size, location, and mitotic rate of the GIST.
Mitotic rate is explained below. For GIST that
have complex or unusual features, referral
to a center that is experienced in sarcoma
diagnosis is recommended.

Stage II - The GIST may be small and have a
high mitotic rate, or it may be large and have a
low mitotic rate.
Stage III - The GIST is at least 5 cm and has
a high mitotic rate.
Stage IV - The cancer has spread to nearby
lymph nodes or to distant areas of the body
(metastasized).

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging
system is used for GIST. The following factors
are considered to determine the cancer stage.

Small bowel GIST

Tumor size - The primary tumor is measured
in centimeters (cm). For reference, a golf ball
is 4 cm. A baseball is 7 cm. A grapefruit is 15
cm.

Stage I – The GIST is smaller than 5 cm. The
mitotic rate is low.
Stage II - The tumor is between 5 and 10 cm.
The mitotic rate is low.

Spread to lymph nodes - Lymph nodes
work as filters to help fight infection and
remove harmful things from your body. Lymph
nodes near the tumor are referred to as
“regional.” Spread to lymph nodes is rare for
GIST, except in SDH-deficient, NTRK-fusion
positive, or FGFR-fusion positive GIST. These
tend to be less aggressive than other GIST.

Stage IIIA - The tumor may be very small
and have a high mitotic rate, or it may be large
and have a low mitotic rate.
Stage IIIB - The tumor could be small or
large. The mitotic rate is high.
Stage IV - The cancer has spread to nearby
lymph nodes or to distant areas of the body
(metastasized).

Mitotic rate refers to how fast the cells make
copies of themselves. A low mitotic rate is
slower than a high mitotic rate. This can often
only be determined after a tumor is removed,
or if a sufficient amount of tissue is obtained at
the time of biopsy.
Metastasis is the spread of cancer to distant
areas. GIST most often spreads to the liver or
to the lining of the abdomen (the peritoneum).

For a GIST that is 2 cm or larger, a chest
x-ray or chest CT may be recommended
to look for cancer spread.
If drug therapy is planned before surgery,
a biopsy is needed to confirm GIST.

Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.

If needed, the type of biopsy generally
recommended for GIST is an endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS)-guided needle biopsy.

Your test results and treatment

All other GIST

options should be reviewed

Surgery to resect (remove) the GIST may
be your first treatment. This is only possible
if it does not put you at very high risk for
complications. Depending on the size
and location of the tumor, surgery can be
difficult. GIST are fragile and easily rupture.
In addition, nearby organs and tissues may
be affected. Blood vessels might have to
be removed, or pieces of them cut out and
sewn back together. Parts of your stomach or
other organs might have to be removed and
reattached. Surgery to remove a GIST requires
a great deal of skill.

by a team of experts from
different fields of surgery and
medicine who have experience in
treating gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GIST). This is called
multidisciplinary cancer care.

Treatment

The best possible surgical outcome is called
complete resection or negative margin
resection. Doctors call this “R0.” This means
that no tumor cells remain in the spot from
which the tumor was removed (the “tumor
bed”). All of the tumors must be removed in
order to have a negative margin. This is not
always possible.

When possible, surgery is the recommended
treatment for most GIST. If there is a high risk
of complications from surgery, drug therapy
may be given first. Some very small stomach
GIST do not need treatment.

Very small stomach GIST

If there is a high risk of serious problems from
surgery, you may have drug therapy first. It
can shrink the tumor and make surgery less
risky. If drug therapy is planned, the tumor will
be biopsied. This serves two main purposes.
The biopsy sample is tested to confirm that the
tumor is a GIST. The sample is also used for
biomarker testing.

Stomach GIST smaller than 2 centimeters
(cm) are unlikely to spread. Using the biopsy
results (if performed) and imaging scans, your
doctor will look for features that suggest the
tumor will grow quickly. If high-risk features
are found, an operation to remove the GIST
is recommended. This is also called surgical
resection. See “Treatment after surgery” on
page 14 for next steps.

Biomarker testing is needed because some
drug therapies work best in cancers with
certain gene mutations or other biomarkers.
For recommended drug therapy according
to biomarker, see Guide 1. If the GIST
does not have any of the biomarkers listed in
Guide 1, drug therapy before surgery is not
recommended. It is important to take your drug
therapy, known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor

For very small stomach GIST without high-risk
features, no treatment is needed. Instead, the
tumor may be monitored with endoscopy or
imaging tests. This option has risks. Talk with
your doctor about whether surveillance is the
best option for you.

surgery, more treatment may be needed. See

(TKI), as directed. GIST may worsen if you
stop taking your medicine or if you miss doses.
Before starting drug therapy, you will have a
CT and/or MRI scan of your abdomen and
pelvis. Your doctor might also order a PET/CT.
During drug therapy, imaging will be used to
check how treatment is working. Either a CT
or MRI is recommended every 2 to 3 months.
These results will be compared to your original
(baseline) scans.

It is hard to know the true extent of the
cancer before surgery. The surgeon may
find cancer in veins, arteries, or other
organs. Ask your surgeon what might be
removed during surgery and what this
means in terms of healing and recovery
time.

If the tumor shrinks or stops growing, drug
therapy will be continued until your doctor
feels it has provided all of the benefit it can.
This may take 6 to 9 months, or more. At that
time, your doctor and surgeon will decide

Treatment for GIST » Surveillance after surgery » Recurrence or spread

Surveillance after surgery

Recurrence or spread

The return of cancer after treatment is called
recurrence. Testing is used to find signs of
recurrence early. This is called surveillance.
Surveillance after complete resection of a
GIST includes physical exams and imaging
scans of your abdomen and pelvis.

Recurrent describes cancer that returns after
treatment. Metastatic describes cancer that
has spread to areas of the body far from where
it started. Recurrent or metastatic GIST is
treated with drug therapy. It is usually needed
lifelong.

These are recommended every 3 to 6 months
for 5 years after surgery. For those at high
risk of recurrence, testing every 3 months is
recommended. After 5 years, most people
have imaging and a physical exam once per
year.

Imatinib is the preferred first-line therapy
for GIST with mutations that respond to it,
including most PDGFRA exon 18 mutations.
Avapritinib is preferred for GIST with PDGFRA
exon 18 mutations that do not respond to
imatinib, including D842V.

Some people may need less frequent
surveillance. Those with low-risk or very
small tumors may have imaging less often
than described above. And those with highrisk tumors who stop TKI therapy may have
imaging more often. Talk to your doctor about
how often is right for you.

If you are not a candidate for imatinib or
avapritinib, you may have other options.
This depends on the mutations found during
biomarker testing. Options for less common
biomarkers are listed below.
For NTRK gene fusion-positive GIST:
larotrectinib or entrectinib
For SDH-deficient GIST:
sunitinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, imatinib +
binimetinib, or clinical trial

Tumor rupture

For BRAF V600E-mutated GIST:
dabrafenib + trametinib

While rare, these fragile tumors may
become damaged or punctured, causing
cancer cells to spill into the abdomen.
This can happen spontaneously or
during surgery. If this happens, lifelong
treatment with drug therapy is usually
needed.

Treatment for GIST » Progression

Progression

An alternative recommended option may be
increasing your imatinib dose, if you are taking
standard-dose imatinib. This may work best in
those with KIT exon 9 mutations.

The tumor may grow or spread while taking
imatinib or avapritinib. If the new growth is
limited, it may be possible to remove or control
the cancer using local treatments. These
include:





If the new growth is widespread, switching
TKIs or increasing the dose of imatinib is
typically only considered for those who are
fairly healthy otherwise. Doctors call this
performance status. It is a rating of your ability
to do daily tasks independently.

Resection (surgery)
Ablation, embolization, or
chemoembolization (see next page for
more information on these)

If GIST spreads or continues to grow
despite treatment with the TKIs shown in the
illustration, there are others that may be given.
Your doctor may suggest doing another biopsy.
The goal is to look for uncommon mutations
that may have a corresponding targeted
therapy. Consider enrolling in a clinical trial for
treatment. Your care team can help you find

Palliative radiation therapy to relieve
symptoms

Another recommended option for progression
is to switch to a different TKI. See the

after imatinib or avapritinib, and beyond.

Treatment for GIST » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Local treatments

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Ablation destroys small tumors. A
special needle called a probe is placed
into or next to the tumor, often with
the help of an imaging test. The use of
extreme cold (cryoablation) or extreme
heat (e.g., microwave or radiofrequency
ablation) to kill cancer cells is known
as thermal ablation. Non-thermal
types of ablation include irreversible
electroporation (IRE), also known as
“NanoKnife.”

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Embolization treats tumors by cutting
off their blood supply. A catheter is
inserted into an artery and guided to the
tumor. Once in place, beads are inserted
to block the blood flow.
In chemoembolization, the beads
are coated with chemotherapy.
Radioembolization uses small
radioactive beads.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

Best supportive care is always an option for
progressive GIST. It is used alone or with other
treatments to improve quality of life. This care
might include reintroducing TKI therapy to help
manage symptoms.



Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety, and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Who can enroll?

Finding a clinical trial

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.
Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,

This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

Treatment













After 5 years, most people have imaging
and a physical exam once per year.

Progression

Surgery is recommended for GIST that
are 2 cm or larger.



No treatment is needed for very small,
low-risk stomach GIST. You may have
testing to monitor the size of the tumor.
But surveillance instead of surgery has
risks. Talk with your doctor about whether
it is the best option for you.



When possible, surgery is recommended
for all other GIST. If surgery is too risky,
you may have drug therapy first to shrink
the tumor.
If needed, the best drug treatment for
you depends on the mutations and other
features found during biomarker testing.
Most GIST have either KIT or PDGFRA
mutations. Imatinib is often the best
choice for these tumors.
Avapritinib is recommended for GIST with
certain PDGFRA mutations that don’t
respond to imatinib, like D842V.
Other options for drug therapy are
available for GIST with the following
biomarkers: SDH-deficiency, NTRK
fusion-positive, and BRAF V600E
mutation.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST), 2023

After complete resection, a physical exam
and CT scan are recommended every 3
to 6 months for 5 years after surgery.

19

For GIST that progresses through all
recommended drug therapies, consider
enrolling in a clinical trial for treatment.
Best supportive care is always an option
for progressive GIST. It aims to improve
quality of life.

Making treatment decisions » It’s your choice » Questions to ask

It’s important to be comfortable

If you take the time to build a relationship with
your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects






Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, check out the websites listed in this
book.

Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life and length of life

Questions to ask

How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST), 2023

Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
