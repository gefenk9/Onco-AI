About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Head and Neck Cancers Version 1.2024 – October 9, 2023.

Throat cancer basics » The throat » The pharynx

The throat is located in the back



of the mouth and in the neck.
Cancer can form in part of the
throat called the oropharynx. The



oropharynx includes the back of



the roof of the mouth (soft palate),


the tonsils, the side and back
walls of throat, and the base of the
tongue.



Trachea or windpipe leads to the lungs.

Hypopharynx

Cancer can be found in any part of the
pharynx. This book will focus on cancer of the
oropharynx and will refer to the oropharynx
as the throat. The oropharynx includes the
back of the roof of the mouth (soft palate), the
tonsils, the side and back walls of the throat,
and the base of the tongue found in the throat.

Oral cavity is another name for mouth.
Hard palate is the hard, front part of the
roof of the mouth behind the teeth.
Soft palate is the soft, back part of the
roof of the mouth.

Esophagus is a hollow muscular
tube that carries food and liquid to the
stomach.

The pharynx (said fair-inks) has 3 parts:

Some important structures of the throat and
mouth:

Larynx is a specific part of the throat
also known as the voice box.

The pharynx is part of the throat and starts
behind the nose (nasal cavity) and opens into
the larynx and esophagus.

The throat is a hollow, muscular tube inside
the neck that starts behind the nose and
ends at the top of the trachea (windpipe)
and esophagus (the tube that goes to the
stomach). The throat acts as a passageway
for air to enter the lungs and food and liquid
to enter the esophagus. It contains many
structures, including the tonsils, pharynx, and
larynx.

Throat cancer basics » Head and neck cancers

Head and neck cancers
It is strongly recommended,
when possible, for those with
head and neck cancer to be
treated at a high-volume center
or hospital that has experience in
their type of cancer.

Head and neck cancers are a group of cancers
that arise in the head or neck area of the body.
Cancer is named and treated based on the
tumor location or where the cancer started.
Cancer can occur in the:










Mouth (oral cavity),
Middle part of the throat near the mouth
(oropharynx),
Space behind the nose (nasal cavity and
paranasal sinuses),

More information on mouth cancer and
nasopharyngeal cancer can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Upper part of the throat near the nasal
cavity (nasopharynx),
Voice box (larynx), or
Lower part of the throat behind the larynx
(hypopharynx).

Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
neck (SCCHN or HNSCC) is the most common
type of head and neck cancer. It forms in
the thin, flat cells of the mucus membranes
of the mouth (oral), nose (nasal), and throat
(pharynx). Mucus is a thick, slippery fluid.
Squamous cells are found throughout the
body, including the skin.

Throat cancer

Key points

Throat cancer starts in the oropharynx.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most
common type of throat cancer and is the focus
of this book.





Cancer cells form a tumor called a primary
tumor within the area of the oropharynx. This
area includes the back of the roof of the mouth
(soft palate), the tonsils, the side and back
walls of throat, and base of the tongue. Tumors
can grow into nearby tissue and organs, such
as the voice box (larynx). Cancer cells often
spread to lymph nodes in the neck, and less
frequently, the lungs, liver, or spine.

Testing for throat cancer » Test results

Treatment planning starts with



testing. This chapter presents an
overview of the tests you might
receive and what to expect.



Test results
Results from imaging studies and a biopsy
will be used to determine your treatment plan.
Treatment will be based on these findings. It
is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions and keep copies of your
test results. Online patient portals are a great
way to access your test results. Please discuss
your results with your health care provider.









Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.
Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.
Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.
They are great partners in your care.
In your contact list, include information on
the exact type of cancer, as well as any
treatments and the date each treatment
started.

For possible tests, see Guide 1.

Keep these things in mind:


Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.

Testing for throat cancer » General health tests

General health tests

Family history
Head and neck cancers are not inherited
from your biological parents. However, some
cancers and other diseases can run in families.
Your care team will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members on both sides of
your family about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what
age they were diagnosed. It’s important to
know the specific type of cancer or where the
cancer started, if it is in multiple locations, and
if they had genetic testing.

Some general health tests are described next.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Guide 1
Tests for treatment planning
Biopsy of main tumor with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing by p16
Medical history, tobacco and alcohol use history, and physical exam, including complete head and
neck exam. Mirror and fiberoptic exam if needed. Screen for depression.
CT scan with contrast and/or MRI with or without contast of main tumor and neck
As needed:
• Endoscopy with examination under anesthesia (EUA)
• Pre-anesthesia exam
• FDG-PET/CT
• Chest CT (with or without contrast)
• Dental exam and x-ray (Panorex)
• Nutrition, speech, and swallowing evaluation, and hearing test (audiogram)
• Help to quit smoking
• Fertility counseling
• Screening for hepatitis B

Testing for throat cancer » General health tests

Tobacco and alcohol use history

Dental exam

Tobacco and alcohol use are known risk
factors for developing head and neck cancer
and can limit how well treatment works.Their
use can affect survival. You will be asked
about your tobacco and alcohol use history
and asked to avoid tobacco and limit alcohol
use during treatment. Speak to your care team
if you have any questions or concerns.

It is important to tell your dentist about your
head and neck cancer and to have regular
dental cleanings and checkups. Head and
neck cancer and its treatment can affect the
health of your jaw, teeth, and gums. If you
need any dental work or procedures, they
might be recommended before starting certain
treatment.

Physical exam

Distress screening

During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:

It is normal to have strong feelings about being
diagnosed with cancer, and your feelings can
change from day to day and week to week.
Talk to your care team and those whom you
feel most comfortable about how you are
feeling. There are services and people who
can help you. Support and counseling are
available. Many treatment teams include mind
and body therapists who can help.



Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat





Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.

Dealing with a cancer diagnosis can be
stressful and may cause further distress.
Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You
may also experience depression, anxiety, and
sleep issues. Your treatment team will screen
your level of distress. This is part of your
cancer care.

Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

Complete head and neck exam
A physical exam will include the head and
neck. Since the oropharynx is found inside
the throat, some parts are not easy to see
when your mouth is open. A doctor might use
a special mirror or fiberoptic scope passed
through your mouth or nose to look at these
areas.

Testing for throat cancer » General health tests

Hearing test

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit

A hearing test shows if there is any hearing
loss, and if so, the type of hearing loss, how
severe it is, and what might have caused it. An
audiogram is a graph showing the results of a
pure-tone hearing test. Tumors in the head and
neck can affect hearing. Treatment of head
and neck tumors can also affect hearing.

A history of smoking or vaping nicotine
increases your chances of developing
head and neck, lung, and other cancers.
Smoking and vaping can limit how well
cancer treatment works and prevent
wound healing. They also greatly increase
your chances of having side effects during
and after surgery. Cannabis use might
also affect the amount of anesthesia used
during surgery.

Hepatitis B and hepatitis C
screening
Hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) are
types of liver disease caused by a virus. A
hepatitis blood test will tell your treatment team
if you had hepatitis in the past or if you have it
today. Some cancer treatments can wake up
(or reactivate) the virus. If this happens, it can
cause harm to the liver.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that
makes you want to keep smoking and
vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging
for most people who smoke or vape. The
stress of having cancer may make it even
harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask
your care team about counseling and
medicines to help you quit. In head and
neck cancers, stopping smoking or vaping
is essential to maximize the chance for
cure and minimize side effects.

Lung function tests
Lung function tests or pulmonary function tests
(PFTs) measure how well the lungs work. They
measure how much air the lungs can hold and
how quickly air is moved into and out of the
lungs. They also measure how much oxygen is
used and how much carbon dioxide is given off
during breathing.

For online support, try these websites:

Nutrition assessment
You should meet with a nutrition expert before
starting treatment. A nutritionist or dietician
can suggest the best foods and fluids for you.
It is important that you receive adequate and
sustained nutrition before you start treatment.
During and after treatment, your treatment
team will monitor you for weight loss and other
signs you aren’t receiving enough nutrition.

Performance status

Pre-anesthesia exam

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
self-care tasks. Your state of general health
will be rated using a PS scale called Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). PS
is one factor taken into consideration when
choosing a treatment plan. Your preferences
about treatment are always important. The
ECOG PS scores range from 0 to 5.

Anesthesia is loss of feeling or awareness
caused by drugs. It keeps you from feeling
pain from surgery or other procedures. A
pre-anesthesia assessment will be done by
the anesthesiologist. It will include a physical
exam of your throat and airway. You be asked
questions about your medical history, past
surgery experiences, if you have any allergies
to drugs or medicines, your understanding of
the procedure, and how your appearance and
function might change. Head and neck cancer
surgery is complex. It is further complicated by
other health conditions, airway and swallowing
issues, tobacco and alcohol use, and tumor
location. Being prepared and knowing what to
expect after surgery will help prevent severe
complications.










PS 0 means the person is fully active.
PS 1 means the person is still able to
perform light to moderate activity, but with
some limitations.
PS 2 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed less than half of the time and
is still able to care for self.
PS 3 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed more than half of the time.
PS 4 means the person is totally confined
to the bed or chair and completely unable
to care for self.
PS 5 means the person is not alive.

In head and neck cancer, PS might be referred
to as good or poor. Good PS is usually PS 0 or
PS 1.

Testing for throat cancer » Fertility (all genders)

Fertility (all genders)

Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect
your fertility, the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might change your fertility. To preserve your
fertility, you may need to take action before
starting cancer treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options
before starting treatment.
Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want
to have children later in life or aren’t really
sure at the moment. Fertility and reproductive
specialists can help you sort through what may
be best for your situation.
More information on fertility preservation is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Testing for throat cancer » Preventing pregnancy during treatment » p16 (HPV) testing

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment

Those with testicles
Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth
control) such as condoms to prevent
pregnancy during and immediately after cancer
treatment.

Preventing pregnancy during treatment is
important. Cancer and cancer treatment
can affect the ovaries and damage sperm.
Hormonal birth control may or may not be
recommended, so ask your doctor about
options such as intrauterine devices (IUDs)
and barrier methods. Types of barrier methods
include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps,
and the contraceptive sponge.

p16 (HPV) testing
For throat cancer, biopsy samples are
tested for the p16 protein to see if human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection is present. This
is a key part of staging (finding out if and how
much the cancer has spread) and expected
treatment results, and is considered when
making treatment decisions. Cancers that
are linked to HPV tend to respond better to
treatment. p16 testing is different than HPV
testing. p16 is used as a surrogate marker for
HPV infection because p16 usually increases
in cancer cells when HPV is present.

Those with ovaries
Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing
baby if you are or become pregnant during
treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding at the time of your cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.

HPV
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of
viruses that infect the cells on the surface of
skin or on the moist surfaces or inner linings
of some organs and body cavities, such as the
cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, mouth, and
throat. HPV infection usually clears on its own.
However, HPV infections can cause abnormal
tissue growth (warts) and sometimes cancer.
Cancer caused by HPV is called HPV-related
cancer.

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
“period” may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended during and after treatment.
Consult your doctor for the best time to plan a
pregnancy.

Testing for throat cancer » p16 (HPV) testing

HPV is the main cause of squamous cell
carcinomas of the throat (oropharynx),
particularly cancers of the tonsils and base
of the tongue. HPV type 16 is responsible
for 9 out of 10 throat cancers. The remaining
cancers are caused by HPV18, 33, and 35.
HPV-positive (HPV+) throat cancer is a distinct
disease with specific tumor features that can
be targeted during treatment.

HPV+, p16+/HPV+, or p16 (HPV)-positive.
However, HPV+ cancer can be p16-. This
might be written as p16-/HPV+.

p16
HPV16 is detected using a test to look for p16.
p16 is a protein that slows cell division. It is
produced by a gene located on chromosome 9
(shown as 9p21.3). Human cells have 23 pairs
of chromosomes or 46 chromosomes in total.
Testing to look for the presence (expression)
of p16 is called biomarker testing. p16 can
be found in cancers such as throat, cervical,
vulvar, melanoma, and esophageal. When too
much (overexpression) of p16 is found in throat
cancer, it means that the cancer is usually
caused by HPV. It might be written as p16+,

Your preferences about
treatment are always
important. Talk to your
care team and make your
wishes known.

Testing for throat cancer » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Imaging tests show the primary
tumor, or where the cancer started, and
look for cancer in other parts of the body. A
radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report to
your health care provider (HCP). It is likely that
the report will be sent directly to you through
your patient portal or patient access system.
You should discuss these results with your
HCP. Some imaging tests are described next.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that
help enhance and improve the images of
several organs and structures in the body. It is
used to make the pictures clearer. The contrast
is not permanent and will leave the body in
your urine immediately after the test. The types
of contrast vary and are different for CT and
MRI.

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. A CT scan
takes many x-rays of the same body part from
different angles. All the images are combined
to make one detailed picture. A CT scan of
your neck and chest may be one of the tests to
look for cancer. In most cases, contrast will be
used.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of the inside of the body. It
does not use x-rays and there is no radiation
exposure. Because of the very strong magnets
used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist
if you have any metal in your body. During
the test, you will likely be asked to hold your
breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician
collects the images. Contrast is often used.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

Testing for throat cancer » Imaging tests

PET scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive sugar-based substance
called a tracer. A tracer is injected into a vein
to see where cancer cells are in the body
and if they are using sugar produced by your
body to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright
spots on PET scans. However, not all tumors
will appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright
spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain,
heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on
PET. Inflammation or infection can also show
up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

Keep these things in mind

FDG-PET/CT
An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called
F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made
of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called
glucose. You cannot eat or drink for at least
4 hours before the scan. This scan is most
helpful when other imaging results are unclear.
It may help identify cancer in primary sites,
lymph nodes, and/or distant sites. If it clearly
shows cancer in the bone, a bone scan and
sodium fluoride PET/CT may not be needed.
FDG-PET/CT can be done at the same time as
a CT used for diagnosis.

Take care of yourself. This is a
stressful time. Seek out and ask for
support. Support can be a friend,
relative, neighbor, or coworker.

•

This will be a confusing time. You
will hear a lot of unfamiliar words.
Interact with your health care team,
ask questions, and talk about how
you feel.

Panoramic dental x-ray
A panoramic dental x-ray or panoramic x-ray
(Panorex) uses a very small dose of radiation
to capture the entire mouth in one image,
including the teeth, upper and lower jaw,
and surrounding structures and tissues. It
is commonly performed by dentists and oral
surgeons in everyday practice and may be
used to plan treatment for dentures, braces,
extractions, and implants.

Ultrasound
Ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer)
will be held and moved on your neck using
gel. Ultrasound is painless and does not use
x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed.
Ultrasound is good at showing small areas
of cancer that may be in lymph nodes.
Sometimes, an ultrasound or CT is used to
guide a fine-needle biopsy (FNB).

Testing for throat cancer » Scoping procedures

Scoping procedures

Laryngoscopy and
nasolaryngoscopy

Some imaging tests use a thin, tube-shaped
tool called a scope that is inserted into the
mouth or nose body to examine the oropharynx
and to take pictures. One end of the scope
has a small light and camera lens to see inside
your body. The image is sent to a television or
computer monitor. This will also help guide your
doctor in performing a biopsy.

Laryngoscopy is an exam of the back of your
throat, including your voice box (larynx) or
behind your voice box (hypopharynx). It uses a
laryngoscope, which is a thin, long tube fitted
with a fiberoptic light. Your voice box contains
your vocal cords and allows you to speak. A
laryngoscope is used to look for tumors in the
throat and voice box (larynx) and hypopharynx.

More than one type of scope may be used for
imaging tests. The type of scope often used
for head and cancer is called an endoscope.
An endoscope is often guided into the body
through the mouth or nose. Endoscopy might
be used to determine the size and spread of
tumor and to take a tumor sample. Before an
endoscopy, you will be given a topical spray to
numb the throat.

Laryngoscopy may be done in different ways:




Some possible endoscopies are described
next. You might not have an endoscopy.

Fiberoptic
nasopharyngolaryngoscopy


Fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy is used
to examine the larynx (voice box) and nearby
structures. It is done while you are awake with
a topical spray to make you more comfortable.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

20

Indirect laryngoscopy uses a small
mirror held at the back of your throat. The
doctor shines a light on the mirror to view
the throat area. Medicine to numb the
back of your throat may be used.
Fiberoptic laryngoscopy
(nasolaryngoscopy) uses a small
flexible scope passed through your
nose and into your throat. Numbing
medicine will be sprayed in your nose.
This procedure typically takes less than 1
minute.
Direct laryngoscopy is a more detailed
exam performed under general anesthesia
in an operating room. It uses a scope
called a laryngoscope placed in the back
of your throat. This procedure allows
the doctor to see deeper in the throat
and to take a tissue sample for a biopsy.
The purpose of direct laryngoscopy
is to identify the primary (main) tumor
and determine if it is resectable (can be
removed with surgery).

Testing for throat cancer » Scoping procedures

Esophagoscopy
In an esophagoscopy, a device is guided down
the throat into the esophagus. It is performed
under anesthesia in an operating room. This
allows the doctor to examine your esophagus
(swallowing tube) for abnormal growths.

Create a medical binder
A medical binder or notebook is a great way
to organize all of your records in one place.

Bronchoscopy
During a bronchoscopy, a device is inserted
through the nose or mouth to examine the
inside of your airway, including the trachea
and bronchi. Bronchoscopy may be used to
detect cancer or to perform some treatment
procedures. It is done under anesthesia to
make you more comfortable.

results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

3 Choose a binder that meets your

insurance cards.

Panendoscopy

3 Create folders for insurance forms, test

During a panendoscopy, different types of
endoscopes are passed down the mouth or
nose to do a laryngoscopy, pharyngoscopy,
esophagoscopy, or bronchoscopy. This allows
a doctor to thoroughly examine the mouth,

Biopsy

Biomarker testing

A biopsy removes a sample of tissue or fluid.
Samples removed during a biopsy or surgery
will be sent to a pathologist, an expert in
examining cells using a microscope (called
cytology) to confirm the presence of cancer.
The pathologist will determine the cancer
subtype called tumor histology.

Biomarker tumor testing includes tests of
genes or their products (proteins). It identifies
the presence or absence of mutations and
certain proteins that might suggest treatment.
This information is used to choose the best
treatment for you. It is sometimes called
molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor
sequencing, gene expression profiling, or
genomic testing.

A fine-needle aspiration (FNA), fine-needle
biopsy (FNB), and core needle biopsy (CNB)
use needles of different sizes to remove a
sample of tumor or lymph node. An ultrasound
(US) or CT scan might be used to guide a
lymph node biopsy.

Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total
of 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome
contains thousands of genes. Genes are
coded instructions for the proteins your cells
make. Most genes contain information about a
specific protein. A mutation is when something
goes wrong in the genetic code.

Biopsy of metastasis
Metastasis is the spread of cancer to an area
of the body such as lymph nodes or lung. A
biopsy of the metastasis may be needed to
confirm the presence of cancer. If there is
more than one metastasis, each site may be
biopsied. The type of biopsy used depends on
the location of the suspected metastases and
other factors.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

MSI-H/dMMR mutation
Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of
DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are
fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.
Some cancers have DNA mutations or
changes that prevent these errors from being
fixed. This is called microsatellite instability
(MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).
When cancer cells have more than a normal
number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H
(microsatellite instability-high). This is often
due to dMMR genes.

22

Testing for throat cancer » Biomarker testing

PD-L1 testing

Tumor mutation testing

Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an
immune protein. If this protein is expressed
on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause
your immune cells to ignore the cancer and
suppress the anti-tumor immune response.
This is designed to activate your immune
system to better fight off the cancer cells. PDL1 expression is measured using a combined
positive score (CPS), which measures the
immune proteins in your tumor and your
immune system. If your cancer expresses this
protein and has a CPS of at least 1 percent
(1%) or higher, you might have treatment
that combines chemotherapy and an immune
checkpoint inhibitor therapy, or have immune
checkpoint inhibitor therapy by itself.

Tumor mutation testing or tumor genomic
aberration testing uses a sample of your tumor
or blood to see if the cancer cells have any
specific DNA mutations. This is a different type
of DNA testing than the genetic testing for
mutations you may have inherited from your
biological parents. In tumor mutation testing,
only the tumor is tested and not the rest of
your body. Some mutations can be targeted
with specific therapies.

Cell-free DNA testing
Cell-free or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
testing uses a sample of blood to look for
cancer cells or for pieces of DNA from tumor
cells. Although this test is not a recommended
standard and its use has not been agreed
upon, many providers use it to monitor
treatment response and for cancer recurrence.

Tumor p16 (HPV) testing
HPV testing by p16 is recommended
for everyone diagnosed with throat
(oropharyngeal) cancer. It is used to learn
more information about your cancer. Testing
will be done on a biopsy of your tumor from
either your throat, a lymph node, or other sites
in your body if needed.

Tumor mutational burden
When there are 10 or more mutations per
million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H).
Metastatic or unresectable TMB cancers
are often treated using immune checkpoint
inhibitors that target the proteins called
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).

Throat cancer staging » How throat cancer is staged

Cancer staging is used to reflect



prognosis and to guide treatment
decisions. It describes the size



and location of the tumor and if
cancer has spread to lymph nodes



or other parts of the body. Testing
for p16 (HPV) is an important part



of staging. This chapter explains
throat cancer stages.

A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging. Cancer staging
is not the same for all cancer types and
locations.

Grade of the cancer (G): How much
do the cancer cells look like normal cells?
Biomarker testing: Does the cancer
have any genes, proteins such as p16, or
mutations that might suggest treatment?

Staging includes:




Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A
prognosis is the course your cancer will likely
take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.

Anatomic – based on extent of cancer
as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node
status (N), and distant metastasis (M).
Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM
plus tumor grade. The prognostic stage
also includes the assumption that you
are treated with the standard-of-care
approaches.

Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and
pathologic. Cancer staging is often done twice,
before and after surgery. Staging after surgery
provides more specific and accurate details
about the size of the cancer and lymph node
status.

Information gathered during staging:
The extent (size) of the tumor (T):
How large is the cancer? Has it grown
into nearby areas?

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

The spread (metastasis) to distant
sites (M): Has the cancer spread to
distant organs such as the lungs or liver?

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins. Doctors may
explain your cancer stage in different ways
than described next.

The spread to nearby lymph nodes

Throat cancer staging » How throat cancer is staged

Clinical stage

Pathologic stage

Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before
any treatment. It is based on a physical exam,
biopsy, and imaging tests. An example might
look like cN2 or cM1. In throat cancer, the
clinical (before surgery) stage is based on
imaging results. These tests are done before
any treatment as part of an initial diagnosis.
Surgery is needed to know exactly how much
cancer is in the body.

Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is
determined by examining tissue removed
during surgery. An example might be pN2. If
you are given a cancer drug therapy before
surgery, then the stage might add a "y" and
look like ypT3. The pathologic (after surgery)
stage is based on information gained after
surgery to remove all or part of the tumor
and nearby lymph nodes. This gives a
more accurate picture of how far the cancer
has spread and is used to determine your
treatment options after surgery. The removal
of tumor tissue and nearby lymph nodes is an
important part of pathologic staging.

Lymph nodes in the head
and neck
There are over 300 lymph nodes
in the head and neck. Most
throat tumors spread to nearby
lymph nodes.

Throat cancer staging » TNM scores

TNM scores

Numbered stages
Numbered stages are based on TNM scores.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with
4 being the most advanced. They might be
written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III,
and stage IV.

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system
is used to stage throat cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different
areas of cancer growth. Based on imaging
and pathology results, a score or number
is assigned to each letter. The higher the
number, the larger the tumor or the more
the cancer has spread. These scores will be
combined to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM
example might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1,
N0, M0.

Other terms might be used instead of
numbered cancer stages.









T (tumor) – Depth and size of the main
(primary) tumor
N (node) – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes


M (metastasis) – If cancer has
spread to distant parts of the body or
metastasized

Throat cancer stages are based on if the
cancer is p16-positive (p16+) or p16-negative
(p16-). A p16+ cancer is one that is HPVrelated (HPV-mediated).

Resectable – Tumor can be removed
completely with surgery.
Unresectable – Tumor cannot be
removed completely with surgery. The
tumor might involve nearby veins and
arteries or other structures making it
unsafe to remove.
Locoregional or locally advanced
– This refers to a tumor that has spread
to tissue, organs, or lymph nodes in the
head and neck.
Moderately or very advanced
disease – Cancer that has spread to
parts of the neck such as the base of the
skull, larynx, pharynx, bones and muscles
behind the nasal cavity, jaw, and roof of
the mouth. It might include cancer in the
carotid artery.
Metastatic – Cancer that has spread
to other parts of the body, including lung
and distant lymph nodes. This might be
referred to as very advanced disease. Not
all stage 4 cancers are metastatic.

otolaryngologist, head and neck
surgeon, or surgical oncologist
who is an expert in head and neck
cancer before starting treatment.

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. When preparing
for surgery, you should seek the opinion of an
experienced otolaryngologist, head and neck
surgeon, or surgical oncologist with expertise
in head and neck cancer. The surgeon should
be an expert in performing your type of
surgery. Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating your type of cancer.

Goal of surgery
The goal of surgery is to remove all of the
cancer and keep your ability to function, such
as chew, swallow, breathe, and speak. During
surgery, the tumor is removed along with a
rim of normal-looking tissue around its edge
called the surgical margin. The surgical margin
may look normal but cancerous cells may
be found when viewed under a microscope
by a pathologist. A clear or negative margin
(R0) is when no cancer cells are found in
the tissue around the edge of the tumor. In
a positive margin, cancer cells are found in
normal-looking tissue around the tumor. Your
surgeon will look carefully for cancer not only
along the surgical margin, but in other nearby
areas. Despite best efforts, it is not always
possible to find all of the cancer. Sometimes,
surgeons can’t safely remove the tumor with a
cancer-free margin. Surgery includes removal
of lymph nodes. You may have more than one
surgery.

The removal of the cancer through surgery can
be accomplished in different ways depending
on the specific circumstances, such as the
size and location of the tumor, whether there
is cancer in any surrounding organs and
tissues, and your unique anatomy. Surgery is
based on the safest and best way to remove
cancer. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is
often offered to those with p16+ cancers who
are surgical candidates. TORS is a minimally
invasive, robotic surgery technique that
removes benign and malignant tumors of the
mouth and throat.
When planning for surgery, you should ask
how your breathing, swallowing, speaking,
chewing, and appearance might be affected.
Sometimes nerves might need to be cut
and sewn back together or removed as part
of cancer surgery. Lymph nodes are often
removed. This is the time to ask how your neck
and face might look after surgery and your
options about facial reconstruction surgery.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

After surgery, you may receive treatment such
as radiation or chemotherapy with radiation to
kill any remaining cancer cells.

Tumor resection



Surgery to remove the entire tumor is called
tumor resection. Sometimes, the whole tumor
cannot be removed. It depends on the tumor
location, what structures are involved, how
close it is to vital organs, and how function
(such as swallowing and speaking) will be
affected. The removal of lymph nodes is part of
tumor resection.

•

1A – Submental nodes

•

1B – Submandibular nodes

•



Neck lymph nodes







The head and neck contain a network of more
than 300 nodes. They are bound together
with muscles, nerves, and blood and lymph
vessels. Cancer can spread into these areas
and nearby lymph nodes. Throat cancer often
spreads to lymph nodes or lymph node groups
called chains.



There are 10 (X) levels or groups of lymph
nodes in the head and neck. Cervical lymph
nodes are found only in the neck. The 6
(VI) levels for neck lymph node groups are
described below. Lymph nodes from levels
2, 3, and 5 are at the greatest risk for throat
cancer metastasis.

2A and 2B are separated by the spinal
accessory nerve

Level 3 (III) – Middle Jugular Group
(the middle neck)
Level 4 (IV) – Lower Jugular Group (the
lower neck)
Level 5 (V) – Posterior Triangle Group
(the back portion of the neck)

•

38

1A and 1B are separated by the front
part of a neck muscle (digastric muscle)

Level 2 (II) – Upper Jugular Group (the
upper neck)
•

There are hundreds of lymph nodes
throughout your body. They work as filters to
help fight infection and remove harmful things
from your body. Lymph is a clear fluid that
gives cells water and food. It also helps to fight
germs. Lymph drains from lymph tissue and
travels through lymphatic vessels into lymph
nodes.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

Level 1 (I) – Submental and
Submandibular Group (under the jaw line)

Cricoid is the ring-shaped cartilage of
the larynx. A “U” or “L” may be used for
any N category to indicate metastasis
above the lower border of the cricoid (U)
or below the lower border of the cricoid
(L) in this group.

Treating throat cancer » Surgery

Lymph node surgery

There are 3 types of cervical (neck) lymph
node dissections:

The removal of lymph nodes or groups of
lymph nodes is called lymph node or nodal
dissection. It might be referred to as cervical
lymphadenectomy or neck dissection and is
part of tumor resection surgery. Lymph nodes
will be removed on the side of the neck where
the main (primary) tumor is found. When the
tumor is near the center of the neck (midline),
then lymph nodes from both sides will be
removed. The type of neck dissection is based
on tumor location and information gathered in
the pre-surgery (clinical) staging.

throat cancer metastasis.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

Selective neck dissection (SND)
removes some of the regional lymph
nodes where the cancer is likely to travel.
Comprehensive neck dissection
removes all lymph nodes in a group or
level.
Radical neck dissection removes all
lymph nodes, and may require removing
veins, arteries, nerves, or muscle next to
the nodes.

Treating throat cancer » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

For systemic therapy examples, see
Guide 5.

Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might
be used alone or with other therapies. Goals of
systemic therapy may be curative or palliative
and should be discussed before starting
treatment. The choice of systemic therapy
will be based on your individual needs. Your
wishes about treatment are important. Make
your wishes known.






Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
some normal cells. Sometimes, chemotherapy
drugs may be used in combination.
This is called multiagent chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy might be followed by radiation
therapy or chemoradiation.

When systemic therapy is given before
surgery or chemoradiation, it is called
neoadjuvant or induction therapy.

Chemoradiation
Treatment that combines chemotherapy with
radiation therapy is called chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy may improve how well radiation
works, and that is why they are sometimes
used together. For locally advanced disease,
the drug cisplatin is preferred with radiation.
Chemoradiation may be used to control
symptoms caused by a tumor.

When systemic therapy, chemoradiation,
or radiation therapy is given after surgery,
it is called adjuvant or postoperative
therapy.
When systemic therapy is given for
advanced or metastatic disease, it may be
called palliative therapy

Targeted therapy

For more information, see NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Immunotherapy Side Effects,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop or inhibit
the action of molecules that help cancer cells
grow and/or survive. If your tumor has certain
mutations, targeted therapy might be used. If
your tumor has a high number of mutations,
immunotherapy might be given.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment
that tries to re-activate the immune system
against tumor cells. The immune system
has many on and off switches. Tumors take
advantage of "off switches." Two leading off
switches are programmed cell death protein 1
(PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated
antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Immunotherapy can be
given alone or with other types of treatment.

Standard of care is the best-known
way to treat a particular disease
based on past clinical trials. There
may be more than one treatment
regimen that is considered standard
of care. Ask your care team what
treatment options are available and if
a clinical trial might be right for you.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

Treating throat cancer » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

Panoramic dental x-ray is part of a preradiation therapy dental evaluation. It is
needed to check the health of your jaw and
teeth to see if you need any dental work before
starting radiation therapy. It is important to tell
your dentist about your head and neck cancer
and to have regular dental cleanings and
checkups.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, electrons, and
other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink
tumors. RT may be used as main treatment
to cure cancer (curative treatment), or as
supportive care along with surgery or drug
therapy, or for palliative care to help ease pain
or discomfort caused by advanced cancer.
Most types of radiation include short treatment
sessions that are given once daily over a few
days to weeks. Each daily treatment takes
10 to 20 minutes. RT treatment can cause a
narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery, and
an RT dose to the carotid artery can increase
your risk for stroke. Ask your care team which
radiation option(s) are best for your situation,
if RT will be combined with chemotherapy, and
what side effects to expect.

Radiation therapy
External beam radiation
therapy (EBRT) uses a
machine outside the body
to aim radiation at the
tumor(s) or areas of the
body.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

42

Treating throat cancer » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

EBRT
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside the body to aim radiation at
the tumor(s) or areas of the body.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Common types of EBRT that may be used to
treat your cancer include the following:








Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses
computer software and CT images to aim
beams that match the shape of the tumor.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape
of the tumor. This limits the amount of
radiation to normal tissue.

Phases

Stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) uses high-energy
proton or photon beams to kill or ablate
the tumor. SBRT is very precise, which
reduces the chance of damage to nearby
tissues.

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.


Proton beam therapy (PBT) uses
proton beams to kill or ablate the tumor. It
is used as a second radiation option after
another type of radiation was used before.



Either IMRT (preferred) or 3D-CRT is often
recommended for throat cancer to minimize
radiation dose to critical structures.





NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Throat Cancer, 2024

43

Phase I trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase II trials study how well the drug
or approach works against a specific type
of cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or
approach against a standard treatment. If
the results are good, it may be approved
by the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Treating throat cancer » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, lab
tests, or general health. These requirements
ensure that participants are alike in specific
ways and that the trial is as safe as possible
for the participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
It depends on the study, your health insurance,
and the state in which you live. In general,
procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered
standard of care will be billed to you or
your insurance, whereas those considered
research are covered by the trial sponsor. Your
treatment team and the research team can
help determine if you are responsible for any
costs.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, then you
may not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Treating throat cancer » Supportive care

Supportive care

It is important to tell your care
team about all side effects so they
can be managed.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Supportive care might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you are
feeling and about any side effects so they can
be managed. Supportive care, best supportive
care, and palliative care often mean the same
thing.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers (caused by the
treatment itself). The sooner late effects are
treated the better. Ask your care team about
what late effects could occur. This will help you
know what to look for.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.
Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment.

Side effects

Survivorship

All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. When treatment
leads to remission (or no evidence of disease),
you will need follow-up or survivorship care for
late effects. During survivorship care you will
still have a care team, but it will look different.
Seek out peer support groups, whether online
or in person.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Side effects

the use of handheld fans directed at the face,
cooler temperatures, stress management,
relaxation therapy, and emotional and
psychosocial support. Depending on the
cause or type of discomfort, dyspnea might
be treated with systemic therapy, radiation
therapy (RT), medicine, or oxygen.

Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements, or more bowel movements
than usual. It is a common side effect of
chemotherapy. Diarrhea is treated with
prescription and over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, and food recommendations (like
eating rice or bread). Do not take any OTC
medicines without speaking to your care team
first. It is not unusual for diarrhea medicines to
cause constipation. Your care team will tell you
how to manage diarrhea and constipation. It is
important to drink lots of fluids.

Difficulty eating and loss of
appetite
Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or its treatment, and the stress of having
cancer might cause you to feel not hungry or
sick to your stomach (nauseated). You might
have a sore mouth or difficulty swallowing.
Healthy eating is important during treatment.
It includes eating a balanced diet, eating the
right amount of food, and drinking enough
fluids. A registered dietitian who is an expert
in nutrition and food can help. Weight loss is
common in those with head and neck cancer.
You might be asked to see a nutrition expert
before starting treatment to help prevent
severe weight loss.

Difficulty breathing
Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
(called dyspnea) is very common. How it
feels and the level of discomfort is different
for everyone. Non-drug therapies are
recommended such as

Treating throat cancer » Side effects

Difficulty swallowing or speaking

Keep a pain diary

Difficult swallowing (dysphagia) or painful
swallowing (odynophagia) can be caused
by treatment. Speech-language pathologists
(SLPs) can help people who have trouble
swallowing or speaking as a result of surgery
or radiation therapy.

A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicine that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Include in your pain diary:

3 The time and dose of all medicines
3 When pain starts and ends or lessens
3 Where you feel pain
3 A description of your pain. Is it

Fatigue

throbbing, sharp, tingling, shooting, or
burning? Is it constant, or does it come
and go?

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

3 Does the pain change at different times
of day? When?

3 Does the pain get worse before or

after meals? Does certain food or drink
make it better?

3 Does the pain get better or worse with
activity? What kind of activity?

3 Does the pain keep you from falling

asleep at night? Does pain wake you
up in the night?

3 A rating of your pain from 0 (no pain) to
10 (worst pain you have ever felt)

Lymphedema

Quality of life

Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph
fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.
It may be caused when part of the lymph
system is damaged or blocked, such as
during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment, or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression devices, and
other means.

Cancer and its treatment can affect your
overall well-being or quality of life (QOL).
Head and neck tumors often impact a person’s
ability to function such as chew, swallow,
speak, and breathe. They can also impact
taste, smell, hearing, how your voice sounds,
or how you look. It is very important that you
are well-prepared and understand how surgery
or radiation therapy might cause changes to
these functions and your appearance.
For more information on quality of life, see
NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Palliative Care
at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

Pain
Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain. Some people may benefit from
palliative radiation therapy to help relieve pain.
During this treatment, a radiation beam is
focused on the tumor or metastasis.

Tumor samples are tested for the p16 protein
to see if HPV infection is present. This is a key
part of staging (finding out if and how much
the cancer has spread) and is considered
when making treatment decisions. Also,
there are some new blood tests that can help
personalize care in HPV-positive cancers.
This information can help predict the likely

Follow-up care
After treatment, you will be monitored for
side effects and the return of cancer called
recurrence. General follow-up care includes
doctor visits, blood and imaging tests, and
supportive care as needed. It is important to
contact your doctor right away if you notice
any changes in your head or neck. For general
follow-up care, see Guide 7.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

less and cancer may be in 1 lymph node.
In locally advanced cancer, the tumor may
be any size and cancer may be in 1 or
more lymph nodes. The tumor might have
grown into the larynx (voice box) or other

Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,

Surgery is an option
A resectable tumor can be removed with
surgery. If surgery is done, it might be followed
by radiation therapy (RT), chemoradiation,
or a clinical trial. A clinical trial is preferred in
some cases. Surgery is not the only option
for a resectable tumor, particularly if the
surgery is anticipated to affect swallowing or
speaking. In these cases, other options include
chemoradiation or systemic therapy followed
by RT or chemoradiation.

Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Best supportive care,
supportive care, and palliative care are often
used to mean the same thing.

An unresectable tumor cannot be removed
with surgery because it is too close to vital
organs. Sometimes, an unresectable tumor

Metastatic disease

Key points

Metastatic disease is cancer that has spread
through the bloodstream to distant areas
of the body. A clinical trial is preferred for
metastatic disease. Depending on your overall
health, your ability to perform activities of
daily living (ADLs), your preferences about
treatment, and the location and number of
metastases, treatment options also include
systemic therapy, surgery, radiation therapy,
or chemoradiation. Palliative surgery and
palliative radiation therapy along with other
types of supportive care might be given to
relieve pain, discomfort, swallowing difficulties,
and side effects caused by cancer. For
systemic therapy options, see Guide 8.

Advanced throat cancer or very advanced
cancer is cancer that remains after
treatment (persistent cancer) or cancer
that has returned after a cancer-free
period (recurrence). It also includes
cancer that cannot be removed with
surgery (unresectable) or cancer that
has spread to near (locoregional) or
distant (metastatic) sites through the
bloodstream.
Treatment is based on the size and
location of the tumor(s), if there is cancer
in the lymph nodes, and what treatment
you had before. Your overall health and
preferences about treatment are also
important.
A resectable tumor can be removed
with surgery. An unresectable tumor
cannot be removed with surgery
because it is too close to vital organs.
Sometimes an unresectable tumor can
become resectable after treatment with
chemoradiation, radiation therapy, or
systemic therapy.
Metastatic disease is cancer that has
spread through the bloodstream to
distant areas of the body. A clinical trial is
preferred for metastatic disease.

choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest
conversation with your care team.

Second opinion
It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
