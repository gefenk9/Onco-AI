About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Version 2.2024 – March 22, 2024.

Your blood contains different types of cells that
float in plasma. Plasma is a clear, yellowish
fluid made up of mostly water. More than half
of your blood is plasma and the rest is made
up of blood cells.

in the stem cells of bone marrow.
There are many subtypes of AML
found in adults. This chapter will
provide an overview of AML.

There are 3 types of blood cells:



Blood
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of
blood cancer. Blood is a tissue. A tissue is a
group of cells that work together to perform a
function. Blood’s function is to move oxygen
and nutrients throughout the body and carry
away waste. Blood also plays an important
role for the immune system and in preventing
bleeding.



White blood cells (leukocytes), which
include granulocytes (neutrophils),
monocytes, lymphocytes, and others
Platelets (thrombocytes)

Blood cells have important jobs. Red blood
cells (RBCs) carry oxygen throughout
the body. White blood cells (WBCs) fight
infections. Platelets (PLTs) help control
bleeding. Blood cells are being replaced in
your body all the time. Many have a short
lifespan. Some white blood cells live less than
one day. Your body makes one million red
blood cells every second!

Blood stem cells
Bone marrow
contains stem
cells. A blood
stem cell is an
immature cell that
can develop into
a red blood cell,
white blood cell,
or platelet.

1 AML basics » Blood

How blood cells are formed

AML starts in the blood stem cells and makes
abnormal myeloblasts, also called blasts or
leukemia cells.

Bone marrow is the organ that creates blood
in our body. Bone marrow is the sponge-like
tissue in the center of most bones. Inside your
bone marrow are early blood-forming cells
called blood (hematopoietic) stem cells. Stem
cells multiply so we have enough supply for
our lifetime. Some of those stem cells also
gradually turn into blood cells. This process is
called differentiation.

Blasts
A blast is an immature white blood cell.
Blasts are committed to becoming a type of
blood cell. Lymphoblasts normally mature
into lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.
Myeloblasts are responsible for all other nonlymphoid blood cells in bone marrow, such as
granulocytes (another type of white blood cell).

At any given time, bone marrow will have cells
in various stages of development, from very
immature to almost fully mature. After a blood
stem cell develops into a red blood cell, white
blood cell, or platelet, it is released in your
bloodstream as needed.

blood stem cell

Blood cell formation
All blood cells start
as blood stem cells. A
blood stem cell has to
mature or go through
many stages to become
a red blood cell, white
blood cell, or platelet.
AML affects the myeloid
progenitor cells, which
develop into red blood
cells, granulocytes (a
type of white blood cell),
and platelets.

Acute myeloid leukemia

Key points

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), changes
stop myeloid blasts (or myeloblasts) from
becoming mature blood cells. As a result, there
is a buildup of blasts in the bone marrow and
blood. In turn, there are not enough healthy
red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells.
This causes serious health issues. For this
reason, AML is fatal if left untreated.





Traditionally, to be diagnosed with AML, 20
percent (20%) or more myeloblasts must be
present in the marrow or blood. This means
that at least 1 out of every 5 marrow cells are
blasts. However, myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) can also have increased blasts. As a
result, MDS with 10% to 19% blasts is called
MDS/AML. In certain cases, a diagnosis of
AML is possible with any number of blasts,
particularly if certain gene mutations or
abnormal chromosomes are also present.







Subtypes of AML
There are many subtypes of AML. They are
grouped and treated based on the presence
or absence of certain gene mutations or
abnormal chromosomes and other factors.
Treatment chapters in this book are divided
into:

AML starts in the blood stem cells and
makes abnormal myeloblasts, also called
blasts or leukemia cells.
Changes stop myeloid blasts from
becoming mature blood cells. As a result,
there is a buildup of blasts in the bone
marrow and blood making it hard for
blood to do its work.
A traditional diagnosis of AML requires
that 20 percent (20%) or more myeloid
blasts must be present in the bone
marrow or blood. This means that at least
1 out of every 5 marrow cells are blasts.
In certain cases, a diagnosis of AML
is possible with any number of blasts,
particularly if certain gene mutations or
abnormal chromosomes are also present.
There are many subtypes of AML. They
are grouped and treated based on gene
mutations and other factors.

leukemia (AML). This chapter
presents an overview of possible
tests you might receive and what
to expect.

Test results


Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and
treat AML. A diagnosis of AML is based on the
presence of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow
or blood. The number of blasts required to be
diagnosed with AML can vary. Traditionally, the
number of blasts must be 20 percent (20%)
or more. This means that at least 1 out of
every 5 marrow cells are blasts. However, a
diagnosis of AML is possible with any number
of blasts, particularly if certain gene mutations
or abnormal chromosomes are also present.



Unlike other cancers of organs, like lung
cancer or breast cancer, AML does not have
stages. Instead, testing looks for specific gene
mutations or abnormal chromosomes, which
can tell your care team how aggressive your
leukemia might be.



Results from blood tests, bone marrow
aspirate and biopsy, and imaging studies will
be used to guide your treatment plan. It is
important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions about your test results.
Online patient portals are one way to access
your test results. Please wait to discuss the
results with your doctor or health care team.

It's beneficial to have a support system
in place during diagnosis and treatment.
Enlist the help of friends, family members,
or peers who can provide transportation,
meals, and emotional support. These can
be different people for different tasks or
change over time.
Consider bringing someone with you to
doctor visits if possible, or have someone
on the phone or join you for telehealth
visits.
Don't hesitate to ask questions and take
notes during appointments. Write down
questions and ask a friend or family
member to take notes.
Organize your medical documents,
including insurance forms, medical
records, and test results. Keep a list of
contact information for your care team
and update your primary care physician
(PCP) regarding any changes. Include
details about the specific type of cancer,
treatment, and dates in your contact list.
Set up a MyChart or health record
account if it’s available, which can
help you track your appointments and
communicate with your care team.
Remember, in many places the MyChart
or portal messages are not immediately
seen by a nurse or physician, so ask your
care team how best to communicate with
them, especially in an emergency.

2 Testing for AML » General health tests

For possible tests and procedures, see

a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Guide 1.

Family history

General health tests

Some cancers and other diseases can run in
families. Your doctor will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members on both sides of
your family about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what
age they were diagnosed. It’s important to
know the specific type of cancer, or where the
cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations.
Those with a family history of leukemia,
blood cancer or abnormalities, or certain
genetic mutations might be referred to genetic
counseling.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
(OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you
take. Some supplements interact and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called

Physical exam

Blood clotting tests

During a physical exam, your doctor may:

Your body stops bleeding by turning blood into
a gel-like form. The gel-like blood forms into
a solid mass called a blood clot. Clotting is a
process or series of events. Proteins, called
coagulation factors, are needed for clotting.
They are made by the liver. These tests are
known together as a coagulation panel or
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
panel.



Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat





Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched

It is standard to screen for clotting problems.
An impaired clotting process is common in
leukemia. This is called coagulopathy. You
may have bleeding and bruises.

Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin

Blood urea nitrogen
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a waste product
filtered out of the blood by the kidneys. A high
level of BUN can be a sign your kidneys aren’t
working well.

Blood tests
Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into a vein. Be
prepared to have many blood tests during AML
treatment and recovery to check treatment
results, blood counts, and the health of organs
like your liver and kidneys.

Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a
test that measures 14 different substances in
your blood. It is usually done on the plasma
part of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.

Tests described next are listed alphabetically
and not in order of importance.

B12 and folic acid

Complete blood count and
differential

Vitamin B12 and folic acid (folate) work with
vitamin C to help the body make new proteins.
They are needed for normal red blood cell
(RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) formation.
B12 and folic acid levels will be monitored. You
may be given vitamin supplements, if needed.

A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your
blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a picture
of your overall health. AML often causes low
counts of healthy blood cells, but it can also

2 Testing for AML » Blood tests

Electrolytes

present with a high number of abnormal,
malignant (abnormal) white blood cells.

Electrolytes help move nutrients into cells
and help move waste out of cells. Electrolytes
are ions or particles with electrical charges
that help the nerves, muscles, heart, and
brain work as they should. Your body needs
electrolytes to function properly. Phosphate
(PO4), a type of electrolyte, is important for
strong bones and teeth. Too much phosphate
in blood can be a sign your kidneys aren’t
working well.

There are several types of white blood cells. A
differential counts the number of each type of
white blood cell. It also checks if the counts are
in balance with each other. This test may show
a high number of blasts in the blood.
Your care team will pay particular attention to
the following CBC measurements:








Hemoglobin (Hgb) is a measurement of
how much oxygen can move through
blood and if a red blood cell transfusion
might be needed.

Iron
Iron is important in maintaining body functions
such as producing hemoglobin, the molecule
in your blood that carries oxygen. You might
be monitored for low levels of iron called iron
deficiency. You may be given an intravenous
(IV) iron supplement, if needed. It is possible
to have too much iron in the body called
overload. Therefore, only take what is
prescribed by your doctor.

Platelets (PLT) are cells that make the
clot, thus preventing or stopping the
bleeding.
Absolute neutrophils (ANC) are the cells
that fight with bacteria and protect us from
infections.
Blasts or leukemia cells can sometimes
be detected in the blood and usually are
reported as a percentage of cells.

Lactate dehydrogenase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is a protein found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into blood. Fastgrowing cells also release LDH. High levels of
LDH can be a sign of AML.

Creatinine
Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles.
Every person generates a fixed amount of
creatinine every day based on how much
muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the
blood tells how well the kidneys are working.
Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys
aren’t working as well as they were when
someone had lower levels of creatinine.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 2024

Liver function tests
Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that are
made or processed by the liver. Levels that
are too high or low signal that the liver is not
working well.

12

2 Testing for AML » Blood tests

Phosphate
Cells have a lot of phosphate in them.
Therefore, when many cells are breaking down
at the same time, the levels of phosphate in
the blood can go up. Your kidneys help get rid
of extra phosphate, but too much phosphate
in the blood can also damage the kidneys,
making it harder to get the levels back down to
normal.

Be prepared to have many
blood tests.

HLA typing
A human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a protein
found on the surface of most cells. It plays
an important role in your body’s immune
response. HLAs are unique to each person.
They mark your body’s cells. Your body
detects these markers to tell which cells are
yours. In other words, all your cells have the
same set of HLAs. Each person’s set of HLAs
is called the HLA type or tissue type.

Uric acid
Uric acid is released by cells when DNA
breaks down. It is a normal waste product
that dissolves in your blood and is filtered
by the kidneys where it leaves the body as
urine. Too much uric acid in the body is called
hyperuricemia. With AML, it can be caused by
a fast turnover of white blood cells. High uric
acid might be a side effect of chemotherapy or
radiation therapy. Very high levels of uric acid
in the blood can damage the kidneys.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 2024

HLA typing is a test that detects a person’s
HLA type. This test is done before a donor
(allogeneic) blood stem cell transplant, also
called a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).
To find a donor match, your proteins will be
compared to the donor’s white blood cells to
see how many proteins are the same. A very
good match is needed for a transplant to be
a treatment option. Otherwise, your body will
reject the donor cells or the donor cells will
react against your body. Blood samples from
you and your blood relatives will be tested first.

13

2 Testing for AML » Performance status » Bone marrow tests

Performance status

Bone marrow tests

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be rated
using a PS scale called Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG). PS is one factor
taken into consideration when choosing
a treatment plan. Your preferences about
treatment are always important.

A diagnosis of AML is often confirmed using
a bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow
biopsy. Your bone marrow is like a sponge
holding liquid and cells. An aspirate takes
some of the liquid and cells out of the sponge,
and a biopsy takes a piece of the sponge. A
bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are often
done at the same time.

The ECOG PS scores are as follows:

Leukemia starts in the bone marrow. To
diagnose AML, samples of bone marrow must
be removed and tested before starting any
treatment. Your sample should be reviewed by
a pathologist who is an expert in the diagnosis
of AML. This review is often referred to as
histology, histopathology, or hematopathology
review. The pathologist will note the overall
appearance and the size, shape, and type of
your cells.










PS 0 means the person is fully active.
PS 1 means the person is still able to
perform light to moderate activity, but with
some limitations.
PS 2 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed less than half of the time and
still able to care for self.
PS 3 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed more than half of the time.

A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is a
bedside procedure. It is not a surgery and
does not require an operating room. Your care
team will try to make you as comfortable as
possible during the procedure. The samples
are usually taken from the back of the hip bone
(pelvis). You will likely lie on your belly or side.
For an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed
through your skin and into the bone. Liquid
bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe.
For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to
remove a small piece of bone. You may feel
bone pain at your hip for a few days. Your skin
may bruise.

PS 4 means the person is totally confined
to the bed or chair and completely unable
to care for self.

Good PS is usually PS 0 or PS 1.

If the blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell
neoplasm (BPDCN) subtype of AML is
suspected, you might also have a lymph
node biopsy or a skin lesion biopsy.

Flow cytometry

Immunophenotyping

Flow cytometry (FCM) is a laboratory method
used to detect, identify, and count specific
cells. Flow cytometry involves adding a lightsensitive dye to cells. The dyed cells are
passed through a beam of light in a machine.
The machine measures the number of cells,
things like the size and shape of the cells, and
other unique features of cells.

Immunophenotyping is a process that uses
antibodies to detect the presence or absence
of white blood cell antigens called biomarkers.
These antigens are proteins that can be
found on the surface of or inside white blood
cells. Certain biomarkers are targeted in AML
treatment.

Immunohistochemistry

A complete blood test can count the number
of white blood cells, but it cannot detect the
subtle differences between different types
of blood cancers. Flow cytometry can detect
these subtle differences. The most common
use of flow cytometry is in the identification of
markers on cells, particularly in the immune
system (called immunophenotyping).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to cells. The cells are then
studied using a microscope. IHC looks for the
immunophenotype of cells from a biopsy or
tissue sample.

Bone marrow aspirate
and biopsy
Samples of bone and
marrow are removed in a
biopsy.

Testing for AML biomarkers
and genetic changes

Leukemia predisposition
syndromes
Some hereditary cancer syndromes can be
passed down from biological parent to child. A
family history of leukemia can affect treatment.
A skin punch biopsy might be done if a
predisposition condition is suspected. If your
blood was tested at diagnosis, you would see
the genetic changes of the leukemia. However,
these may not be the genetic changes you
were born with. Therefore, a skin punch biopsy
is used. In this procedure, a small piece of
skin and connective tissue is removed to get
DNA that hasn’t been altered by AML. This
will be used to see if you inherited genes that
increase your risk of leukemia.

Biomarker testing includes tests of genes or
their products (proteins) and identifies the
presence or absence of mutations and certain
proteins that might suggest the leukemia
subtype. Genetic and biomarker tests are used
to learn more about your type of AML, to target
treatment, and to determine the likely path
your cancer will take (prognosis). This genetic
testing is different from family history genetic
testing and genetic cancer risk testing. AML
genetic testing looks for changes only in the
leukemia cells that have developed over time,
and not changes in the rest of your body’s
cells. It is sometimes called molecular testing,
tumor profiling, gene expression profiling, or
genomic testing.

Leukemia predisposition syndrome can affect
how your body responds to treatment. Blood
and saliva can be used when AML cells
disappear (in remission). Biological family
members who are possible hematopoietic
stem cell donors might be tested for leukemia
predisposition syndrome.

Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total
of 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome
contains thousands of genes. Genes are
coded instructions for the proteins your cells
make. Most genes contain information about a
specific protein. A mutation is when something
goes wrong in the genetic code. Proteins
are given names such as FLT3. Genes are
identified in italics like this: FLT3.

While it can be confusing, just know that
testing done to look for an inherited gene
(germline) mutation or an inherited risk of
cancer is different than genetic testing done
specifically on cancer cells or testing to look for
proteins produced by cancer cells.


AML cells sometimes have changes in genes
and chromosomes that can be seen under a
microscope or found with various other tests.


Testing of your leukemia cells can gather
specific information about your leukemia
to help guide treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Testing of cells not affected by your
leukemia (like skin) can help tell if you
have a leukemia predisposition syndrome.

2 Testing for AML » Testing for AML biomarkers and genetic changes

AML mutation testing

all the different types of mutations or how they
happen.

A sample of your blood or bone marrow will
be studied to see if the AML cancer cells have
any specific mutations. This is separate from
the genetic testing for mutations that you may
have inherited from your biological parents.

Karyotype
A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes.
Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
A karyotype will show extra, missing
(deletion), translocated, or abnormal pieces of
chromosomes within the leukemia cells. Since
a karyotype requires growing cells, a sample of
bone marrow or blood must be used.

AML cells can have changes in genes
and chromosomes. Mutation testing using
methods such as karyotype, fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), and next-generation
sequencing (NGS) are used to look for these
changes or abnormalities. Some mutations
may determine the type of treatment given.
There are several different methods by which
your blood and bone marrow will be tested for
mutations. It is not important for you to know

FISH

AML genetic changes

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. FISH
can look for changes (abnormalities) that are
too small to be seen with other methods. It
can only be used for known changes. Since
this test doesn’t need growing cells, it can be
performed on either a bone marrow or blood
sample. Sometimes, a bone marrow sample is
needed to get all the information the care team
needs to help plan your treatment.

AML cells can have changes in genes
and chromosomes. Mutation testing
looks for these changes or abnormalities
that are unique to AML cells. Examples
of such changes are called deletion,
insertion, amplification, translocation
(rearrangement), and point mutation.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions
of copies of one's DNA or RNA (genetic
information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find
1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000
normal cells. These copies, called PCR
product, might be used for next-generation
sequencing (NGS). This is important when
testing for treatment response or remission.
A real-time or reverse transcriptase (RT)
is a type of PCR used to look for gene
rearrangements such as PML::RARA. This
aids in diagnosis and monitoring response to
targeted therapies.

gene is changed

3 Chromosome translocation

and gene rearrangement
– Switching of parts between 2
chromosomes. When described at
the chromosome level, it is called
a translocation. When described
at the gene level, it is called
rearrangement. For example,
the chromosome translocation is
written as t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) and its
gene rearrangement is written as
RUNX1::RUNX1T1.

Next-generation sequencing
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a
method used to determine a portion of a
person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene
has any mutations that might affect how the
gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more
detailed way than other methods and can find
mutations that other methods might miss.

2 Testing for AML » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

Brain CT
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture.
A CT of the brain is used to look for bleeding.
Contrast should not be used. This is a very
quick test.

In some cases, imaging tests may be
performed. It is based on your individual
situation. Imaging tests take pictures of the
inside of one's body to look for sites with
leukemia outside the bone marrow. Leukemia
can spread outside the bloodstream to lymph
nodes, liver, spleen, and skin. It rarely spreads
to the lining of the brain and spinal cord.
Imaging tests can also show areas of infection
or bleeding that may impact your care.

Brain MRI
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays or any radiation. A device will
be placed around your head that sends and
receives radio waves. An MRI can show if the
outer layer of the brain is swollen. Swelling
caused by leukemia is called leukemic
meningitis. Contrast should be used.

A radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will interpret the test and send the
report to your doctor. The doctor will discuss
the results with you. While these reports are
available to you through your portal, please
wait to discuss these results with the doctor.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that
help enhance and improve the images of
several organs and structures in the body.
It is used to make the pictures clearer.
Contrast might be taken by mouth (oral) or
given through a vein (IV). The contrast is not
permanent and will leave the body in one’s
urine after the test. The types of contrast
vary and are different for CT and MRI. Not all
imaging tests require contrast, but many do.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it. Also, tell your doctor if there is any
metal in your body. MRI scans take longer to
perform than CT scans.

PET scan

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 2024

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans because they use sugar more

quickly than other cells. However, not all
cancer cells will appear on a PET scan. Also,
not all bright spots are cancer. It is normal for
the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be
bright on PET. Inflammation or infection can
also show up as a bright spot. When a PET
scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/
CT scan. An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer
called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).

An echocardiogram (or echo) uses sound
waves to make pictures of your heart. For
this test, small patches will be placed on your
chest to track your heartbeat. Next, a wand
(called a transducer) with gel on its tip will be
slid across part of your bare chest. A picture
of your beating heart will be seen on a screen.
The pictures will be recorded for future viewing
and interpreted by a cardiologist.

Heart tests

An echocardiogram is one way of measuring
ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood
pumped out of the left side of your heart every
time it beats. This is used to evaluate the
function of your heart. In low ejection fraction,
the amount of blood pumping from the left side
of the heart is lower than normal.

Certain treatments can affect heart (cardiac)
function. Heart tests are used to see how
well your heart works. These tests such as
an echocardiogram (echo) or multigated
acquisition (MUGA) scan may be needed as
a baseline before giving chemotherapy or to
monitor treatment side effects. You might be
referred to a cardiologist.

MUGA
A multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan is
another way to evaluate the pumping function
of your heart. During the test, a small amount
of radiotracer will be injected into a vein. A
special camera, called a gamma camera, will
create computer-generated movie images of
your beating heart.

Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows
the electrical activity in your heart. It reveals
information about your heart rate, rhythm, and
electrical conduction. Prolonged corrected
QT interval (or QTc) occurs when your heart
muscle takes longer than normal to recharge
between beats. An ECG is used to detect
this. Certain treatments for AML can cause
prolonged QTc. If the QTc becomes too
prolonged, it can cause dangerous heart
rhythms.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 2024

A MUGA scan might show low ejection
fraction. This is when the amount of blood
pumping from the left side of the heart is lower
than normal.

2 Testing for AML » Lumbar puncture

Lumbar puncture
Leukemia can travel to the fluid that surrounds
the spine or brain. This may cause symptoms
such as headaches, neck pain, and sensitivity
to light. To know if leukemia cells are in your
spinal fluid, a sample must be taken and tested
to rule out a central nervous system (CNS)
disease. A lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure
that removes spinal fluid. It is also called a
spinal tap. Lumbar punctures are not common
in AML.

Testing takes time. It might take
days or weeks for all test results
to come in.

Results from blood tests, bone marrow
aspirate and biopsy, and imaging studies
will determine your treatment plan.
An aspirate or biopsy is the removal of
a sample of tissue or group of cells for
testing. A diagnosis of AML is confirmed
using a bone marrow aspirate and bone
marrow biopsy.
Genetic and biomarker tests are used
to learn more about your type of AML,
to target treatment, and to determine
the likely path your cancer will take
(prognosis).
HLA typing should be done in those
with newly diagnosed AML for whom
allogeneic (donor) hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT) is an option.
Imaging tests are used to look for sites
of infection, bleeding, and leukemia
that might have spread outside the
bloodstream.
Heart or cardiac tests might be needed to
test how well your heart works.
A lumbar puncture (LP) may be done to
look for leukemia in spinal and brain fluid.



treatment is to put the cancer
in remission. This chapter
provides an overview of possible



treatments and what to expect.
Together, you and your care team
will choose a treatment plan that


is best for your subtype of AML.

Care team



Treating AML takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.







Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout cancer treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it. Get to know
your care team and help them get to know you.





Depending on your diagnosis, the care team
might include the following specialists:


A hematologist or hematologic
oncologist is a medical expert in blood
diseases and blood cancers. Other types

A stem cell transplant specialist
oversees the transplantation process,
from evaluation to post-transplant care.
A pathologist or hematopathologist
analyzes the cells and tissues removed
during a biopsy and provides cancer
diagnosis. You may never meet this
physician in person.
Oncology nurses provide your
hands-on care, like giving systemic
therapy, managing your care, answering
questions, and helping you cope with side
effects.
Oncology pharmacists are experts in
knowing how to use and dose medicines
to treat cancer and to manage symptoms
and side effects.
Palliative care specialists
concentrate on preventing and alleviating
suffering and improving quality of life.
Nutritionists and dietitians can
provide guidance on what foods are most
suitable for your condition.
An occupational therapist helps
people with the tasks of daily living.
A physical therapist helps people
move with greater comfort and ease.
Psychologists and psychiatrists
are mental health experts who can help
manage issues such as depression,
anxiety, or other mental health conditions
that can affect how you think and feel.

Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional issues. The anxiety a
person feels when diagnosed with cancer
might be managed by a social worker
in some cancer centers. They, or other
designated professionals, can help
navigate the complexities of financial and
insurance stresses.
Spiritual care specialists identify and
support those with spiritual distress or
unmet spiritual needs.
A research team helps to collect
research data and coordinate care if
you are in a clinical trial. Clinical trials
help bring new therapies to patients and
advance the treatment for everyone.
Consider asking your care team about
access to clinical trials.

Standard of care is the best-known
way to treat a particular disease
based on past clinical trials. There
may be more than one treatment
regimen that is considered standard
of care. Ask your care team what
treatment options are available and if
a clinical trial might be right for you.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 2024

3 Treating AML » Systemic therapy » Chemotherapy

Systemic therapy

Chemotherapy

Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might
be used alone or with other therapies. Goals
of systemic therapy should be discussed
before starting treatment. Your preferences
about treatment are important. If you have any
religious or personal beliefs about certain kinds
of treatment, now would be the time to share
them with your care team.

Chemotherapy is the standard of care for
treating AML. Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing
cells throughout the body, including cancer
cells and normal cells. You will be monitored
throughout treatment for side effects or
other unwanted (adverse) reactions. All
chemotherapy drugs may cause severe, lifethreatening, or fatal reactions.
Chemotherapy is most often a liquid that is
slowly injected into a vein with a needle. The
final dose differs between people because it is
based on body weight.

You will likely get either a catheter or a port
to deliver systemic therapy, fluids, and blood
products into your body. A catheter is a thin,
long tube that is often placed in the chest. This
goes into a large vein and stays there until
treatment is complete. A port is a small, round
disc that is usually placed in the chest. The
type and location of catheter or port will be
tailored to your needs and treatment plans.

In most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles
of treatment days followed by days of rest.
This allows the body to recover before the
next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending on
which chemotherapy is used. You might spend
time in the hospital during treatment.

Types of chemotherapy
There are many types of chemotherapy
used to treat AML. Often chemotherapies
are combined. This is called multi-agent
chemotherapy or a multi-agent regimen. Each
chemotherapy works in a different way and
causes different side effects. Talk to your care
team about the types of chemotherapy you will
be given, when you will get them, and what
side effects to expect.

Antimetabolites

There are different doses for cytarabine
(Ara-C):

Antimetabolites prevent the building blocks of
DNA from being used. Examples include:

High (HiDAC)



Clofarabine (Clolar)



Intermediate



Cytarabine



Low (LDAC)



Fludarabine



Methotrexate

The dose you will receive is based on many
factors. Ask your care team for the details of
your treatment.

Anthracyclines
Anthracyclines damage and disrupt the
making of DNA causing cell death of both
cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Some
anthracyclines can cause heart issues. They
may not be an option for you. There is a limit
to how much you can receive in your lifetime.
Anthracycline examples include daunorubicin,
idarubicin (Idamycin PFS), and mitoxantrone
(Novantrone). Dual-drug liposome of
cytarabine and daunorubicin (CPX-351 or
Vyxeos) includes an antimetabolite and an
anthracycline.

Will I need to spend time in the hospital?
If so, for how long?

Cytarabine or methotrexate may be used
to treat AML in the fluid that surrounds the
spine or brain. In this case, it is injected into
the spinal fluid. This is called intrathecal
chemotherapy.

Hypomethylating agents

Cytarabine

Methyl groups are molecules that are found in
DNA. They can turn genes on or off. Leukemia
cells often have too many methyl groups.
These extra groups can block genes from
being turned on and off. Hypomethylating
agents (HMAs) block methyl groups from
binding to DNA. They turn silenced genes back
on, which allows leukemic blasts to mature
into normal cells. Azacitidine (Vidaza) and
decitabine are HMAs.

Cytarabine is an anthracycline. Cytarabine
(also called Ara-C) is used in many treatment
regimens. It might be used alone or in
combination with other drugs. It might be given
as a single dose to reduce a very high white
blood cell count.

3 Treating AML » Targeted therapy

Targeted therapy

CD33
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is a type
of targeted therapy that is linked to a
chemotherapy drug. It attaches to a cell
surface protein called CD33, then enters the
cell. Once inside, chemotherapy is released.
Many leukemic blasts have CD33 proteins.
Mature blood cells do not have CD33 and
are not affected. GO may delay blood count
recovery and cause liver issues.

Targeted therapy is a form of systemic therapy
that focuses on specific or unique features of
cancer cells. Targeted therapies seek out how
cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the
body. These drugs stop the action of molecules
that help cancer cells grow and/or survive.
You will be monitored throughout treatment
for side effects or other unwanted (adverse)
reactions. As with other systemic therapies,
targeted therapy may cause severe, lifethreatening, or fatal reactions.

Core binding factor
Core binding factor (CBF) creates a shortage
of all types of mature blood cells. Gemtuzumab
ozogamicin might be used in combination with
daunorubicin and cytarabine to treat AML with
CBF or other genetic abnormalities.

Some examples of targeted therapies:

3 Treating AML » Clinical trials

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

3 Treating AML » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
Rarely. It depends on the study, your health
insurance, and the state in which you live. Your
treatment team and the research team can
help determine if you are responsible for any
costs.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

3 Treating AML » Hematopoietic cell transplant

Hematopoietic cell
transplant

Transfusions are also possible. A red blood cell
transfusion is used to prevent bleeding and
to treat anemia (below normal red blood cell
count). A platelet transfusion is used to treat
a low platelet count or bleeding. While waiting
for the cells to engraft, you will likely feel tired
and weak.

A hematopoietic stem cell is an immature cell
that can develop into any type of blood cell. A
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) replaces
hematopoietic stem cells that have been
destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/
or radiation therapy as part of the transplant
process. You might hear it called a stem cell
transplant (SCT) or a bone marrow transplant
(BMT). This book will refer to it as HCT. HCTs
are performed in specialized centers.

The goal of the transplant is for the new
immune system to recognize what remains of
the leukemia as foreign and destroy it and to
provide you with new, healthy bone marrow.

Possible side effects

Allogeneic transplant

Every treatment has side effects. You will be
monitored for infections, decreases in your
blood counts that require blood transfusions,
disease relapse, and graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD). In GVHD, the donor cells attack your
normal, healthy tissue. There are treatments
for GVHD. Ask your care team about the
possible side effects or complications of HCT
and how this might affect your quality of life.

An allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(allogeneic HCT) uses healthy stem cells
from a donor. The donor may or may not be
related to you. Before an HCT, treatment is
needed to destroy bone marrow cells. This is
called conditioning and it creates room for the
healthy donor stem cells. Your blood will be
in a weakened state after conditioning until
the donor stem cells settle in and take over
as your new blood supply. Conditioning also
weakens the immune system so your body
won’t kill the transplanted cells. Chemotherapy
is used for conditioning.

More information on GVHD can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

After conditioning, you will receive a
transfusion of the healthy stem cells from a
donor matched to you. A transfusion is a slow
injection of blood products into a vein. This
can take several hours. The transplanted
stem cells will travel to your bone marrow
and grow. New, healthy blood cells will form.
This is called engraftment. It usually takes
about 2 to 4 weeks. Until then, you will have
little or no immune defense. You may need to
stay in a very clean room at the hospital or be
given antibiotics to prevent or treat infection.

3 Treating AML » General supportive care

General supportive care

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
these effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care that relieves
symptoms caused by cancer or its treatment
and improves quality of life. It might include
pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual
support, financial aid, or family counseling. Tell
your care team how you are feeling and about
any side effects so they can be managed. Best
supportive care, supportive care, and palliative
care often mean the same thing.

Survivorship

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. AML treatment can cause a
number of side effects. Some are very serious.

A personalized survivorship care plan will
contain a summary of possible long-term
effects of treatment called late effects and list
follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care
provider will coordinate with specialists for your
follow-up care.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Cancer can cause blood clots to form. This
can block blood flow and oxygen in the body.
Blood clots can break loose and travel to other
parts of the body causing breathing problems,
stroke, or other problems.

You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

Diarrhea

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how to
manage diarrhea. It is important to drink lots of
fluids.

over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.

Fatigue
Fatigue is a state of physical or mental
tiredness or weakness that can be
characterized by a lack of energy, motivation,
or stamina. Fatigue may be caused by cancer
or it may be a side effect of treatment. Let your
care team know how you are feeling and if
fatigue is getting in the way of doing the things
you enjoy. Eating a balanced diet, exercise,

Neutropenia is very common during leukemia
treatment. It is a low number of white blood
cells and can lead to frequent or severe
infections. When someone with neutropenia
also develops a fever, it is called febrile
neutropenia (FN). With FN, your risk of
infection may be higher than normal. This is
because a low number of white blood cells
leads to a reduced ability to fight infections.
FN is a side effect of some types of systemic
therapy. Let your care team know immediately
if you are neutropenic and develop a fever.

Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infections that
could be dangerous.
Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

Loss of appetite
Sometimes side effects from cancer or its
treatment, and the stress of having cancer
might cause you to feel not hungry or sick
to your stomach (nauseated). You might
have a sore mouth or difficulty swallowing.
Healthy eating is important during treatment.
even when you don’t have an appetite or
get pleasure from eating. It includes eating
a balanced diet, eating the right amount of
food, and drinking enough fluids. A registered
dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food
can help. Speak to your care team if you have
trouble eating or maintaining weight.

Anemia is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to
your cells. You might tire easily if you are
anemic.

Neuropathy
Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment. Most of the
time, neuropathy goes away after treatment.

Neurotoxicity
Some treatments can damage the
nervous system (neurotoxicity) causing
problems with concentration, memory,
and thinking. Seizures and confusion can
occur.

Supportive care resources
More information on supportive care is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer

Pain
Tell your care team about any pain
or discomfort. You might meet with a
palliative care specialist or with a pain
specialist to manage pain.

Palliative care
Palliative care is appropriate for anyone,
regardless of age, cancer stage, or the
need for other therapies. It focuses on
physical, emotional, social, and spiritual
needs that affect quality of life (QOL).

Quality of life
Cancer and its treatment can affect your
overall well-being or quality of life (QOL). For

A treatment plan is based on your
age and other factors such as your
overall health and performance status.
Performance status is your general level
of fitness.

All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called
side effects. It is important to
tell your care team about all of
your side effects so they can be
managed.

Systemic therapy works throughout
the body. AML is treated with systemic
therapy.
A hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
aims to restore the body's ability to
produce normal blood cells by replacing
cancerous bone marrow stem cells with
healthy stem cells.
A clinical trial is a type of research that
studies a treatment to see how safe it is
and how well it works.
Supportive care is health care that
relieves symptoms caused by cancer or
its treatment and improves quality of life.
Supportive care is always given.
All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important for you to tell your
care team about all your side effects so
they can be managed.
It is very important to take care of yourself
during treatment by eating well, drinking
plenty of fluids, exercising, and doing
things that make you feel energized.

Treatment phases

AML. Together, you and your care
team will choose a treatment plan

The goal of the induction phase of treatment
is to put AML into complete remission. In
complete remission, both bone marrow and
blood cell blasts are suppressed, allowing
normal marrow function to resume. However,
undetected leukemia cells may persist and can
return causing relapse. Consolidation therapy,
another phase, is needed to prolong remission.

that is best for you.

Overview
There are different types of AML. Most people
with leukemia do not have acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL). This chapter is for those with
non-APL AML.

There are different types of treatment
responses. When there are no signs of
cancer, it is called a complete response (CR)
or complete remission (CR). This does not
always mean that AML has been cured—
there can still be undetectable leukemia cells.
Remission can be short-term (temporary) or
long-lasting (permanent). Partial remission
(PR) and a complete response with partial
hematologic (CRh) or incomplete (CRi) blood
recovery are also possible. Ask your care team
what these terms might mean for your type of
AML.

Diagnosis
To be diagnosed with AML, myeloblasts must
be present in the bone marrow or blood.
At diagnosis, most people will have a bone
marrow aspirate and biopsy. Some may have
a lumbar puncture if there are signs and
symptoms of central nervous system (CNS)
leukemia.

It takes time for bone marrow to make normal
blood cells again. This is called recovery. In
hypoplasia, bone marrow is starting to recover,
but hasn't fully recovered yet.

What causes AML?
AML can happen for certain known reasons,
but very often there is no clear cause that
can be determined. Certain treatments for
other cancers, such as radiation or a certain
type of chemotherapy, can later cause AML.
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or other
chronic marrow cancers can become AML.
MDS is a type of cancer that occurs when
bone marrow stops making enough healthy

Measurable or minimal residual
disease

In complete remission:






There is no sign of leukemia after
treatment.

In measurable or minimal residual disease
(MRD) very sensitive lab tests, such as PCR,
find leukemia cells in your bone marrow. When
testing finds MRD, it is called a positive MRD
result or MRD positive (MRD+). Ask your care
team what this might mean and what the next
steps will be.

Your blood counts have returned to
normal.
You have less than 5 percent (5%) blasts
in your bone marrow (or fewer than 5
blasts out of every 100 blood cells).

Consolidation

Treatment for AML can occur over years. The
several phases are described next.

Your blood will be given time to recover before
starting consolidation. Consolidation is the
second phase of treatment. It is also called
post-remission therapy. Consolidation treats
blasts that may have survived induction.
Consolidation may be done to prevent relapse
while waiting for hematopoietic cell transplant
(HCT).

Induction
Induction is the first phase of treatment. It is
also called remission induction. The goal is to
reduce the number of blasts and put AML in
remission. As the number of blasts decreases,
other types of marrow cells will also decrease.
Your marrow will need time to recover, about 4
to 6 weeks, so blood cells can return to normal
levels. Treatment attempts to restore the
process of making normal blood cells. When
blood counts are normal, bone marrow tests
will be repeated to see if the leukemia is in
remission.

Monitoring
You will have frequent blood tests during
induction and consolidation. Bone marrow
tests are possible.

Maintenance

If treatment does not reduce the number
of blasts, you may receive more treatment
called re-induction. If blasts persist after more
induction, treatment options can be found in
Relapsed and refractory disease on page 46.

For some people, maintenance is the final
phase of treatment. The goal is to prolong
remission, and the treatment may be received
for months to years.

Surveillance
Surveillance watches for any changes in your
condition after remission or an hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT). You will have tests
during surveillance to check for relapse.

4 AML » Treatment overview

Treatment overview
AML is not treated the same for everyone.
As the body ages, it can have difficulty
tolerating higher doses or more intense cancer
treatments. In addition to age, your overall
health, general level of fitness (performance
status), and genetic risk play a role in
treatment decisions. Some cancers like AML
are treated more aggressively than others. An
intensive therapy might have more side effects
or be of a higher dose than a less intensive
therapy. An intensive therapy is not necessarily
better. Remission or a complete response (CR)
is still possible in lower-intensity treatments.

We want your
feedback!
Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.
Take our survey to let us know
what we got right and what we
could do better.

There are always risks with treatment. Talk
with your care team about the risks and why a
certain treatment might be better for you. Find
out how treatment might affect your quality and
length of life. Your preferences about treatment
are also important.

Risk groups
ELN2022 refers to the system developed by
the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) in 2022
specifically for AML. This system categorizes
those with AML into different risk groups
based on various factors such as age,
cytogenetics (chromosomal abnormalities),
molecular genetics (gene mutations), and
response to initial treatment. The purpose of
this risk classification is to help health care
professionals predict the likely course of
the disease (prognosis) and tailor treatment
strategies accordingly. The ELN2022 risk
classification system assists by identifying
persons at high-risk who may benefit from
more aggressive therapies and persons at lowrisk who may require less intensive treatment.

Maintenance

Actionable mutations include IDH1, IDH2,
and FLT3. Treatment options can be found in

Guide 5.

Not everyone will receive maintenance
therapy. If given, it will likely be azacitidine, a
chemotherapy. For those who had an HCT,
then maintenance might be a targeted therapy.

After induction
Your next round of induction will be based
on which therapy you had first and how AML
responded to treatment. Treatment options are
based on the amount of cancer or blasts that
that remain after induction called measurable
or minimal residual disease (MRD). In
hypoplasia, bone marrow is starting to recover,
but hasn't fully recovered yet. A lumbar
puncture might be done. Further treatment is
based on if there was a complete response
(CR) or less than a complete response to
induction.




Surveillance
Surveillance is a period of testing that begins
after remission to monitor for relapse or the
return of cancer. During surveillance, you will
have a complete blood count (CBC) every 1 to
3 months for 2 years. After that, a CBC should
be repeated every 3 to 6 months for up to 5
years. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy may
be needed.

If there was a complete response
(remission), then treatment might be a
cytarabine-based therapy, a continuation
of a previous therapy, or a hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT). A clinical trial is also
an option, if available and it is what you
want.
If there was less than a complete
response or cancer progressed,
then options include chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, a clinical trial, an HCT,
or best supportive care. Best supportive
care is treatment to improve quality of life
and relieve discomfort.

When leukemia returns it is called a
relapse. The goal of treatment is to achieve
remission again. You may receive treatment
to prevent the blasts from spreading to your
brain and spine. A search for a blood stem
(hematopoietic) cell donor should begin at first
relapse, if this is an option being considered.

Supportive care
Supportive care aims to improve your quality
of life. It includes care for health issues caused
by cancer or cancer treatment. It is sometimes
called palliative care.
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Some side
effects are very serious. Ask your treatment
team for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects.

Transfusions
A transfusion is a common procedure to
replace blood or blood components (red
blood cells or platelets). It is given through
an intravenous line (IV), a tiny tube that is
inserted into a vein with a small needle.

Before treatment, your white blood cell
count may be very high. A high count can
cause severe health issues. Apheresis or
hydroxyurea can quickly reduce the count.
Apheresis is a procedure in which blood is
collected, certain types of cells are removed,
and your blood is returned to your body.

safe. Donated blood is carefully tested,
handled, and stored.

In those with AML receiving a blood
transfusion, most of the white blood cells will
be removed from donor blood. If treatment

donor blood will also be treated with radiation.
These steps will help prevent donor blood
from attacking your body. They will also help
prevent infections.

If you do not want blood transfusions, your

Differentiation syndrome

for supportive care during consolidation if you
have a life-threatening infection. Filgrastim
(Neupogen) is a G-CSF.

Differentiation syndrome is a potentially
serious side effect of taking certain anti-cancer
drugs. It is caused by a large, fast release of
cytokines (an immune protein) as the leukemia
cells respond to treatment. Differentiation
syndrome used to be called retinoic acid
syndrome.




A biosimilar or substitute might be used in
place of filgrastim. A biosimilar is almost an
identical drug made by another company. It is
used in the exact same way and at the same
dose as filgrastim.

Symptoms include fever, swelling in limbs,
and trouble breathing. You can also gain
weight and get a skin rash.

Infections
If not treated early, infections can be fatal.
Infections can be caused by viruses, fungus,
or bacteria. Antibiotics can treat bacterial
infections. Antifungal medicines can treat
fungal infections. You may be given drugs to
prevent infections.

Signs include low blood pressure and a
decrease in blood oxygen levels. Fluid
can build up around your lungs or heart.
Damage to your kidneys and liver may
occur.

Treatment must be started at the first signs
or symptoms. Steroids are one effective
option for treatment. If there is a rising white
blood cell count with differentiation, then an
antimetabolite called hydroxyurea (Hydrea) is
also frequently used.

Tumor lysis syndrome
In tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), waste released
by dead cells builds up in the body causing
kidney damage and severe blood electrolyte
disturbances. TLS can be life-threatening.
Induction chemotherapy may cause TLS. TLS
is more likely if your blast count is very high.

Eye issues
High-dose cytarabine may cause the white
part of your eyes to become red. Your eyes
may feel painful and make more tears. These
issues may be prevented with saline or steroid
eye drops.

Growth factors
Growth factors, called granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF), trigger the bone
marrow to make granulocytes (white blood
cells). It is sometimes part of an aggressive
chemotherapy regimen for relapsed or
refractory cancer. Growth factors are an option

In most cases, the causes of APL are not
known. Sometimes, certain treatments for
other cancers can cause what is known as
therapy-related APL.

Overview

Treatment phases

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a
rare subtype of AML. About 1 out of every 10
people with AML have APL. Without treatment,
APL can worsen quickly and be fatal. With
treatment, APL is cured more often than other
AML subtypes. APL is treated with all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA) in combination with
another systemic therapy.

Treatment phases for APL include induction
and consolidation. Treatment might take
place over a period of years. Some types of
treatment may be harmful to your heart. Before
treatment, your doctor may test how well your
heart is working. You may receive treatment for
your heart, too.
Treatment response may be measured in the
following ways:

Diagnosis
The initial diagnosis of APL may be confirmed
by a test such as fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) or polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). APL can be diagnosed quickly,
and treatment can be started within just a few
hours.







APL usually occurs when parts of chromosome
15 and chromosome 17 break off and trade
places, called translocation. This translocation
is written as t(15;17). It makes two genes that

A hematologic response measures
your blood cell counts.
A morphologic response measures
the number of blasts and abnormal cells.
A cytogenetic response measures
your chromosomes.
A molecular response measures your
molecules (genes).

5 APL » Overview

Induction

Consolidation

Induction is the first phase of treatment. The
goal is to reduce the number of blasts and put
APL into remission. Treatment is sometimes
called remission induction because the
focus of induction is remission or a complete
response (CR).

Consolidation is the second phase of
treatment. It treats blasts that may have
survived induction. Often, consolidation uses
the same drugs as before. Consolidation can
cause a long-lasting molecular response. You
may have a lumbar puncture before starting
consolidation.

In complete remission, there are no signs
or symptoms of cancer. It might be more
specifically described by the type of remission,
such as morphologic or molecular remission.
There are different types of complete response
or remission. They are described below.






A morphologic complete response
occurs when less than 5 percent (5%)
blasts are found. This means that less
than 5 out of every 100 bone marrow cells
are blasts. Induction usually causes a
large drop in the number of blasts.
A cytogenetic complete response
happens when the translocation of
chromosomes 15 and 17 or t(15;17) is no
longer found, but the PML::RARA gene
might still be found.
A molecular complete response
will likely follow a cytogenetic response.
A molecular response is defined as the
absence of the PML::RARA gene. This
means the PML::RARA gene is not found.
Often, more treatment (consolidation) is
needed to achieve a molecular response.

Treatment needs time to work. Your blood
needs time to recover. Blood marrow samples
will be taken before starting consolidation.
Tests will look for blasts in the marrow. If blasts
are absent, induction can be stopped to allow
your marrow to make more blood cells.

5 APL » Treatment overview » Low-risk group

Treatment overview

Low-risk group

Unlike other types of AML, APL is treated with
all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Often, ATRA
is combined with arsenic trioxide. These
treatments are specific to APL. Gemtuzumab
ozogamicin (GO), a targeted therapy, might be
given. Chemotherapy may also be used.

Those with a white blood cell count of 10
x 109/L (10 billion) or less at diagnosis are
placed into the low-risk group. For low risk,
the preferred induction therapy option is ATRA
with arsenic trioxide. Consolidation will include
ATRA with arsenic trioxide.

ATRA

If arsenic trioxide is not an option, ATRA with
idarubicin or gemtuzumab can be used for
induction therapy. Consolidation will be a
continuation of induction therapy and might
include mitoxantrone.

ATRA is made in the body from vitamin A, but
it is also made in a lab to treat acne and APL.
This drug is also called a retinoid. Retinoid
forces APL blasts to mature and become
normal cells.

It takes time for blood to recover. You might
have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate
before starting consolidation.

Retinoid is an effective treatment for APL.
Used by itself it can achieve a complete
response (remission) in most people. However,
this response is short-lived. Therefore, other
treatments must be added to achieve better
results.

Arsenic trioxide (Trisenox)
Arsenic trioxide (or ATO) causes the death
of APL cells. When added to ATRA, arsenic
trioxide improves treatment outcomes. This
means more leukemia cells die and relapse
occurs in fewer people. Your heart and
electrolytes will be monitored during treatment
with arsenic trioxide.

5 APL » High-risk group » Monitoring

High-risk group

There are 2 types of heart issues that affect
treatment:

Those with a white blood cell count of more
than 10 x 109/L (10 billion) at diagnosis are
placed into the high-risk group.



Treatment for high risk is based on if you have:



No heart issues or heart disease
Heart issues such as low ejection fraction
or prolonged QTc



Treatment for high risk is based on those with
and without heart issues or heart disease. In
all groups, ATRA is used as part of induction
therapy. After induction, a bone marrow
aspirate and biopsy will be done to look for and
confirm remission. A lumbar puncture might be
done.

Prolonged QT interval (or QTc)
occurs when your heart muscle takes
longer than normal to recharge between
beats. Often, this electrical disturbance
can be seen on an electrocardiogram
(ECG).

Monitoring
After completing maintenance therapy, you
will enter a monitoring phase. Monitoring is a
prolonged period of testing to look for signs
that APL has returned, called relapse. PCR
tests will be done. Bone marrow or blood
samples might be used. You will have no drug
therapy during this time.

No heart issues
For high risk without heart issues, the
preferred induction therapy option is ATRA with
arsenic trioxide and either a chemotherapy
(idarubicin or cytarabine) or targeted therapy
(gemtuzumab). Consolidation will be a
continuation of induction therapy and might
include mitoxantrone.

High risk with heart issues
For high risk with heart issues such as heart
disease, induction options are based on
the type of heart issue. All induction options
include ATRA. Other systemic therapies might
be added. Consolidation will be a continuation
of induction therapy. A lumbar puncture is
possible.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 2024

Low ejection fraction is when
the amount of blood pumping from
the left side of the heart is lower than
normal. This is measured using a
multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or
echocardiogram.

55

5 APL » Relapse

Relapse
APL can return after remission. A relapse
is possible after either a morphologic or
molecular response. In relapse after molecular
response, the PML::RARA gene has returned.
You will have bone marrow and genetic tests
to confirm you have relapsed APL and not AML
caused by previous treatment (called therapyrelated AML).

You know your body
better than anyone.
Help your care team understand:

Treatment for first relapse APL will be based
on your prior therapy and if it is:




3 How you feel
3 What you need
3 What is working and what is not

Early relapse (less than 6 months after
treatment)

Keep a list of names and contact
information for each member of your
team. This will make it easier for you
and anyone involved in your care to
know whom to contact with questions
or concerns.

Late relapse (6 or more months after
treatment)

The goal of treatment is to achieve remission
again. This is not always possible.

Second therapy

Get to know your care team
and help them get to know
you.

After first relapse treatment is complete, your
next therapy will be based on if remission was
achieved.






If remission, then the options are a
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT),
arsenic trioxide, or a clinical trial.
You may receive chemotherapy to prevent
APL from spreading to your brain and
spine (central nervous system or CNS).
If no remission, then the options are
clinical trial or HCT (matched sibling or
another donor).

5 APL » Supportive care

Supportive care

Bleeding
APL can cause bleeding, or coagulopathy,
that can be fatal. Your blood will be tested to
see how well it clots. Bleeding can usually
be managed with platelet transfusions,
cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma.
Cryoprecipitate comes from thawed frozen
blood.

Supportive care aims to improve your quality
of life. It includes care for health issues caused
by cancer or cancer treatment. It is sometimes
called palliative care. Palliative care is
appropriate for anyone, regardless of age,
cancer stage, or the need for other therapies.
It focuses on physical, emotional, social, and
spiritual needs that affect quality of life (QOL).
Tell your treatment team about any new or
worsening symptoms.

Differentiation syndrome
Differentiation syndrome is caused by a large
release of cytokines (immune substances)
from leukemia cells. Anti-cancer drugs used to
treat APL may cause differentiation syndrome.
Symptoms of differentiation syndrome include
fever, swelling in limbs, and trouble breathing.
Weight gain and a skin rash are possible.
Signs of differentiation syndrome include
low blood pressure and a decrease in blood
oxygen. Fluid can build up around your lungs
or heart. Damage to your kidneys and liver
may occur. This syndrome can be fatal if not
caught early.

Supportive care for APL is described next.

Arsenic trioxide monitoring
Arsenic trioxide can cause serious irregular
heart rhythms (arrhythmias). You will be
monitored for a prolonged QT interval. In
prolonged QT, the heart muscle takes longer
than normal to recharge between beats. This
electrical disturbance often can be seen on an
electrocardiogram (ECG).

Seek out support groups at
your local hospital, through
social media, or from those
listed in the back of this
book. Look to friends,
relatives, neighbors, and
coworkers for social
support.

Overview



Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm
(BPDCN) is cancer of the immature
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (blasts), a type
of immune cell. These blood cells start in
the bone marrow and travel to the lymphatic
organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes.
Skin lesions are common. BPDCN can also
affect the central nervous system (CNS).

Enlarged lymph nodes
Stomach pain caused by the disease in
the spleen
Fatigue caused by a decrease in normal
blood cells

What causes BPDCN?
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) can become
BPDCN. MDS is a type of cancer that occurs
when bone marrow stops making enough
healthy blood cells and abnormal cells are
present. MDS starts in the blood stem cells of
bone marrow.

BPDCN occurs in all races. It is often
misdiagnosed because the symptoms and
signs vary greatly, and the disease is rare.
Therefore, ideally, your treatment team
should include doctors from different fields of
medicine who are experts in BPDCN.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 2024

Skin lesions that might be dark purple
and large or small spots across the
skin. It might look like a rash or bruises.
Everyone is different.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)
can become BPDCN. CMML is a slowgrowing type of MDS or myeloproliferative
neoplasm (MPN) in which there are too many
myelomonocytes, a type of white blood cell, in
the bone marrow.

Testing and diagnosis

Treatment overview

BPDCN is very difficult to diagnose. It is very
important for an expert hematopathologist
to review a biopsy when there is concern for
BPDCN.

BPDCN is a difficult disease to treat. Treatment
decisions should involve a multidisciplinary
team of doctors from different fields of
medicine, including a dermatologist, who are
experienced in treating BPDCN.

Almost everyone with BPDCN gets skin
lesions. BPDCN is often found through a skin
biopsy after a visit to the dermatologist for
skin lesions. A dermatologist is an expert in
the skin. BPDCN may be diagnosed through a
lymph node or bone marrow biopsy.

Treatment for BPDCN includes tagraxofusperzs (preferred) or high-dose chemotherapy
followed by hematopoietic cell transplant
(HCT). Not everyone can tolerate this
approach. BPDCN usually returns (relapses)
soon after treatment.

Biomarker and genetic testing will be done to
confirm BPDCN and to look for any mutations.
Some common gene mutations include ET2,
ASXL1, ZRSR2, SRSF2, TP53, NRAS, IDH2,
and ETV6.
For possible tests and procedures, see

Guide 7.

Possible tests and procedures: BPDCN
Medical history and physical exam

this treatment. Tagraxofusp-erzs can cause
harmful side effects.

The goal of intensive therapy is to put
BPDCN into remission (to achieve a complete
response [CR]). Intensive therapy is not for
everyone. Treatment will be based on factors
such as your overall health and your body’s
ability to tolerate drug therapies that could
be toxic. Your wishes are also important. Talk
with your care team about what to expect from
treatment and what you want from treatment.

The first cycle of this drug should be given
in a hospital where it is recommended you
stay for at least 24 hours after the treatment
is complete. This is to monitor for toxicity and
to treat side effects. You will probably spend
more than one week in the hospital.

Chemotherapy
There are 3 chemotherapy induction options:

Tagraxofusp-erzs (preferred)
Tagraxofusp-erzs (Elzonris) is a biologic
therapy. A biologic is made from a living
organism or its by-product like in a vaccine. It
helps to improve the body’s natural response
against cancer.

Cytarabine with idarubicin or daunorubicin



HyperCVAD



Tagraxofusp-erzs targets the CD123 protein
marker found at higher levels on BDPCN
cancer cells. This leads to cancer cell death.
You must be in good overall health to receive

CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone)

In hyperCVAD chemotherapy, treatment
alternates between two groups of drugs. Hyper
means chemotherapy is given in smaller
doses and more often to minimize side effects.

Your preferences about
treatment are always
important. If you have any
religious or personal beliefs
about certain kinds of
treatment, share them with
your care team and make
your wishes known.

6 BPDCN » No intensive therapy

No intensive therapy

CVAD stands for the first group of drugs:
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin
(also known by its trade name, Adriamycin),
and dexamethasone. The second group of
drugs consists of methotrexate and cytarabine.
Sometimes, other drugs are added.

If intensive therapy is not an option, then
treatment options are based on whether
BPDCN is systemic or localized. In both cases,
treatment is to palliate or to give relief.

Complete remission

Localized disease

After a complete response (CR), options are
to continue tagraxofusp-erzs until disease
progression or consider a hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT). After an HCT, you will enter
surveillance. Surveillance is a plan that closely
watches your condition. You might hear it
called watch-and-wait. During this time, you
will have tests on a regular basis to look for
changes in your blood. You will not have any
treatment during surveillance.

If BPDCN is found only in the skin or isolated
to a certain area of the body, then treatment
will focus on those areas. It might include
radiation therapy to the lesion(s) or surgery to
remove lesions.

Systemic disease
Systemic means the cancer is throughout the
body. Treatment includes venetoclax-based
therapy, systemic steroids, and supportive
care. Venetoclax-based therapy is a lowintensity targeted therapy.

Surveillance includes a complete blood count
(CBC) every 1 to 3 months for 2 years, then
every 3 to 6 months for up to 5 years. You
might have a bone marrow aspirate and
biopsy. You might also have an FDG-PET/CT
if you had extramedullary disease before. This
is cancer that might be in the lymph nodes or
other organs. Skin or other lesions might be
biopsied.

Less than complete remission
If BPDCN does not seem to be responding
to treatment or there is less than a complete
response, then it will be treated as refractory
disease. If the skin still shows microscopic
disease (CRc), you might have more cycles (at
least 4) of therapy before starting treatment for
refractory disease.

was not used before. Other options include
systemic therapy or radiation. See Guide 8.

When leukemia returns, it is called a relapse.
The goal of treatment is to achieve remission
again. You may receive treatment to prevent
the blasts from spreading to your brain and
spine. Relapse is common in BPDCN. Not
everyone's cancer responds to treatment in the
same way.

Supportive care
Supportive care is health care that relieves
your symptoms caused by cancer and
improves your quality of life. It is not cancer
treatment. In BPDCN, supportive care might
include radiation therapy or surgery to treat
skin lesions. Everyone with BPDCN should
have a dermatologist as part of their care
team.

When leukemia does not respond to treatment
or progresses during treatment, it is called
refractory or resistant cancer. The cancer may
be resistant at the start of treatment or it may
become resistant during treatment.

A clinical trial is the preferred treatment for
relapsed and refractory BPDCN. Tagraxofusperzs (Elzonris) is also a preferred option if it

Tagraxofusp-erzs
Tagraxofusp-erzs can have very serious side
effects. You will have blood tests to closely
monitor your health. Capillary leak syndrome
and hypoalbuminemia are serious and lifethreatening conditions that can occur if you
take tagraxofusp-erzs.





Capillary leak syndrome
Tagraxofusp-erzs injection may cause a
serious and life-threatening reaction called
capillary leak syndrome. In capillary leak
syndrome, fluid and proteins leak out of tiny
blood vessels causing dangerously low blood
pressure. This may lead to organ failure and
death. You will be monitored for capillary
leak syndrome. You might be asked to weigh
yourself every day while taking tagraxofusperzs. Sudden weight gain might be a sign of
capillary leak syndrome.

Hypoalbuminemia
Hypoalbuminemia is a medical sign that
protein levels of albumin are too low in the
blood. It is most often the result of capillary
leak syndrome.
