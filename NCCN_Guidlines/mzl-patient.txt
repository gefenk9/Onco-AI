About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for B-Cell Lymphomas Version 1.2024 – January 18, 2024.

1 Lymphoma basics » Lymphocytes » Marginal zone lymphomas

As lymph travels throughout your body, it
passes through hundreds of small beanshaped structures called lymph nodes. Lymph
nodes make immune cells that help the body
fight infection. They also filter the lymph fluid
and remove foreign material such as bacteria
and cancer cells.

of plasma cells are multiple myeloma and not
lymphoma.

Marginal zone lymphomas
Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is a common
type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). MZL
is considered a slow-growing (indolent)
lymphoma. It forms in B-cell lymphocytes that
live in the marginal zone part of the spleen,
lymph nodes, or lymphoid tissues. Lymphoid
or lymph tissues are organized structures that
support immune responses. They are where
lymphocytes are found. Examples include
bone marrow, thymus, and tonsils.

Lymphocytes
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer
of lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type of
white blood cell that helps fight and prevent
infection. Lymphocytes are found in blood
and lymph tissue, and every organ in the
body. Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels
and lymph nodes. Lymphocytes normally
grow in response to infection or inflammation.
When they grow on their own without proper
regulation, they can develop into lymphoma.

The marginal zone is a very active area that
receives large amounts of circulating blood.
Here, blood interacts with different types of
white blood cells that engulf and digest cancer
cells, microbes, cellular debris, and foreign
substances. When abnormal marginal zone
B cells grow out of control, then marginal
zone lymphoma develops. Chronic infection,
inflammation, or autoimmune disorders might
cause some types of MZL due to the increased
activity in the immune system. But, in most
cases, the cause of MZL is unknown.

There are 3 main types of lymphocytes:






B lymphocytes or B cells make
antibodies. An antibody is a protein.
T lymphocytes or T cells help fight
infections, kill tumor cells, and control
immune responses.
Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor
cells or virus-infected cells.

MZL can be divided into 3 distinct subtypes:


Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can develop from
B-cell, T-cell, or NK-cell lymphocytes.
Marginal zone lymphoma starts in mature B
cells. B cells mature into plasma cells, which
produce antibodies that are used to attack
invading bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The
antibody molecules latch onto and destroy
invading viruses or bacteria by recruiting other
components of the immune system. Cancers

MZL has some features that overlap with
another type of lymphoma called Waldenström
macroglobulinemia (WM), also known as
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). In WM,
bone marrow produces too many abnormal
white blood cells that crowd out healthy blood
cells.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). H. pylori can
also cause stomach ulcers.
Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma
or immunoproliferative small intestinal
disease occurs in young adults in eastern
Mediterranean countries. It often forms in
the abdomen. Those with this type of EMZL
may also be infected with bacteria called
Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni). Treatment
options specific to this type are not covered in
this book.

For more information, read NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Waldenström Macroglobulinemia,

Cutaneous Lymphomas, available at NCCN.
org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Extranodal MZL
Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL)
is the most common form of MZL. It is called
extranodal because it forms outside the lymph
nodes in places such as the stomach (gastric),
small intestine, salivary glands, thyroid, eyes,
breast, skin (cutaneous), or lungs. Each type
is based on location. EMZL found in the skin is
called cutaneous MZL.
In the past, the term mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma was used
to describe this type of MZL. Now, EMZL is
the preferred term because it more accurately
describes all possible EMZL disease sites.
EMZL can be caused by certain types of
infection, inflammation, or autoimmune
disorders of the affected organ. The most
common location for EMZL is the stomach,
where it is often caused by the bacteria

Nodal MZL

Splenic MZL

Nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) forms
in and is mostly limited to the lymph nodes.
Lymph nodes make immune cells that help
the body fight infection. They also filter the
lymph fluid and remove foreign material such
as bacteria and cancer cells. This type of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is also called
monocytoid B-cell lymphoma.

Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL)
involves the spleen, blood, and bone marrow.
The spleen makes immune cells, filters the
blood, stores blood cells, and removes old
blood cells. The most common sign of SMZL
is an enlarged spleen. This type of MZL
is sometimes associated with hepatitis C
infection.

Extranodal MZL
The diagram shows the
most common sites
for extranodal MZL.
Extranodal MZL accounts
for about 6 out of every 10
cases of MZL per year.

2 Testing for MZL » Test results » General health tests

Accurate testing is essential to



diagnose and treat marginal zone
lymphoma (MZL). This chapter
presents an overview of possible



tests you might receive and what
to expect.

Test results
Results from biopsy and imaging studies will
be used to determine your treatment plan.
Treatment will be based on these findings. It
is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions and keep copies of your
test results. Online patient portals are a great
way to access your test results. Please discuss
your results with your doctor or health care
team.









Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.

Set up a MyChart or health record
account if it’s available, which will
help you track your appointments and
communicate with your care team.

Some general health tests are described next.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called

Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.
Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Marginal Zone Lymphomas, 2024

Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.
They are great partners in your care.
In your contact list, include information on
the exact type of cancer you have, as well
as any treatments you've received and
the date each treatment started.

General health tests

Keep these things in mind:


Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.

2 Testing for MZL » Fertility (all genders)

Fertility (all genders)

a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect
your fertility, the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might change your fertility. To preserve your
fertility, you may need to take action before
starting cancer treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options
before starting treatment.

Family history
Marginal zone lymphoma is not inherited
from your biological parents. However, some
cancers and other diseases can run in families.
Your care team will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members on both sides of
your family about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what
age they were diagnosed. It’s important to
know the specific type of cancer or where the
cancer started, if it is in multiple locations, and
if they had genetic testing.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t sure at the
moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists
can help you sort through what may be best for
your situation.

Physical exam

More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

During a physical exam, your doctor may:


Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat





Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched

Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin

2 Testing for MZL » Preventing pregnancy during treatment » Performance status

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment

Those with testicles
Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth
control) such as condoms to prevent
pregnancy during and immediately after cancer
treatment.

Cancer and cancer treatment can affect the
ovaries and damage sperm. If you become
pregnant during chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or other types of systemic therapy,
serious birth defects can occur. Speak with
your care team about preventing pregnancy
while being treated for cancer. Hormonal birth
control may or may not be recommended,
so ask your doctor about options such as
intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier
methods. Types of barrier methods include
condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the
contraceptive sponge.

Performance status
Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be
rated using a PS scale called ECOG (Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group). PS is one
factor taken into consideration when choosing
a treatment plan. Your preferences about
treatment are always important.

Those with ovaries
Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing
baby if you are or become pregnant during
treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding at the time of your cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.

The ECOG PS scores range from 0 to 5.





Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
period may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended during and after treatment.
Consult your doctor for the best time to plan a
pregnancy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Marginal Zone Lymphomas, 2024



PS 0 means the person is fully active.
PS 1 means the person is still able to
perform light to moderate activity, but with
some limitations.
PS 2 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed less than half of the day and
still able to care for self.
PS 3 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed more than half of the day.
PS 4 means the person is totally confined
to the bed or chair and completely
disabled.
PS 5 means the person is not alive.

Good PS is usually PS 0 or PS 1.

2 Testing for MZL » Blood tests

Blood tests

aren’t working as well as they were when
someone had lower levels of creatinine.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein. Be
prepared to have many blood tests during MZL
treatment and recovery to check treatment
results, blood counts, and the health of organs
like your liver and kidneys.

Electrolytes
Electrolytes help move nutrients into cells
and help move waste out of cells. Electrolytes
are ions or particles with electrical charges
that help the nerves, muscles, heart, and
brain work as they should. Your body needs
electrolytes to function properly.

Complete blood count and
differential

Helicobacter pylori

A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your
blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a picture
of your overall health. A differential counts the
number of each type of WBC (neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and
basophils). It also checks if the counts are in
balance with each other.

Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori is a type of
bacterium that causes inflammation and ulcers
in the stomach or small intestine. People
with H. pylori infections may be more likely
to develop cancer in the stomach, including
extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL).

Hepatitis B and hepatitis C

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures 14 different substances in your
blood. It is usually done on the plasma part
of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.

Hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV)
are types of liver disease caused by a virus.
A hepatitis blood test will show if you had
hepatitis in the past or if you have it today.
Some cancer treatments can wake up (or
reactivate) the virus. If this happens, it can
cause harm to the liver. People with HCV may
be more likely to develop splenic marginal
zone lymphoma (SMZL).

Creatinine

HIV

Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles.
Every person generates a fixed amount of
creatinine every day based on how much
muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the
blood tells how well the kidneys are working.
Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
An HIV antibody test checks for HIV antibodies
in a sample of blood, urine, or saliva. It’s
important to let your doctor know if you have
ever been infected with HIV.

2 Testing for MZL » Blood tests

HLA typing

Infections related to MZL

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a protein
found on the surface of most cells. It plays
an important role in your body’s immune
response. HLAs are unique to each person.
They mark your body’s cells. Your body
detects these markers to tell which cells are
yours. In other words, all your cells have the
same set of HLAs. Each person’s set of HLAs
is called the HLA type or tissue type.

Certain infections can cause ongoing
(chronic) inflammation and increased activity
of the immune system. Infections such as
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), Chlamydia
psittaci (C. psittaci), Campylobacter jejuni (C.
jejuni), Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi),
and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been found
in those with MZL. These infections are
different from infections that can be a result of
treatment.

HLA typing is a blood test that detects a
person’s HLA type. This test is done before
a donor (allogeneic) hematopoietic cell
transplant. To find a donor match, your proteins
will be compared to the donor’s proteins to
see how many proteins are the same. A very
good match is needed for a transplant to be
a treatment option. Otherwise, your body
will reject the donor cells or the donor cells
will react against your body. Blood or tissue
samples from you and your blood relatives will
be tested first.

Lactate dehydrogenase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is a protein found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into the blood.
Fast-growing cells also release LDH and
cause levels of this protein to be elevated in
the blood.

Pregnancy test
If planned treatment might affect pregnancy,
then those who can become pregnant will
be given a pregnancy test before treatment
begins.

Immunoglobulins
The quantitative immunoglobulin blood test
measures abnormal levels of immunoglobulins,
also known as antibodies, in your blood.
Antibodies are proteins made by the immune
system. An immunoglobulin (Ig) test usually
measures 3 specific types (classes) of
immunoglobulins called IgG, IgM, and IgA.
These immunoglobulins may be abnormally
high due to your lymphoma or abnormally low
due to prior and current lymphoma treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Marginal Zone Lymphomas, 2024

SPEP
Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)
examines specific proteins in the blood called
globulins, which may be increased in certain
conditions.

15

2 Testing for MZL » Biopsy

Biopsy

A biopsy is usually done with other lab
methods to accurately diagnose the type of
MZL. Core or excisional biopsies are often
preferred for diagnosing MZL.

A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue
or fluid for testing. It is an important part of an
accurate diagnosis of lymphoma. Your sample
should be reviewed by a pathologist who is
an expert in the diagnosis of lymphoma. The
pathologist will note the overall appearance
and the size, shape, and type of your cells.
This review is often referred to as histology,
histopathology, or hematopathology review.
Tests will be done on the biopsied cells. Ask
questions about your biopsy results and what
they mean for your treatment.

These other lab methods include:





Lymph node biopsy removes tissue
from a lymph node.

Flow cytometry (FCM)
Biomarker testing to detect gene
rearrangements and karyotype or
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
for major translocations

Lymph node biopsy

Endoscopic biopsy uses a thin, tubeshaped tool guided through the mouth
to take a sample of the stomach and
intestines.

A lymph node biopsy is recommended to
diagnose MZL. Lymph nodes are usually too
small to be seen or felt. Sometimes, lymph
nodes can feel swollen, enlarged, hard to the
touch, or don’t move when pushed (fixed or
immobile). A lymph node biopsy can be done
using a needle biopsy procedure or as a small
surgery to remove (excise) a lymph node.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and
core biopsy (CB) use needles of
different sizes to remove a sample of
tissue or fluid.
Incisional biopsy removes a small
amount of tissue through a cut in the skin
or body.
Excisional biopsy removes the entire
tumor through a cut in the skin or body.

In a gene rearrangement, there is either loss or
gain of chromosomal material. A translocation
refers to the transfer of genetic material from
one chromosome to another.

A lymph node biopsy can done in the following
ways:


Immunohistochemistry (IHC)



Types of possible biopsies include the
following:

2 Testing for MZL » Biopsy

Bone marrow tests
Bone marrow tests might be done in certain
cases.
There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that
are often done at the same time:


Bone marrow aspirate



Bone marrow biopsy

Testing takes time. It might
take days or weeks for all test
results to come in.

Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding
liquid and cells. An aspirate takes some of the
liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy
takes a piece of the sponge.

through your skin and into the bone. Liquid
bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe.
For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to
remove a small piece of the bone. You may
feel bone pain at your hip for a few days. Your
skin may bruise.

For many, this is an uncomfortable procedure.
Your care team will try to make you as
comfortable as possible. The samples are
usually taken from the back of the hip bone
(pelvis). You will likely lie on your belly or side.
For an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed

2 Testing for MZL » Immunophenotyping » Biomarker and genetic tests

Immunophenotyping

cytometry is in the identification of markers on
cells, particularly in the immune system (called
immunophenotyping).

Immunophenotyping is a process that uses
antibodies to detect the presence or absence
of certain antigens. Antigens are proteins or
markers that can be found on the surface of
or inside all cells, including white blood cells.
Specific groupings of antigens are normal.
However, some specific patterns of antigens
called the immunophenotype are found
on abnormal cells including non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) and MZL.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to immune cells. The cells are
then studied using a microscope. IHC looks for
the immunophenotype of cells from a biopsy or
tissue sample.

Immunophenotyping can be done using
specialized techniques called flow cytometry
or immunohistochemistry (IHC). These
techniques are used to distinguish MZL from
other types of lymphoma. Immunophenotype
can change as cancer progresses.

Biomarker and genetic tests
Biomarker and genetic tests are used to
learn more about your type of MZL, to guide
treatment, and to determine the likely path
your cancer will take (prognosis). This genetic
testing is different from family history genetic
testing or genetic cancer risk testing. This
testing looks for changes only in the MZL
cells that have developed over time, and
not changes in the rest of your body’s cells.
Biomarker testing includes tests of genes or
their products (proteins) and identifies the
presence or absence of mutations and certain
proteins that might suggest the lymphoma
subtype. It is sometimes called molecular
testing, tumor profiling, gene expression
profiling, or genomic testing.

MZL immunophenotype is usually negative for
the proteins CD10, CD5, cyclin D1, and BCL2,
while positive for CD20. Immunophenotyping is
used to help support a diagnosis. However, an
accurate diagnosis of MZL requires a trained
pathologist to review the tissue for abnormal
cells seen under a microscope. More testing
may be needed to establish an MZL subtype.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry (FCM) is a laboratory method
used to detect, identify, and count specific
cells. Flow cytometry involves adding a
light-sensitive dye to cells. The dyed cells
are passed through a beam of light in a
machine. The machine measures the number
of cells, things like the size and shape of
the cells, and other unique features of cells.
Flow cytometry may be used on cells from
circulating (peripheral) blood, bone marrow,
or a biopsy. The most common use of flow

Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of
46 chromosomes. Each chromosome contains
thousands of genes. Genes are coded
instructions that determine what proteins
18

2 Testing for MZL » Biomarker and genetic tests

are made in your cells. A mutation is when
something goes wrong in the genetic code.
This causes a change in your DNA. Proteins
are written like this: BCL6. Genes are written
with italics like this: BCL6. When a gene or
protein is found (expressed), it is shown with a
plus sign (+) like this: CD10+. When a gene or
protein has not been found, it is written with a
negative sign (-) like this CD10-.

Mutations
MZL cells can have changes in genes
and chromosomes. Mutation testing
looks for these changes or abnormalities
that are unique to MZL cells. Examples
of such changes are called deletion,
insertion, amplification, translocation
(rearrangement), and point mutation.

MZL cells sometimes have changes in genes
and chromosomes that can be seen under a
microscope or found with other tests. These
DNA changes may affect your MZL diagnosis,
treatment options, and prognosis.

MZL mutation testing

3 Amplification – When part or whole

a chromosome or gene is increased (for
example, duplicated)

A sample of your blood or bone marrow will
be used to see if the MZL cancer cells have
any specific mutations. Some mutations can
be targeted with specific therapies. This is
separate from the genetic testing for mutations
that you may have inherited from your
biological parents.

3 Deletion – When part of a

chromosome or gene is missing

3 Insertion – When a new part of a
chromosome or gene is included

3 Inversion – Switching of parts within

Mutation testing includes tests of genes or
their products (proteins). Subtle new drugresistant mutations may occur over time.
Mutations can also happen during treatment.
Mutation testing is used to look for these new
mutations. Some mutations lead to resistance
to certain targeted therapies. There are many
possible mutations.

When described at the chromosome
level, it is called a translocation. When
described at the gene level, it is called
rearrangement.

2 Testing for MZL » Biomarker and genetic tests

Deletions

FISH can find translocations that are too small
to be seen with other methods. A translocation
occurs when parts of two chromosomes switch
with one another. However, FISH can only
be used for known changes. It cannot detect
all the possible changes found within the
chromosomes and genes.

When part of a chromosome is missing, it is
called a deletion. For example, in del(7q) the
q part of chromosome 7 is missing (deleted).
Specific chromosomal deletions can be found
in some types of marginal zone lymphomas
but can also be found in other types of blood
cancers and disorders.

Karyotype

FISH

A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes.
Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
A karyotype will show extra, missing
(deletion), rearranged, or abnormal pieces
of chromosomes. Since a karyotype requires
growing cells, a sample of bone marrow or
blood must be used.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. Since
this test doesn’t need growing cells, it can be
performed on bone marrow, lymph nodes, or a
blood sample.

Translocations

High-throughput sequencing

Translocation is a switching of parts between
two chromosomes. A translocation between
chromosomes 11 and 18 is written as t(11;18).
Specific translocations can help distinguish
between types of blood cancers and disorders.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is capable
of sequencing hundreds of millions of DNA
molecules at a time.

Gene rearrangements

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a
method used to determine a portion of a
person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene
has any mutations that might affect how the
gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more
detailed way than other methods and can find
mutations that other methods might miss.

Next-generation sequencing

In gene rearrangements, part of a gene has
broken off and attached to another gene,
creating a new gene. When one cell divides
many times, the entire group of cells is called
clonal or clonality. In clonal rearrangements,
the same gene rearrangements are found in a
group of cancer cells.

Genetic cancer risk testing

PCR

Genetic cancer risk testing is done using blood
or saliva (spitting into a cup). The goal is to
look for gene mutations inherited from your
biological parents called germline mutations.
Some mutations can put you at risk for
more than one type of cancer. You can pass
these genes on to your children. Also, family
members might carry these mutations. Tell
your care team if there is a family history of
cancer.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions
of copies of your DNA or RNA (genetic
information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find
1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000
normal cells. These copies, called PCR
product, might be used for high-throughput
sequencing (HTS) or next-generation
sequencing (NGS). This is important when
testing for treatment response or remission.

Comparative genomic hybridization
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is
a technique that compares DNA samples from
normal tissue and tumor tissue. It is used to
detect abnormal chromosomes.

2 Testing for MZL » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body to look for cancer deposits. A
radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report
to your doctor. While these reports might be
available to you through your patient portal or
patient access system, please wait to discuss
these results with your care team.

Contrast material

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that help
enhance and improve the images of several
organs and structures in the body. It is used to
make the pictures clearer. The contrast is not
permanent and will leave your body in your
urine immediately after the test. The types of
contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI.

PET scan

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans. However, not all tumors will
appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright
spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain,
heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on
PET. Inflammation or infection can also show
up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your head,
neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis may be one
of the tests to look for cancer. In most cases,
contrast will be used.

2 Testing for MZL » Heart tests

Heart tests

MUGA
A multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan is used
to evaluate the pumping function of your heart.
During the test, a small amount of radiotracer
is injected into a vein. A special camera,
called a gamma camera, will create computergenerated movie images of your beating heart.

Certain treatments can affect heart (cardiac)
function. Heart tests might be used to see
how well your heart works. These tests might
be used as a baseline and before giving
chemotherapy. You might be referred to a
heart specialist called a cardiologist.

MUGA scan might show low ejection fraction.
This is when the amount of blood pumping
from the left side of the heart is lower than
normal.

Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows
electrical changes in your heart. It reveals
information about your heart rate and rhythm.
Prolonged corrected QT interval (or QTc)
occurs when your heart muscle takes longer
than normal to recharge between beats.
Often, this electrical disturbance can be seen
on an ECG. Certain treatments for MZL can
cause prolonged QTc. If the QTc becomes
too prolonged, it can cause dangerous heart
rhythms.

Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram (or echo) uses sound
waves to make pictures. For this test, small
patches will be placed on your chest to track
your heartbeat. Next, a wand with gel on its
tip will be slid across part of your bare chest. A
picture of your beating heart will be seen on a
screen. The pictures will be recorded for future
viewing.
An echocardiogram is one way of measuring
ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood
pumped out of the left side of your heart every
time it beats. In low ejection fraction, the
amount of blood pumping from the left side of
the heart is lower than normal.

Care team

There is more than one treatment
for marginal zone lymphomas.

Those with MZL should seek treatment at
experienced cancer centers.

This chapter presents an overview
of the possible types of treatment

Treating cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.

and what to expect. Not everyone
will receive the same treatment.
Treatment options are based on
many factors. Together, you and
your care team will choose a
treatment plan that is best for you.

Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout cancer treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it. Get to know
your care team and help them get to know you.

Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is highly
treatable and may be curable in certain
circumstances. Treatment for MZL usually
consists of radiation therapy, chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, targeted therapy, antibiotic
therapy, or combinations of these treatments
(often called chemoimmunotherapy). Surgery
may be an option in very select cases of
localized marginal zone lymphoma. Localized
means confined to an area.

Depending on your diagnosis, your team might
include the following specialists:

that can affect how you think and feel.
Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,

3 Treating MZL » Treatment phases

Treatment phases

Relapse

The goal of treatment is remission. MZL might
relapse more than once. Here are some terms
you might hear used by your care team. Not all
phases are used in the treatment of MZL.

When MZL returns after a period of remission,
it is called a relapse. The goal of treatment
is to achieve remission again. A relapse can
be serious. It is important to ask about your
prognosis.

Induction

Refractory

Induction or first-line therapy is the first phase
of treatment. The goal of induction is complete
response (CR) or complete remission. After
induction, you will have tests to look for a
response (remission).

When MZL remains and does not respond to
treatment, it is called refractory or resistant
cancer. This cancer may be resistant at the
start of treatment or it may become resistant
during treatment. Refractory disease is very
serious. It is important to ask about your
prognosis.

Maintenance
Maintenance is treatment to prevent cancer
from returning. It may be given for a long
time and occur over years. Not everyone will
receive maintenance therapy. Maintenance
may be recommended depending on your type
of disease, treatments received in the past for
your lymphoma, and risk of relapse.

Surveillance and monitoring
You will be monitored throughout treatment.
Surveillance watches for any changes in your
condition after remission or a hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT). You will have tests
during surveillance to check for relapse.

Remission

Observation without treatment

There are different types of treatment
response. When there are no signs of cancer,
it is called a complete response (CR) or
complete remission. Remission can be shortterm (temporary) or long-lasting (permanent).
In partial response (PR), cancer is still present,
but it has reduced in size.

Some slow-growing (indolent) lymphomas do
not require immediate treatment, including
MZL. Observation is sometimes called
active surveillance or watch and wait. During
observation, your care team will monitor for
symptoms to appear. Once specific signs or
symptoms appear, you will start treatment.
Ask your care team what specific signs or
symptoms they will be looking for.
A sign can be seen by someone else like your
doctor or nurse. A symptom is something only
you can feel.

3 Treating MZL » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

The choice of therapy takes into consideration
many factors, including age, other serious
health issues, and future treatment possibilities
like a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Your
preferences about treatment are important.
If you have any religious or personal beliefs
about certain kinds of treatment, now would be
the time to share them with your care team.

Systemic therapy works throughout
the body. Types include chemotherapy,
chemoimmunotherapy, immunotherapy, and
targeted therapy. Systemic therapy might be
used alone or with other therapies. Goals of
systemic therapy may be curative or palliative
and should be discussed before starting
treatment.

3 Treating MZL » Chemotherapy » Immunotherapy

Chemotherapy

Immunotherapy

Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. More than one
chemotherapy may be used to treat MZL.
When only one drug is used, it’s called a single
agent. A combination or multi-agent regimen
is the use of two or more chemotherapy
drugs. An example of a chemotherapy drug
combination (regimen) is cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, and prednisone (CVP).

Immunotherapy is drug therapy that increases
the activity of your immune system. By doing
so, it improves your body’s ability to find and
destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy can be
given alone or with other types of treatment.
Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is an example of an
immune modulator.

Monoclonal antibody therapy
Antibody therapy uses special proteins
normally produced by white blood cells
and infection-fighting cells to help the body
fight cancer, infection, or other diseases.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in cancer
treatment may kill cancer cells directly or help
the immune system recognize and then kill the
cancer cells. As with other treatments, there is
the potential for complications.

Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that
are infused into a vein or injected under the
skin with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs
may be given as a pill that is swallowed. The
final dose differs between people because it is
based on body weight and height. Intrathecal
chemotherapy is injected into spinal or brain
fluid.

CD20-targeting monoclonal antibody
therapy
CD20-targeting mAbs (also called anti-CD20
mAbs) such as rituximab (Rituxan) and
obinutuzumab (Gazyva) work against the
protein CD20 found on the surface of B cells
and MZL. The drug attaches to the CD20
protein causing direct cell death. It also alerts
the immune system to the cancer. This triggers
normal immune cells to kill the cancer cells.

In most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles
of treatment days followed by days of rest.
This allows the body to recover before the
next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending
on which chemotherapy is used. You will have
tests to see how the cancer is responding to
treatment. You might spend time in the hospital
during treatment.

Chemoimmunotherapy

Bispecific monoclonal antibody therapy
Bispecific antibodies (BsABs) bind to 2
different proteins (CD20 and CD3 antigen) at
the same time. It treats cancer by engaging T
cells. Bispecifics such as epcoritamab-bysp
(Epkinly) and glofitamab-gxbm (Columvi)
might be an option after an HCT or CAR
T-cell therapy for those with MZL that has
transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

Chemoimmunotherapy, also called
immunochemotherapy, includes chemotherapy
and immunotherapy drugs (agents) to
treat cancer. One example is rituximab,
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
and prednisone (RCHOP).

3 Treating MZL » Immunotherapy

(DLBCL). Bispecifics can cause a side effect
called cytokine release syndrome.

CD19-targeting CAR T-cell therapy
CAR T-cell therapy is made by removing T
cells from your body and then training your
own immune cells to fight the lymphoma
for you by adding a CAR (chimeric antigen
receptor) to the T cells. This programs the T
cells to find cancer cells. The programmed
T cells will be infused back into your body to
find and kill cancer cells. This treatment is
not for everyone. There can be severe and
sometimes life-threatening reactions to this
treatment.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.
It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

CAR T-cell therapy is one way to target the
CD19 protein found on almost all B-cell
lymphomas, including MZL. There are
currently 4 kinds of CD19-directed CAR T-cell
therapies FDA-approved in different subtypes
of lymphoma. While none is specifically FDAapproved for marginal zone lymphomas,
axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta),
tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah), and lisocabtagene
maraleucel (Breyanzi) have been studied in
this disease and may be an option in third-line
or later treatment.

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care
medicines given during systemic therapy.
Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.

3 Treating MZL » Targeted therapy » Immune modulator

Targeted therapy

A biosimilar or substitute might
be used in place of rituximab. A
biosimilar is an almost identical
version of a drug made by another
company. It is used in the exact
same way and at the same dose as
rituximab. Biosimilars for rituximab
include: Riabni, Hycela, Ruxience,
and Truxima.

Targeted therapy is drug therapy that focuses
on specific or unique features of cancer cells.
Targeted therapies seek out how cancer cells
grow, divide, and move in the body. These
drugs stop or inhibit the action of proteins
within the cancer cells that help cancer cells
grow and/or survive.


Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(BTKi) such as acalabrutinib
(Calquence), ibrutinib (Imbruvica), and
zanubrutinib (Brukinsa) block the BTK
protein, which the lymphoma cancer relies
on for survival. Since the main signal for
MZL growth is blocked, the lymphoma
cells eventually die off.

Immune modulator
An immunomodulator changes your immune
system so it can work more effectively.
Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is an example of an
immune modulator.

Your preferences about
treatment are always important.
If you have any religious or
personal beliefs about certain
kinds of treatment, share
them with your care team and
make your wishes known. A

3 Treating MZL » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

External beam radiation
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s) or areas of the body.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from photons, electrons, or protons,
and other sources to kill cancer cells and
shrink tumors. RT may be used as the main
treatment to cure cancer (curative treatment),
or as supportive care or palliative care to help
ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer.

Common types of EBRT that may be used to
treat your cancer include the following:


Radiation is typically delivered from outside
the body by a computerized device, which
can shape the treatment to closely fit the
location and size of the tumor. Treatment is
given in small daily doses, on workdays, with
weekends off. RT treatments for those with
MZL can be as short as 2 days (otherwise
known as 4 Grays), or as much as 15-20 days
(or 30-40 Grays).





You will see your radiation oncologist at least
weekly to review your progress and to help
with side effects, such as sunburn-like rash.
Ask your care team which radiation option(s)
are best for your situation, if RT will be
combined with chemotherapy, and what side
effects to expect. RT puts you at a small risk of
developing another cancer in the future.

Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape of
the tumor.
Involved-site radiation therapy
(ISRT) treats the cancer site or cancer
found in or near lymph nodes (nodal
disease).

Total body irradiation
Total body irradiation (TBI) is radiation of
the whole body given before bone marrow
transplant.

A four-dimensional (4D) CT scan might be
used to plan RT. A 4D-CT records multiple
images over time. It allows playback of the
scan as a video, so that internal movement
can be tracked and observed.

Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses
computer software and CT images to aim
beams that match the shape of the tumor.

can take several hours. The transplanted
stem cells will travel to your bone marrow
and grow. New, healthy blood cells will form.
This is called engraftment. It usually takes
about 2 to 4 weeks. Until then, you will have
little or no immune defense. You may need to
stay in a very clean room at the hospital or be
given antibiotics to prevent or treat infection.
Transfusions are also possible. A red blood cell
transfusion is used to prevent bleeding and
to treat anemia (below normal red blood cell
count). A platelet transfusion is used to treat
a low platelet count or bleeding. While waiting
for the cells to engraft, you will likely feel tired
and weak.

A hematopoietic stem cell is an immature cell
that can develop into any type of blood cell. A
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) replaces
hematopoietic stem cells that have been
destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/
or radiation therapy as part of the transplant
process. You might hear it called a stem cell
transplant (SCT) or a bone marrow transplant
(BMT). This book will refer to it as HCT. HCTs
are performed in specialized centers.
There are 2 types of HCTs:




The goal of the transplant is for the new
immune system to recognize the lymphoma as
foreign and destroy it.

Autologous – stem cells come from you.
An autologous HCT (autotransplant) is
generally not used as a treatment in MZL.
Allogeneic – stem cells come from a
donor who may or may not be related to
you.

Possible side effects
Every treatment has side effects. You will be
monitored for infections, decreases in your
blood counts that require blood transfusions,
disease relapse, and graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD). In GVHD, the donor cells attack your
normal, healthy tissue. There are treatments
for GVHD. Ask your care team about the
possible side effects or complications of HCT
and how this might affect your quality of life.

Allogeneic transplant
An allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(allogeneic HCT) uses healthy stem cells
from a donor. The donor may or may not be
related to you. Before an HCT, treatment is
needed to destroy bone marrow cells. This
is called conditioning, and it creates room for
the healthy donor stem cells. It also weakens
the immune system so your body won’t kill the
transplanted cells. Chemotherapy is used for
conditioning. Radiation therapy may also be
given as part of conditioning treatment.

More information on GVHD can be found
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

After conditioning, you will receive a
transfusion of the healthy stem cells from a
donor matched to you. A transfusion is a slow
injection of blood products into a vein. This

Surgery

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

Typically, surgery is not used to treat MZL.
Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. Surgery might
include the removal of the spleen called a
splenectomy. If surgery is needed, seek the
opinion of an experienced surgeon. The
surgeon should be an expert in performing
your type of surgery in those with MZL.
Hospitals that perform many surgeries
often have better results. You can ask for a
referral to a hospital or cancer center that has
experience in treating your type of cancer.







Clinical trials


A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Phase I trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase II trials study how well the drug
or approach works against a specific type
of cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or
approach against a standard treatment. If
the results are good, it may be approved
by the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, lab
tests, or general health. These requirements
ensure that participants are alike in specific
ways and that the trial is as safe as possible
for the participants.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,

friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Start the conversation

Finding a clinical trial

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
It depends on the study, your health insurance,
and the state in which you live. In general,
procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered
standard of care will be billed to you or
your insurance, whereas those considered
research are covered by the trial sponsor. Your
treatment team and the research team can
help determine if you are responsible for any
costs.

3 Treating MZL » Supportive care

Supportive care

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Supportive care might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you are
feeling and about any side effects so they can
be managed. Supportive care, best supportive
care, and palliative care often mean the same
thing.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.
Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

A personalized survivorship care plan will
contain a summary of possible long-term
effects of treatment called late effects and list
follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care
provider will coordinate with specialists for your
follow-up care.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Side effects

Fatigue
Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may be
caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of
treatment. Let your care team know how you
are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of
doing the things you enjoy. Eating a balanced
diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage
therapy can help. You might be referred to a
nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue.

Some potential side effects are described next.
They are not listed in order of importance.
Some side effects are very rare.

Blood clots
Cancer can cause blood clots to form. This can
block blood flow and oxygen in the body. Blood
clots can break loose and travel to other parts
of the body causing stroke or other problems.

Hair loss

Cytokine release syndrome

Chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia)
all over your body—not just on your scalp.
Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely
than others to cause hair loss. Dosage might
also affect the amount of hair loss. Most of
the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is
temporary. Hair often regrows 3 to 6 months
after treatment ends. Your hair may be a
different shade or texture.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a
condition that may occur after treatment
with some types of immunotherapy, such
as monoclonal antibodies and CAR T cells.
It is caused by a large, rapid release of
cytokines from immune cells affected by the
immunotherapy. Signs and symptoms of
CRS include fever, muscle aches, nausea,
headache, rash, fast heartbeat, low blood
pressure, and trouble breathing.

Hand-foot syndrome
Hand-foot syndrome is a common side
effect of chemotherapy. Small amounts of
chemotherapy leak out of very small blood
vessels called capillaries in the palms of the
hands and soles of the feet. It causes redness,
swelling, and pain. Sometimes blisters appear.
You will want to protect your hands and feet by
applying moisturizer or lotion.

Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how to
manage diarrhea. It is important to drink lots of
fluids.

Distress

Hypersensitivity, allergy, and
anaphylaxis

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicines that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Marginal Zone Lymphomas, 2024

Certain treatments can cause an unwanted
reaction. Hypersensitivity is an exaggerated
response by the immune system to a drug or
other substance. This can include hives, skin
welts, and trouble breathing. An allergy is an
38

3 Treating MZL » Side effects

Loss of appetite

immune reaction to a substance that normally
is harmless or would not cause an immune
response in most people. An allergic response
may cause harmful symptoms such as itching
or inflammation (swelling). Anaphylaxis or
anaphylactic shock is a severe and possible
life-threatening allergic reaction.

Sometimes side effects from cancer or its
treatment, and the stress of having cancer
might cause you to feel not hungry or sick to
your stomach (nauseated). You might have a
sore mouth or difficulty swallowing. Healthy
eating is important during treatment. It includes
eating a balanced diet, eating the right
amount of food, and drinking enough fluids. A
registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition
and food can help. Speak to your care team if
you have trouble eating or maintaining weight.

Infections
Infections occur more frequently and are more
severe in those with a weakened immune
system. Drug treatment for MZL can weaken
the body’s natural defense against infections. If
not treated early, infections can be fatal.
Neutropenia, a low number of white blood
cells, can lead to frequent or severe
infections. When someone with neutropenia
also develops a fever, it is called febrile
neutropenia (FN). With FN, your risk of
infection may be higher than normal. This
is because a low number of white blood
cells leads to a reduced ability to fight
infections. FN is a side effect of some types
of systemic therapy.

Low blood cell counts

Lymphedema

Some cancer treatments can cause low blood
cell counts.

Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph
fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.
It may be caused when part of the lymph
system is damaged or blocked, such as
during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment, or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression devices, and
other means.

Anemia is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to
your cells. You might tire easily if you are
anemic.
Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infection.
Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

Seek out support groups
at your local hospital,
through social media,

Neurocognitive or
neuropsychological effects

Keep a pain diary

Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems
with concentration and memory. Survivors
are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be
recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of
your brain affects your thinking and behavior.
Neuropsychological testing can identify your
limits and doctors can create a plan to help
with these limits.

A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.
Include in your pain diary:

Pain

All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important to tell your
care team about all of your side
effects so they can be managed.

Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain.

Quality of life
Cancer and its treatment can affect your
overall well-being or quality of life (QOL). For
more information on quality of life, see NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Palliative Care at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Tumor lysis syndrome
Cancer treatment causes cell death. In tumor
lysis syndrome (TLS), waste released by
dead cells builds up in the body causing
kidney damage and severe blood electrolyte
disturbances. Changes in creatinine, lactic
acid, uric acid, phosphorus (Phos), potassium
(K), and calcium (Ca) levels can be a sign of
TLS. TLS is rare.

Weight gain

Therapy-related toxicity

Weight gain is one side effect of high-dose
steroids. This can be uncomfortable and cause
distress. It is important to maintain muscle
mass. Find a physical activity you enjoy. Ask
your care team what can be done to help
manage weight gain.

Many of the drug therapies used to treat
marginal zone lymphomas can be harmful
to the body. You will be closely monitored for
therapy-related toxicity.

best for you.

Overview



The stomach is part of the digestive or
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract also
includes the esophagus, small intestine,
colon, and rectum. The innermost layer of
the GI tract is called the mucosa. Extranodal
marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL) of the
stomach forms in cells in the mucosa that help
make antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that
protect you when an unwanted substance or
infection enters your body. Those with EMZL
of the stomach may also have infection in the
stomach caused by Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) or an autoimmune disease, such as
Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sjögren syndrome.
EMZL of the stomach is also called gastric
EMZL. Most EMZLs grow slowly and tend not
to spread to other places in the body.







Stage 2 disease – Cancer is also found
in the lymph nodes near the stomach.
Stage 2E disease – Cancer has grown
though the layers of the stomach wall
(serosa) and into nearby organs and
tissues.
Stage 4 disease – Cancer has spread
from the stomach and is found on both
sides of the diaphragm or in distant sites
such as bone marrow or distant lymph
nodes.

In EMZL of the stomach, staging is based
on a biopsy taken during an endoscopy and
testing for H. pylori. In an endoscopy, a device
is guided down the throat into the stomach.
You will likely have more than one endoscopy
and biopsy through the course of diagnosis,
treatment, and follow-up for your EMZL.

EMZL cancer stages
Cancer staging is used to reflect prognosis and
help guide treatment decisions. The American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) created

Marginal Zone Lymphomas, 2024

Early-stage or stage 1 disease –
Cancer is found only in the stomach.

45

4 Extranodal MZL (stomach only) » Overview

H. pylori

Lymph drains from the stomach wall into
lymphatic vessels in the mucosa and
submucosa. From here it drains into lymph
nodes outside the stomach. There are
several groups of regional lymph nodes that
drain the wall of the stomach. They include
pyloric (pylorus area of stomach), perigastric,
pericardiac at the esophagogastric junction,
and lymph nodes near organs and arteries
such as the pancreas, spleen (splenic), and
liver (hepatic).

Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori is a type of
bacterium that causes inflammation and ulcers
in the stomach or small intestine. People
with H. pylori infections may be more likely
to develop cancer in the stomach, including
EMZL of the stomach. You will be tested for H.
pylori before starting treatment.

Lymph nodes
EMZL of the stomach can sometimes spread
to nearby lymph nodes. There are hundreds of
lymph nodes throughout your body. They work
as filters to help fight infection and remove
harmful things from your body. Regional lymph
nodes are found near the stomach.

The largest group of stomach lymph nodes are
the perigastric lymph nodes found along the
lesser and greater curves of the stomach and
in the omenta. The omentum is a fold of the
thin tissue that lines the abdomen (peritoneum)

Layers of the stomach wall
The wall of the stomach is made up of
5 layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscle
layer, subserosa, and serosa.

that surrounds the stomach and other organs
in the abdomen.

A translocation is a switching of parts between
two chromosomes. A translocation between
chromosome 11 and 18 is written as t(11;18).
t(11;18) occurs specifically in some cases of
EMZL of the stomach and is the most frequent
genetic abnormality found in this tumor. If this
translocation is found, the tumor tends not
to respond to antibiotic treatment in gastric
EMZL cancers caused by H. pylori infection.
Therefore, radiation therapy and/or rituximab
will usually be given with antibiotics.

Testing
To diagnose extranodal MZL of the stomach,
a biopsy sample will be taken during an
endoscopy. In an endoscopy, a device is
guided down the throat into the stomach. The
sample will be tested to confirm you have
EMZL of the stomach, to learn more about
the cancer, and to plan treatment. EMZL of
the stomach immunophenotype is usually
CD10-, CD5-, CD20+, cyclin D1-, and BCL2-.
This means that the abnormal B cells express
CD20, but not CD10, CD5, cyclin D1, or BCL2.

Tests used to diagnose EMZL of the stomach
are found in Guide 2.

Guide 2
Tests to diagnose EMZL of the stomach

Needed

4 Extranodal MZL (stomach only) » Stage 1

Stage 1

After treatment with ISRT or
rituximab

Stage 1 cancer is confined to the stomach.
Since EMZL of the stomach is often the
result of an infection with H. pylori, the
initial treatment is antibiotic therapy, usually
combined with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
PPIs reduce the production of stomach acid
to help prevent or heal ulcers. Many of these
lymphomas go away following antibiotic and
PPI treatment, although this may take several
months. Additional treatment might include
radiation therapy or rituximab. Involved-site
radiation therapy (ISRT) treats the cancer site
or cancer found in or near lymph nodes (nodal
disease).

After about 6 months of completing treatment,
the lymphoma will be restaged with an
endoscopic biopsy to see if H. pylori or
lymphoma remain and to rule out diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Stage 2 disease is found in lymph nodes near
the stomach. Stage 2E disease has extended
outside the stomach into the surrounding
organs or tissues. Disease that has grown
outside the stomach, has spread to distant
areas of the body (stage 4), or is causing
symptoms might be referred to as distant nodal
or advanced stage.

Treatment includes first-line systemic therapy
or ISRT. A clinical trial is always an option even
in those without signs or symptoms.

The stomach is the most common site
for extranodal marginal zone lymphoma
(EMZL).



EMZL of the stomach forms in cells in
the innermost layer of the digestive tract
called the mucosa.

If EMZL of the stomach tests negative
for H. pylori, the preferred treatment is
involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT).
For disease that has grown outside the
stomach, has spread to distant areas
of the body, or is causing symptoms,
treatment might include systemic therapy.

EMZL of the stomach can be the result of
an infection with H. pylori.
If EMZL of the stomach tests positive
for H. pylori, then the initial treatment is
antibiotic therapy.

EMZL of the stomach can sometimes spread to nearby lymph nodes
and other tissues and organs outside of the stomach.

Testing

What’s the difference between a
sign and symptom?

To diagnose EMZL, a biopsy sample will be
taken and tested. EMZL immunophenotype
is usually CD10-, CD5-, CD20+, CD23-/+,
CD43-/+, cyclin D1-, and BCL2-. This means
that the abnormal B cells express CD20, but
not CD10, CD5, cyclin D1, or BCL2. CD23 or
CD43 may be present.

A sign can be seen by someone
else like a doctor or nurse. A
symptom is something only you
can feel.

Translocation is a switching of parts between
two chromosomes. A translocation between
chromosome 11 and 18 is written as t(11;18).
t(11;18) occurs specifically in EMZL and is the
most frequent genetic abnormality found in this
tumor.
Tests used to diagnose EMZL of non-stomach
sites can be found in Guide 6.

Guide 6
Tests to diagnose EMZL not found in the stomach

Needed

• Biopsy and hematopathology review
• IHC panel: CD20, CD3, CD5, CD10, BCL2, kappa/ lambda, CD21 or
CD23, and cyclin D1 with or without cell surface marker analysis by

In some cases

• Biomarker testing to detect: immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements
and MYD88 mutation status to differentiate between Waldenström
macroglobulinemia (WM) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), PCR for
t(11;18)
• Karyotype or FISH: t(11;18); t(1;14); t(3;14)

is used to inspect the lining of these organs
and to look for any signs of cancer or other
abnormalities such as enlarged blood vessels
or ulcers. An EGD can also be referred to as a
duodenoscopy.

EMZL can appear in a variety of areas
throughout the body. Therefore, treatment
is based on the exact location and extent
of spread. In cases where primary site is
thought to be in the head, neck, or lungs, an
upper GI endoscopy should be considered.

Stage 1 and 2 (limited)
The preferred treatment for disease that is
limited to the organ is involved-site radiation
therapy (ISRT). In some cases, surgery might
be an option for sites such as the skin, lung,
breast (lumpectomy), thyroid, colon, and small
bowel. ISRT might follow surgery. In some
cases, rituximab or observation may also be
options.

Local
A local recurrence is the return of cancer near
the same place as before. You might receive

Follow-up care
After treatment, you will be monitored for signs
or symptoms that cancer has returned. During
this time, you will have a physical exam with

Since nodal MZL is most often a slow-growing
(indolent) disease, your care team might
wait until symptoms appear before starting
treatment. This is called active surveillance,
observation, or watch and wait. During active
surveillance, your care team will monitor for
symptoms to appear. Once specific signs or
symptoms appear, you will start treatment.
Treatment options include radiation therapy,
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a clinical
trial. Involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT)
treats cancer located in a small region or one
area of your body.

The spleen

The spleen makes immune cells,
filters the blood, stores blood

The spleen is a fist-sized organ located on
the left side of the body near the stomach,
pancreas, and just under the diaphragm. The
spleen filters your blood of antigens (proteins)
and microorganisms, and removes any old,
damaged, or worn-out red blood cells. The
spleen also contains infection-fighting white
blood cells and controls the level of blood
cells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and
platelets) in the body.

The spleen
The spleen is made up of
red and white pulp. Red pulp
is a loose spongy tissue
that contains lymphocytes,
macrophages, granulocytes,
and plasma cells. White pulp
is all lymphatic (lymphoid)
tissue. It contains white blood
cells.

Red pulp

Marginal zone

Red pulp gives the spleen its red color. It is a
loose spongy tissue that contains white blood
cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages,
granulocytes, and plasma cells. The red
pulp removes red blood cells—which carry
oxygen—when they are old, damaged, or
infected. It harvests the iron from the old red
blood cells for recycling into new blood cells.

The marginal zone is the region at the
intersection of the red pulp and white pulp of the
spleen. Cancer of the B cells in this zone affects
the movement of blood through the spleen.

Testing
Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is
the rarest type of marginal zone lymphoma.
SMZL may be diagnosed by removal of the
spleen (splenectomy), or by biopsy of the
bone marrow and blood testing with imaging
and other findings. SMZL immunophenotype
is usually CD10-, CD5-, CD20+, CD23-/+,
CD43-/+, and cyclin D1-, BCL2-, annexin
A1, and CD103- (distinction from hairy cell
leukemia) with expression of both IgM and IgD.
NOTCH2 and KLF2 mutation status may be
helpful to differentiate SMZL from other B-cell
lymphoma subtypes.

White pulp
White pulp is all lymphatic (lymphoid) tissue.
It is called white because it looks whiter
than the surrounding red pulp. White pulp of
the spleen has 3 sections: the periarteriolar
lymphatic sheath (PALS), the follicles, and the
marginal zone. The marginal zone is where
the distribution of blood flow between slow and
fast transit pathways is controlled.

Enlarged spleen

Treatment

If you have an enlarged spleen
(splenomegaly), your blood will be tested for
hepatitis C (HCV). If you test positive for HCV,
HCV infection may be causing the SMZL.
Anti-viral medicines used to treat HCV can
also treat the SMZL. If you continue to have
symptoms and low blood cell counts, then
treatment with rituximab is preferred. Surgery
to remove the spleen (splenectomy) is an
option, but is rarely used. Pneumococcal,
meningococcal, haemophilus influenza, and
hepatitis B vaccinations should be given at
least 2 weeks before a splenectomy.

Tests used to plan treatment are found in

Guide 13.

Observation
Treatment can sometimes wait if:

Recurrence

You can live a normal, healthy life without a
spleen. However, your care team will try other
treatments before removing your spleen. If
your spleen is removed, other organs, such as
the liver, can take over many of the spleen’s
functions.

Recurrence is the return of cancer.
Treatment will likely start when you have any
of the following:


Follow-up care
After treatment, you will be monitored for the
return of cancer. During this time, you will have
a physical exam with lab and imaging tests
every 3 to 6 months for 5 years and then every
year afterward or as needed.

The spleen is the largest lymphatic organ.
It makes immune cells, filters the blood,
stores blood cells, and removes old blood
cells.

We want your
feedback!

Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL)
is found in the blood, bone marrow, and
marginal zone of the spleen.

Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.

Treatment can sometimes wait until you
have symptoms, an enlarged spleen,
and a worsening low red blood cell, white
blood cell, or platelet count.

Take our survey to let us know
what we got right and what we
could do better.

If you test positive for hepatitis C, then it
will be treated.
After treatment, you will be monitored
for recurrence, the return of cancer.
Recurrence is treated with systemic
therapy, surgery to remove the spleen
(splenectomy), or involved-site radiation
therapy (ISRT).



Overview
Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) can transform
into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
This can occur before, during, or after
treatment. In DLBCL, fast-dividing cells are
commonly found in lymph nodes, spleen, liver,
bone marrow, or other tissues and organs.







MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 gene
rearrangements are commonly found in
DLBCL.





Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) will be done to look for gene
rearrangements.

Pola-R-CHP consists of
polatuzumab vedotin-piiq, rituximab,
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and
prednisone.

Other possible chemoimmunotherapy options
include:

Certain gene rearrangements can be found
in DLBCL. In gene rearrangements, part of a
gene has broken off and attached to another
gene.

8 Transformed MZL » After multiple lines of therapy

The goal of treatment is remission. If an HCT
is being considered, it is usually decided
early in treatment planning because having
an HCT will affect future treatment options.
Certain treatments are not recommended
before or after an HCT. For example, HCT is
not recommended after CAR T-cell therapy.
However, bispecific monoclonal antibody
therapy can be given after HCT or CAR T-cell
therapy.

If cancer returns or does not respond to
treatment, another systemic therapy will be
given. After multiple lines of systemic therapy,
CAR T-cell therapy or bispecific monoclonal
antibody therapy might be given.
CAR T-cell therapy options include the
following:

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There

records sent to the doctor you will see for
