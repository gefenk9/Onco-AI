About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Version 1.2025 –
August 8, 2024.

What is CML?
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of
blood cancer. Blood is a tissue. A tissue is a
group of cells that work together to perform a
function. Blood’s function is to move oxygen
and nutrients throughout your body and carry
away waste. Blood also plays an important
role for the immune system and in preventing
bleeding. There are 4 main components of
blood—plasma, red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets.

There are 3 types of blood cells:




Types of blood cells
Your blood contains different types of cells that
float in plasma. Plasma is a clear, yellowish
fluid made up of mostly water.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes)
carry oxygen throughout the body.
White blood cells (WBCs or leukocytes),
which include granulocytes, monocytes,
and lymphocytes, fight infections.
Platelets (PLTs or thrombocytes) help
control bleeding.

1 About CML » What is CML?

In CML, there are usually too many white
blood cells (granulocytes). Sometimes, there
are too few or too many platelets, as well.
Chronic means this cancer worsens slowly.

cells in various stages of development, from
very young (immature) to almost fully mature.
This process is called differentiation. Blood
stem cells give rise to red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs),
which are then released into your bloodstream
as needed.

Granulocytes include:


Neutrophils



Eosinophils



Basophils

The role of blood stem cells is to make cells
called intermediaries that will become red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
These intermediaries are called progenitor
cells or precursor cells.

How are blood cells formed?
Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue in
the center of most bones. Inside your bone
marrow are early blood-forming cells called
blood (hematopoietic) stem cells. All types of
blood cells are created from blood stem cells.
At any given time, the bone marrow will have

lymphocytes.

Philadelphia chromosome
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by a single, specific abnormal gene that is
created when a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 break off and trade
places. The result is a fused gene called BCR::ABL1 and a shortened chromosome 22 called
the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome.



Myeloid progenitor cells form into
myeloblasts and other non-lymphoid
blood cells.

Those with CML should be
treated at centers experienced
in this type of cancer.

Often, in CML the very immature or most
immature cells (myeloblasts or lymphoblasts)
are referred to simply as blasts.

What can you do to get the
best care?

CML is thought to arise from blood stem cells
that make an increased amount of myeloid
progenitor cells. However, an advanced form
of CML, called blast phase CML (BP-CML),
can cause an increased amount of lymphoid
or myeloid progenitor cells. The type of blast
phase cell will affect treatment in BP-CML.

Advocate for yourself. You have an important
role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more
likely to get the care you want by asking
questions and making shared decisions with
your care team. Consider seeking the opinion
of a CML specialist.

What causes CML?

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help
you understand cancer care. With better
understanding, you’ll be more prepared to
discuss your care with your team and share
your concerns. Many people feel more
satisfied when they play an active role in their
care.

The cause of CML can be traced to a single,
specific abnormal gene called BCR::ABL1.
This fused gene occurs when a piece of
chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome
22 break off and switch places. This creates a
new, abnormal chromosome 22 that contains
a small part of chromosome 9. This new
chromosome is referred to as the Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph) and is the hallmark of CML.
If you do not have the Ph chromosome or
the BCR::ABL1 gene, you do not have CML.
BCR::ABL1 is not found in normal blood cells.
It is not passed down from birth parents to
children. The BCR::ABL1 gene makes a new
protein that leads to uncontrolled blood cell
growth. This growth ultimately leads to CML.
Treatment for CML aims to stop the activity of
the BCR::ABL1 protein.

During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:

Medical history



A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat





To date, there is no compelling evidence that
having a family history of CML increases the
chances of developing CML. However, other
cancers and diseases can run in families. Your
care team will ask about the health history of
family members who are blood relatives. This
information is called a family history. Ask family
members on both sides of your family about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific
type of cancer or where the cancer started, if it
is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic
testing.

Family history

Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate

Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched
Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin
Feel your abdomen and below your left
ribcage to see if your spleen is enlarged.
An enlarged spleen is one sign of CML.

Blood tests
Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into a vein in your
arm. Some blood tests are described next.

Blood clotting tests
Your body stops bleeding by turning blood into
a gel-like form. The gel-like blood forms into
a solid mass called a blood clot. Clotting is a
process or series of events. Proteins, called
coagulation factors, are needed for clotting.
They are made by the liver. These tests are
known together as a coagulation panel or
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
panel.
10

2 Tests » Blood tests

An impaired clotting process is common in
leukemia. This is called coagulopathy. You
may have bleeding and bruises or blood clots.

Be prepared to have many
blood tests.

Complete blood count and
differential
Hepatitis B panel

A complete blood count (CBC) measures
the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in
your blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a
picture of your overall bone marrow health. A
differential counts the number of each type of
WBC (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,
eosinophils, and basophils). It also checks if
the counts are in balance with each other. CML
often causes a high WBC count and/or high
PLT count but can sometimes cause low RBC
counts.

Hepatitis is a virus that causes inflammation
of the liver. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is spread
by contact with blood and other bodily fluids. A
blood test will show if you had hepatitis in the
past or if you have it today. Some treatments
might cause HBV to reactivate, which can
cause liver damage. There are ways to prevent
or treat reactivation.

HLA typing
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a protein
found on the surface of most cells. It plays
an important role in your body’s immune
response. HLAs are unique to each person.
They mark your body’s cells. Your body
detects these markers to tell which cells are
yours. In other words, all your cells have the
same set of HLAs. Each person’s set of HLAs
is called the HLA type or tissue type.

Chemistry profile
A chemistry profile or panel measures the
levels of different substances released into
your blood by the liver, bone, and other organs.

Creatinine
Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles.
Every person generates a fixed amount of
creatinine every day based on how much
muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the
blood tells how well the kidneys are working.
Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys
aren’t working as well as when someone had
lower levels of creatinine.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 2025

HLA typing is a blood test that detects a
person’s HLA type. This test is done before
a donor (allogeneic) hematopoietic cell
transplant. To find a donor match, your
proteins will be compared to the donor’s white
blood cells to see how many proteins are the
same. A very good match is needed for a
transplant to be a treatment option. Otherwise,
your body will reject the donor cells or the
donor cells will react against your body. Blood
samples from you and your blood relatives will
be tested first.

Fertility (all genders)

Liver function tests
Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that are
made or processed by the liver. Levels that
are too high or low signal that the liver is not
working well.

Treatment with targeted therapy and other
forms of systemic therapy can affect your
fertility, or the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might affect your fertility.

Pregnancy test

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t sure at the
moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists
can help you sort through what may be best for
your situation.

Those who can become pregnant will be given
a pregnancy test before treatment begins.

Uric acid
Uric acid is released by cells when DNA
breaks down. It is a normal waste product
that dissolves in the blood and is filtered by
the kidneys where it leaves the body in the
urine. Too much uric acid in the body is called
hyperuricemia. With CML, it can be caused
by fast turnover (cell death) of white blood
cells (WBCs). High uric acid might be a side
effect of treatment. Very high levels of uric acid
in the blood can cause kidney stones, kidney
damage, and gout (inflammation of joints). You
may be prescribed allopurinol for a brief period
of time after starting primary treatment.

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 2025

More information on fertility preservation can
be found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

2 Tests » Performance status » Bone marrow tests

Performance status

Bone marrow tests

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be
rated using a PS scale called the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score
or the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS).
PS is one factor taken into consideration when
choosing a treatment plan. Your preferences
about treatment are always important.

Leukemia starts in the bone marrow. To
diagnose CML and determine the CML phase,
samples of bone marrow are collected and
tested before starting any treatment. Although
this can sometimes be a painful procedure,
your care team will try to make you as
comfortable as possible. Usually, you will only
have this test once at diagnosis. However, you
might have it again during or after treatment, if
needed.
There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that
are often done at the same time:

Samples of bone and
marrow are removed
in a bone marrow
biopsy. A bone marrow
aspirate and biopsy
is needed to diagnose
CML.

Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding

liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy
takes a piece of the sponge.

but it cannot detect the subtle differences
between different types of blood cancers.
Flow cytometry can help detect these subtle
differences.

The samples are usually taken from the back
of the hip bone (pelvis). You will likely lie on
your belly or side. Your doctors will first clean
your skin, then give sedation and/or numb
your skin and outer surface of your bone. For
an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed
through your skin and into the bone. Liquid
bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe.
For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used
to remove a core sample. You may feel bone
pain at your hip for a few days. Your skin may
bruise.

Testing for CML biomarker
and genetic changes
Biomarker and genetic tests are used to
learn more about your type of CML, to target
treatment, and to determine the likely path
your cancer will take (prognosis). This genetic
testing is different from family history genetic
testing or genetic cancer risk testing. This
testing looks for changes only in the CML
cells that have developed over time, and
not changes in the rest of your body’s cells.
Testing will look for the Philadelphia (Ph)
chromosome, which is used to diagnose and
to help determine the CML phase. You may be
placed into a risk group based on the types of
genetic abnormalities found.

Your bone marrow sample should be
reviewed by a pathologist who is an expert
in the diagnosis of CML. This review is often
referred to as histology, histopathology, or
hematopathology review. The pathologist will
note the overall appearance and the size,
shape, and type of your cells. Tests will be
done on the biopsied cells. Ask questions
about your biopsy results and what it means
for your treatment.

Inside our cells are DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of
46 chromosomes. Each chromosome contains
thousands of genes. Genes are coded
instructions for the proteins your cells make.
A mutation is when something goes wrong in
the genetic code. Proteins are written like this:
BCR::ABL1. Genes are written in italics like
this: BCR::ABL1.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry is a laboratory method used to
detect, identify, and count specific cells. Flow
cytometry involves adding a light-sensitive dye
to cells. The dyed cells are passed through
a beam of light in a machine. The machine
measures the number of cells.
Flow cytometry may be used on cells from
circulating (peripheral) blood or from a bone
marrow aspirate. A blood test can count
the number of white blood cells (WBCs),

Mutation testing

FISH

Mutation testing uses methods such as
karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and
next-generation sequencing (NGS) to look for
changes or abnormalities that are unique to
CML cells (genes and chromosomes). Some
mutations may determine the type of treatment
given. Subtle new drug-resistant mutations
in the BCR::ABL1 gene may emerge over
time. They can happen as CML progresses to
advanced phases such as accelerated or blast
phase. Some mutations lead to resistance to
certain targeted therapies. There are many
possible mutations.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. For
example, the probes attach to the BCR gene
and the ABL1 gene. The BCR::ABL1 gene
is detected when the colors of the probes
overlap by translocation. A translocation is the
switching of parts between two chromosomes.
The BCR::ABL1 translocation can also be
written as t(9;22).
FISH can look for translocations that are
too small to be seen with other methods.
It can only be used for known changes.
It cannot detect all the possible changes
found within genes or chromosomes. A bone
marrow sample is often needed to get all the
information your care team needs to plan your
care.

Karyotype
A karyotype is a picture of
your chromosomes. The
study of chromosomes is
called cytogenetics.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 2025

15

2 Tests » Testing for CML biomarker and genetic changes

Karyotype

PCR

A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes.
Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. A
karyotype will show extra, missing, rearranged,
or abnormal pieces of chromosomes. Since a
karyotype requires growing cells, a sample of
bone marrow or blood must be used.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a
technique that can make millions or billions
of copies of your DNA or RNA (genetic
information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find
1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000
normal cells. These copies, called PCR
products, might be used for NGS.

Chromosome translocation and
gene rearrangement

qPCR (IS)
A special PCR called quantitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) is used in CML. It measures the
proportion of cells with the BCR::ABL1 gene
compared to normal cells with a gene needed
for maintaining basic cell functions (called
a housekeeping gene) such as ABL1. The
number found in your blood is compared to
an international standard or baseline called
the International Scale (IS). This is the most
important test for monitoring response to
treatment. Ask your care team if they are using
qPCR (IS). It is the gold standard for detecting
and measuring BCR::ABL1.

Chromosome translocation and gene
rearrangement is the switching of parts
between 2 chromosomes. When described
at the chromosome level, it is called a
translocation. When described at the gene
level, it is called rearrangement. For example,
a translocation between chromosome 9 and
22 is written as t(9;22) and is known as the
Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Its gene
rearrangement is written as BCR::ABL1.

Next-generation sequencing
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a
method used to determine a portion of a
person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene
has any mutations that might affect how the
gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more
detailed way than other methods and can find
mutations that other methods might miss.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 2025

A qPCR (IS) should be done at initial diagnosis
to look for the presence of the BCR::ABL1
gene on the Philadelphia chromosome. You
will have this test often after starting treatment.
This test might be referred to as real-time or
reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. The qPCR
level of BCR::ABL1 shows how your disease is
responding to CML therapy and is an important
measure of your progress.

2 Tests » Heart tests

Heart tests

Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram (or echo) uses sound
waves to make pictures. It is a type of
ultrasound. For this test, small patches will be
placed on your chest to track your heartbeat.
Next, a wand with gel on its tip will be slid
across part of your bare chest. A picture of
your beating heart will be seen on a screen.
The pictures will be recorded for future
viewing.

Heart or cardiac tests are used to see how well
your heart works. These tests might be used
to monitor treatment side effects. You might be
referred to a cardiologist.

Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows
electrical changes in your heart. It reveals
information about your heart rate and rhythm.
A prolonged corrected QT interval (or QTc)
occurs when your heart muscle takes longer
than normal to recharge between beats.
Often, this electrical disturbance can be seen
on an ECG. Certain treatments for CML can
cause a prolonged QTc. If the QTc becomes
too prolonged, it can cause dangerous heart
rhythms.

An echocardiogram is one way of measuring
ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood
pumped out of the left side of your heart every
time it beats. In low ejection fraction, the
amount of blood pumping from the left side of
the heart is lower than normal.

Seek out support groups at your
local hospital, through social
media, or through resources
listed in the back of this book.
Look to friends, relatives,
neighbors, and coworkers for
social support.

Care team

Get to know your care team and
help them get to know you.

Treating CML takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.

Your team might include the following
specialists:

A hematologist or hematologic
oncologist is a medical expert in blood
diseases and blood cancers.
A medical oncologist treats cancer in
adults using systemic (drug) therapy.
A pathologist or hematopathologist
analyzes the cells and tissues removed
during a biopsy and provides cancer
diagnosis, staging, and information about
biomarker testing.

3 Treating CML » Three phases of CML

Three phases of CML

Accelerated phase
The second phase of CML is called
accelerated phase (AP-CML). In this phase,
the number of myeloblasts is higher than
normal or there are chromosome changes
that suggest that the number of myeloblasts
is going to increase soon. The number of
white blood cells may also be high. Other cells
called promyelocytes and eosinophils may be
increased. There may be a very low number of
platelets in the blood caused by CML and not
by treatment. In the accelerated phase, CML
cells may grow faster.

CML can have three phases. Most people
with CML are diagnosed in the chronic phase,
but a small number can be diagnosed in the
accelerated or blast phase. Some people
with CML progress from chronic phase to
accelerated or blast phase.
The 3 phases of CML are:


Chronic



Accelerated



Blast

In all phases, CML cells contain the
Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+). However,
in the accelerated phase, there may be new
abnormal DNA changes (mutations) within
Ph+ cells.

Phases are based on the percentage of
immature white blood cells (blasts) found in
the blood and bone marrow. Normal bone
marrow contains up to 5 percent (5%) blasts.
This means that it is normal to have less than
5 blasts for every 100 blood cells. In CML the
number of blasts may be higher than 5%, but
is usually less than 15%. Fifteen percent or
more blasts is a sign of advanced phase CML.
Accelerated and blast phase are considered
advanced phases.

Blast phase
The third and final phase of CML is called blast
phase (BP-CML) or blast crisis. Once CML is
in blast phase, it can be life-threatening and
very difficult to treat. As a result, a major focus
of treatment of CML is to prevent blast phase.
Blast phase happens after a series of events,
including additional gene mutations and
resistance to targeted drug therapy. However,
some people are first diagnosed as having BPCML (before any treatment).

Chronic phase
The first phase of CML is called chronic phase
(CP-CML). In this phase, there is an increased
number of white blood cells in the blood, bone
marrow, or both. Less than 15 out of every 100
blood cells are myeloblasts (<15%).

A blast is a very immature white blood cell.
There is more than one type of white blood
cell. Both lymphoid and myeloid progenitor
cells form into blast cells called lymphoblasts
or myeloblasts depending on the type.
Blasts are committed to becoming a type of
blood cell. Lymphoblasts normally mature
into lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.
Myeloblasts are responsible for all other non-

CML typically progresses very slowly in the
chronic phase. It may take several months
or years to reach the next phase. Compared
to other phases, CP-CML typically responds
better to treatment.

3 Treating CML » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

lymphoid blood cells in bone marrow, such as
granulocytes, a type of white blood cell, as
well as platelets. However, in the blast phase
of CML, the normal maturation process is
impaired.




CML is treated with systemic therapy. Systemic
therapy is drug therapy that works throughout
the body. It includes targeted therapy,
immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. CML is
usually treated with targeted therapy. Goals of
systemic therapy should be discussed before
starting treatment. The choice of therapy takes
into consideration many factors, including
age, other serious health issues, and future
treatment possibilities like a hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT). Your preferences about
treatment are important. If you have any
religious or personal beliefs about certain kinds
of treatment, now would be the time to share
them with your care team.

In myeloid BP-CML, the number of
myeloblasts is very high, at least 30 out of
every 100 cells (30%).
In lymphoid BP-CML, any number of
abnormal lymphoblasts is concerning.

Blast cells may be found in tissues and organs
outside the bone marrow or blood. Treatment
for BP-CML is based on whether the blasts are
myeloid or lymphoid.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
normal cells.

Standard of care is the bestknown way to treat a particular
disease based on past clinical
trials. There may be more
than one treatment regimen
that is considered standard of
care. Ask your care team what
treatment options are available
and if a clinical trial might be
right for you.

3 Treating CML » Targeted therapy

Steroids
Steroid is the short name for corticosteroid.
Steroids are man-made versions of hormones
made by the adrenal glands. The adrenal
glands are small structures found near the
kidneys, which help regulate blood pressure
and reduce inflammation. Steroids also are
toxic to lymphoid cells and may be part of a
treatment. Steroids can cause short-term and
long-term side effects.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy is a form of systemic therapy
that focuses on specific or unique features of
cancer cells. Targeted therapies seek out how
cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the
body. These drugs stop the action of molecules
that help cancer cells grow and/or survive.

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:


Turmeric



Ginkgo biloba

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor



Green tea extract

A tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a type of
targeted therapy that blocks the signals that
cause cancer to grow and spread. TKIs might
be used alone or in combination with other
systemic therapies like chemotherapy and
immunotherapy.



St. John’s Wort



Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care
medicines given during systemic therapy.
Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.

Tyrosine kinases are proteins in cells that are
important for many cell functions. The protein
made by the BCR::ABL1 gene is a tyrosine
kinase. It moves or transfers chemicals, called
phosphates, from one molecule to another.
TKIs block this transfer, which stops the
uncontrolled cell growth in CML.
TKIs are slightly different from one another,
but they generally work in a similar way. They
may cause different side effects. You might

not be given a certain TKI if you have a health
condition, such as lung or heart issues, or
certain mutations. Sometimes, a TKI will stop
working if there’s a new drug-resistant mutation
in CML cells. Switching to a different TKI can
often help.

are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, talk to
your care team. There are options.

TKI side effects
TKIs can cause side effects. If you feel unwell
or a side effect is interfering with your ability
to do daily tasks, tell your care team. There
may be ways to help you feel better. It is very
important to continue to take your medicine
even if you do not feel well. Speak to your care
team before making any changes!

TKIs used to treat CML
TKIs that might be used to treat CML (listed in
alphabetical order):


Asciminib (Scemblix)



Bosutinib (Bosulif)



Dasatinib (Sprycel)



Imatinib (Gleevec)



Nilotinib (Tasigna)



Ponatinib (Iclusig)

Side effects are common among TKIs.
These include low blood counts, fatigue, and
musculoskeletal pain. You may feel nauseated,
have diarrhea, and vomit. Changes in your skin
may occur, such as a rash. You may feel tired
and get headaches and fevers. Fluid buildup
in limbs (edema) or around certain organs may
occur. Severe side effects include heart and
liver issues, and kidney failure. Do not take
TKIs while pregnant or breastfeeding. Talk to
your care team first before stopping any TKI.

TKIs are divided into first, second, and even
third generation. In general, each generation
of a drug gets more specific and better at
targeting certain mutations. This means that
second- and third-generation TKIs are usually
more specific, more potent, and better at
targeting certain mutations. However, they
might have more side effects. TKI options will
be based on your specific situation.

Asciminib
Asciminib is in a separate class because it
targets a different area of BCR::ABL1. It is a
treatment for those with chronic phase CML
with a BCR::ABL1 gene mutation called T315I
or may be used as a third-line treatment option
in those with chronic phase CML without
T315I. It should be avoided in people who
have had pancreatitis.

If CML doesn’t seem to be responding to one
TKI, then another TKI will be tried. Certain
drugs may work better and be less toxic. Dose
might be increased or decreased depending
on how CML is responding to treatment. You
will be closely monitored during treatment.

Bosutinib
Bosutinib is a second-generation TKI. It may
not be preferred for those who have liver
or stomach and digestion (gastrointestinal)
issues.

Breastfeeding
Those on TKI therapy should not breastfeed.
TKIs can pass into human breast milk. If you

3 Treating CML » Targeted therapy

Dasatinib
Dasatinib is a second-generation TKI. It may
not be prescribed if you have lung (pulmonary)
disease or breathing issues. There is a lowercost generic dasatinib option.

Sudden deaths have occurred in those taking
nilotinib. Nilotinib may cause increased blood
sugar or worsen peripheral vascular disease.
Nilotinib prolongs the QT interval, which is
detectable on an electrocardiogram (ECG or
EKG). You will likely have ECGs to monitor
your heart.

Imatinib
Imatinib was the first TKI approved by the U.S.
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to treat
CML. Imatinib has been studied for a long time
and is still a very good treatment option. It is a
good option for those who are older, who have
other more serious health issues, or for those
who have low-risk chronic phase CML where
an aggressive treatment might not be needed.
There is a lower-cost generic imatinib option.

Ponatinib
Ponatinib is a third-generation (3G) TKI. It
is the preferred treatment for those with a
BCR::ABL1 gene mutation called T315I,
but may be used as a second- or third-line
treatment option in those without T315I.
Ponatinib can have some serious side effects
and is not used as a first-line therapy. You
might be referred to a cardiologist to monitor
your heart if you receive this treatment.

Nilotinib
Nilotinib is a second-generation TKI. Nilotinib
may not be best for those who have heart
(cardiovascular) issues, are at risk for heart
issues, or who have electrolyte abnormalities.

Your preferences about
treatment are always
important. If you have
any religious or personal
beliefs about certain kinds
of treatment, share them
with your care team and
make your wishes known.
Together, you and your care
team will choose a treatment
plan that is best for you.

hours. The transplanted stem cells will travel
to your bone marrow and grow. New, healthy
blood cells will form. This is called engraftment.
It usually takes about 2 to 4 weeks. Until then,
you will have little or no immune defense. You
may need to stay in a very clean room at the
hospital or be given antibiotics to prevent or
treat infection. Transfusions are also possible.
A red blood cell transfusion is used to prevent
bleeding and to treat anemia (below normal
red blood cell count). A platelet transfusion is
used to treat a low platelet count or bleeding.
While waiting for the cells to engraft, you will
likely feel tired and weak. This treatment has
very serious and life-threatening side effects.

A hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) replaces
hematopoietic stem cells that have been
destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/
or radiation therapy as part of the transplant
process. A hematopoietic stem cell is a very
immature cell that can develop into any type of
blood cell. You might hear it called a stem cell
transplant (SCT) or a bone marrow transplant
(BMT). This book will refer to it as HCT. HCTs
are performed in specialized centers. Most
people with CML do not need an HCT.
There are 2 types of HCTs:



Possible side effects

Autologous – stem cells come from you.

Every treatment has side effects. You will be
monitored for infections, disease relapse, and
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In GVHD,
the donor cells attack your normal, healthy
tissue. There are treatments for GVHD. Ask
your care team about the possible side effects
or complications of HCT and how this might
affect your quality of life.

Allogeneic – stem cells come from a
donor who may or may not be related to
you. Only an allogeneic HCT is used as a
possible treatment option in CML.

Allogeneic HCT
An allogeneic HCT uses healthy stem cells
from a donor. The donor may or may not be
related to you. Before an HCT, treatment is
needed to destroy bone marrow cells. This is
called conditioning and it creates room for the
healthy donor stem cells. It also weakens the
immune system so your body will accept and
won’t kill the transplanted cells. Chemotherapy
is used for conditioning. Radiation therapy may
also be given as part of conditioning treatment.

More information on GVHD can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

After conditioning, you will receive a
transfusion of the healthy stem cells from
a donor that has been matched to you.
A transfusion is a slow injection of blood
products into a vein. This can take several

3 Treating CML » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
It depends on the clinical trial’s rules, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. They ensure that participants
are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as
safe as possible for the participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in a
lab, potential new ways of treating cancer need
to be studied in people. If found to be safe and
effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or
treatment approach may be approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a research
team. This group of experts will review the
study with you in detail, including its purpose
and the risks and benefits of joining. All of this
information is also provided in an informed
consent form. Read the form carefully and
ask questions before signing it. Take time to
discuss it with people you trust. Keep in mind
that you can leave and seek treatment outside
of the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment
and are done in phases.








Phase 1 trials study the safety and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.

Are clinical trials free?

Phase 4 trials study the safety and
benefit of an FDA-approved treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 2025

There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. But you may need
to pay for other services, like transportation or
childcare, due to extra appointments. During
the trial, you will continue to receive standard
cancer care. This care is often covered by
insurance.

3 Treating CML » General supportive care

General supportive care

All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important to tell your
care team about all of your side
effects so they can be managed.

Supportive care helps improve your quality
of life during and after cancer treatment. The
goal is to prevent or manage side effects
and symptoms, like pain and cancer-related
fatigue. It also addresses the mental, social,
and spiritual concerns faced by those with
cancer.
Supportive care is available to everyone with
cancer and their families, not just those at the
end of life. Palliative care is another name for
supportive care.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social health
issues, and second cancers. The sooner late
effects are treated the better. Ask your care
team about what late effects could occur. This
will help you know what to look for.

Supportive care can also help with:

Making treatment decisions



Coordinating your care



Paying for care



Planning for advanced care and end of
life

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause side effects.
Side effects depend on many factors. These
factors include the drug type and dose, length
of treatment, and the person. Some side
effects may be harmful to your health. Others
may just be unpleasant. Treatment can cause
several side effects. Some are very serious.
Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your care team about any
new or worsening symptoms. There may be
ways to help you feel better. There are also
ways to prevent some side effects. You will be
monitored closely for side effects.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 2025

A personalized survivorship care plan will
contain a summary of possible long-term
effects of treatment called late effects and list

provider will coordinate with specialists for
your follow-up care. As you age and the longer
you are on a TKI, consider incorporating other
team members such as cardio-oncologists.

Side effects

Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping problems
are common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicine that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Some potential side effects are described next.
They are not listed in order of importance.
Some side effects are very rare.
It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.

Fatigue

Anemia, neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia

Fatigue is a state of physical or mental
tiredness that can be characterized by a lack
of energy, motivation, or stamina. Fatigue
may be caused by cancer or it may be a side
effect of treatment. Let your care team know
how you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in
the way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating
a balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Some cancer treatments can cause low blood
cell counts.






Anemia is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to
your cells. You might tire easily if you are
anemic.
Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, the most common type of
white blood cell. This puts you at risk for
infection.

Infection
Infections occur more frequently and are more
severe in those with a weakened immune
system. Drug treatment for CML can weaken
the body’s natural defense against infections. If
not treated early, infections can be fatal.

Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Diarrhea

Neutropenia, a low number of white blood
cells, can lead to frequent or severe infections.
When someone with neutropenia also
develops a fever, it is called febrile neutropenia
(FN). With FN, your risk of severe infection
may be higher than normal. This is because
a low number of white blood cells leads to a
reduced ability to fight infections. FN is a side
effect of some types of systemic therapy.

Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how to
manage diarrhea. It is important to drink lots of
fluids.

important.

Overview
CML is often diagnosed during the chronic
phase of the disease. In this phase, there is an
increased number of white blood cells called
granulocytes in the blood, bone marrow, or
both. Less than 15 out of every 100 blood cells
are blasts (<15%) in chronic phase CML (CPCML).

of greater than 100%. Changes in qPCR
(IS) scores are often described in terms of
log changes. Log changes can decrease
or increase. A log increase means that the
value has gone up at least 10 times from the
lowest it has been. For example, an increase
of BCR::ABL1 to 1.2% from a previous value
of 0.12% would be a one log increase. A log
increase while being treated is cause for
concern and would prompt your oncologist to
re-evaluate your CML.

To see how well CML is responding to targeted
therapy, you will be monitored with qPCR
using the International Scale (IS). A qPCR (IS)
is the only tool sensitive enough to detect very
low levels of BCR::ABL1.

qPCR (IS) scores
The qPCR (IS) score uses a standard baseline
of 100%. This is the starting point or value
that your results are measured against. It is
the average of what is observed in untreated
individuals; it is possible to have a value

4 Chronic phase » Response milestones

Response milestones

Not meeting milestones
If treatment is not meeting certain milestones,
then it is possible your CML is resistant to the
TKI you are taking.

For CML, treatment results are discussed in
terms of response milestones. The goal is
to reach certain response milestones within
a specific timeframe and maintain those
milestones.

If this is the case, you will be asked if you:


Some important milestones are as follows:










Early molecular response (EMR)
is defined as BCR::ABL1 less than 10%
at 3 months and 6 months. It is a sign of
how well treatment will work in the long
term. The next milestone is complete
cytogenetic response by 12 months.

Are taking any medicines, over-thecounter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements, or if there were any
changes to other medicines you might
take for your heart, allergies, or digestion.

It is very important to tell your care team
about any teas you drink like green tea and
any supplements you take such as turmeric.
It might be one reason your treatment is not
working. Another reason might be that your
CML has a new drug-resistant mutation. Your
care team will consider this and order any
mutation or biomarker testing as needed.

Complete cytogenetic response
(CCyR) is the absence of the
Philadelphia chromosome (Ph-).
BCR::ABL1 is 1% or less. A CCyR should
be achieved within 12 months.
Major molecular response (MMR)
is defined as BCR::ABL1 less than 0.1%.
MMR can predict a deep molecular
response.

Second-line treatment

Deep molecular response (DMR)
is when BCR::ABL1 can’t be detected
except by the most sensitive of tests,
or cannot be detected at all. In a DMR,
BCR::ABL1 (IS) is at 0.01% or less.

Second-line treatment options are based on
qPCR (IS) results and if primary treatment
milestones were met. Response milestones
are measured as the percentage of cells
with BCR::ABL1 using qPCR (IS). The goal
is to reduce the number of CML cells with
BCR::ABL1 to less than 1% within 12 months.

For treatment milestones, see Guide 4.

4 Chronic phase » Treatment-free remission

Milestone not met

Treatment-free remission

If the BCR::ABL1 (IS) level is more than 10%
after 6 or more than 1% after 12 months, it
means that treatment milestones were not met
or maintained. If you have been taking your
medicine regularly, the next option is to switch
to another TKI (not imatinib) and consider
mutation testing. If a hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT) is an option in the future, you
might talk with a transplant expert.

For some, it may be possible to discontinue or
stop TKI therapy if all milestones have been
met. This is called treatment-free remission
(TFR). Your care team should consult with a
CML specialist and review with you in detail
the potential risks and benefits. You will need
to agree (consent) to stop therapy and be
aware of the TKI withdrawal side effects.
Frequent monitoring is needed for those
in remission who have stopped taking TKI
therapy. You will need to have blood tests
more often. This is to make sure that your
BCR::ABL1 level is closely monitored. If the
BCR::ABL1 level increases above 0.1%,
you will need to restart treatment. There is a
chance that your cancer might return (relapse)
if you stop taking the targeted therapy. Ask
your care team about the risks.

Possible TKI resistance
You might have possible TKI resistance if the
number of BCR::ABL1 (IS) cells:


Is more than 10% after 3 months



Is more than 1% after 12 months

You might have additional biomarker and
mutation testing before continuing treatment.
Since a treatment response can still occur with
more time, you might remain on the same TKI
or switch to a different TKI.

Milestone met
If milestones have been reached, you will
stay on your TKI. It’s very important not to
stop your medication without your doctor’s
advice or skip doses of your medicine. Missing
doses allows the leukemia cells to grow and
potentially develop TKI resistance. Monitoring
will continue indefinitely.

Milestone might have been
reached
For those with BCR::ABL1 (IS) between 0.1%
and 1% at 12 months, if the treatment goal is:




Long-term survival, then the milestone is
met and you will continue with the same
TKI.
Treatment-free remission (TFR), then the
milestone is not met. You might switch to
a different TKI, be referred to a center that
specializes in CML, or be recommended
for a clinical trial.

cells called granulocytes found in blood,
bone marrow, or both. Less than 15 out of
every 100 blood cells are blasts (<15%).
CP-CML is highly treatable.

In accelerated phase CML (AP-CML), the
blasts are myeloid. In blast phase CML (BPCML), the blasts can be myeloid or lymphoid.
This is different from chronic phase CML

In AP-CML and BP-CML, the
percentage of blasts is higher than
normal.
In BP-CML, myeloblasts or lymphoblasts
may be found in tissues and organs
outside the bone marrow or blood. Normal

Mutation testing



New mutations in the BCR::ABL1 gene may
occur over time. This can happen as CML
progresses to advanced phases or it can
happen during treatment for CML.




Mutation testing is used to look for these new
mutations. Testing can be performed on blood
or bone marrow. It should be done prior to
starting treatment for advanced phase CML
and for any convincing evidence of loss of
response to treatment. Some targeted therapies
will work on certain mutations, while others
will not. Therefore, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) chosen will be based on the type of gene
mutation(s). Discuss with your care team why
a certain treatment is being chosen and how
it might work better for your type and phase of
CML.

Is there any leukemia in your central
nervous system (CNS)?
What mutations does your CML have?
What TKIs did you take before? Did your
CML not respond or was it resistant to
certain TKIs?

Accelerated phase
In accelerated phase CML (AP-CML), the
percentage of myeloblasts is high. Platelet
count might be low. In all phases, CML cells
contain the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome.
However, in the accelerated and blast phases,
there may be new abnormal changes within
chromosomes.

Treatment options

Treatment planning

The treatment goal is to stop CML from
progressing to blast phase. For long-term
control, an allogeneic (donor) HCT is likely
needed. For treatment options, see Guide 6.

Factors such as your age, medical history,
test results, and any prior TKI therapy will
be used for treatment planning. The goal of
treatment is to stop CML from progressing to
accelerated or blast phase.

Guide 6
Treatment options: Accelerated phase

Your care team will consider the following
when planning treatment for advanced phase
CML:

5 Advanced phase » Blast phase

Blast phase

Blasts may be found in tissues and organs
outside the bone marrow or blood. A lumbar
puncture might be done if CML is suspected in
the fluid that surrounds the spine or brain.

The blasts in blast phase CML (BP-CML)
can be myeloid (myeloblasts) or lymphoid
(lymphoblasts).




An allogeneic (donor) HCT or intensive
chemotherapy would follow initial TKI
treatment for blast phase CML.

In myeloid blast phase, at least 30 out
of every 100 cells (30%) are blasts.
In lymphoid blast phase, any number
of abnormal lymphoblasts is concerning.

Blood cell formation
All blood cells start as blood stem cells. A blood stem cell has to go through many
stages to become a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet. CML affects the
myeloid progenitor cells and causes too many granulocytes (a type of white blood
cell). However, advanced phase CML can affect the lymphoid progenitor cells.

A hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is used to
prevent CML from progressing. It is a treatment
given to cure CML. However, this does not
always happen. An allogeneic HCT uses
healthy blood (hematopoietic) stem cells from a
donor who may or may not be related to you.

Clinical trial
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)type induction chemotherapy with a TKI
(preferred)
TKI with steroids

How your body responds to an HCT is based
on age, if you have other serious health issues
(comorbidities), donor type, and transplant
center. You will have qPCR (IS) after an
HCT to see if any cells with the Philadelphia
chromosome or BCR::ABL1 gene remain.

More information on ALL-type induction
therapies is available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

In a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR),
no Philadelphia chromosomes remain and
BCR::ABL1 level is 1% or less.

CCyR
Following an HCT, you will be monitored with
qPCR. This is done with blood, and/or bone
marrow. qPCR will be done every 3 months
for 2 years, then every 3 to 6 months. If
qPCR is negative, then you will continue to
be monitored. You might have TKI therapy for
at least one year after transplant if you had
accelerated phase CML (AP-CML) or blast

standardized baseline level.
molecular response
An improvement related to treatment, when
tests detect a decrease in the number of cells
that have the BCR::ABL1 gene.

second-line treatment
The next treatment used against a disease
after the first treatment failed or had to be
stopped.

mutation testing
A test that looks for abnormal changes in
genes (the coded instructions in cells for
making and controlling cells).

supportive care
Treatment for the symptoms or health
conditions caused by cancer or cancer
treatment.

myeloid
Referring to a type of white blood cell called a
granulocyte.

targeted therapy
Treatment with drugs that target a specific or
unique feature of cancer cells.

pathologist
A doctor who’s an expert in testing cells and
tissue to find disease.

transfusion
Replacing lost blood with new blood.

Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome
An abnormal, short chromosome 22 that is
formed when parts of chromosomes 9 and
22 switch with each other. It is the hallmark
of chronic myeloid leukemia and contains the
BCR::ABL1 gene.

translocation
When pieces of two chromosomes (long
strands of coded instructions for controlling
cells) break off and switch with each other.
treatment response
An outcome or improvement in disease that is
caused by treatment.

prognosis
The likely or expected course and outcome of
a disease.

tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
A type of drug that attaches to the BCR::ABL1
protein so that it can’t send growth signals.

quantitative reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
A very sensitive test that measures the number
of cells in the blood or bone marrow that have
the BCR::ABL1 gene.
relapse
The return or worsening of cancer after a
period of improvement.
remission
There are minor or no signs of a disease.
