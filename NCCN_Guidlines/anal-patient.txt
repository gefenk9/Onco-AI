Anal cancer basics

The anus

Anal cancer is an uncommon cancer
of the digestive system. Treatment
should involve a team of digestive
health experts with experience in
chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and
imaging. Everyone with anal cancer is
encouraged to consider enrolling in a
clinical trial for treatment if available.

Anal squamous cell carcinoma is the focus of
this patient guide. Other rare types not covered
here include anal adenocarcinoma and anal
melanoma. NCCN Guidelines for Patients® are
available on rectal cancer and melanoma.

The anus
The anus is the opening through which feces
(also called stool) exit the body. It is located
at the very end of the large intestine (bowel).
The colon is the first and longest section of
the large bowel. The rectum is defined as the
last several inches of the large bowel. Stool
is held in the rectum until it leaves the body
through the anus. The rectum and anus are
located within the pelvis. The pelvis is the area
of the body between the hip bones, below the
abdomen. Other organs in the pelvis include

Anal cancer most often starts in squamous
cells lining the canal that leads from the skin
surface into the rectum. Cancer that forms in
squamous cells is known as squamous cell
carcinoma. Squamous cells are found in the
tissues that form the surface of the skin and
in other areas of the body. Most colorectal
cancers, in contrast, start in glandular cells and
are called adenocarcinomas. This difference is
important in determining treatment options.

The anus
The anus is the opening
through which stool exits
the body. Anal cancer starts
in either the anal canal or
the perianal region. The anal
canal connects the rectum
and the anal opening. The
perianal region includes the
anal opening and the skin
directly surrounding it.

another does not. Cancers caused by HPV
include anal, cervical, head and neck, penile,
vaginal, and vulvar cancers.

the bladder, uterus, ovaries, vagina, and
prostate gland.
Anal cancer starts in either the anal canal or
the perianal region. The anal canal connects
the rectum and the anal opening. It is about
1 and a half inches (4 centimeters) long. The
anal canal is surrounded by muscles (anal
sphincters) that relax to allow stool to leave
the body through the anus. The perianal
region includes the anal opening and the skin
directly surrounding it. In some cases, an anal
tumor can involve both the anal canal and the
perianal skin.

There are more than 100 types (called strains)
of HPV. Infection with some strains is more
likely to lead to anal cancer and other related
cancers. High-risk forms of HPV include HPV16 and HPV-18. HPV infection can also cause
abnormal skin growths, called warts, to form
on the anus or genitals.

Other risk factors

The health- and lifestyle-related factors listed
below can also increase the risk of anal
cancer. Some of these factors lead to a higher
risk because they weaken the immune system.
This can can make it harder for the body to
clear HPV infection.

Risk factors
A risk factor is something that increases the
risk of developing a disease. Some people with
no known risk factors develop anal cancer.
And, some people with risk factors never get
anal cancer. Risk factors for anal cancer are
described next.

Human papillomavirus infection

The risk factor most strongly linked with anal
cancer is long-term infection with human
papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a sexually
transmitted virus. HPV is extremely common.
It affects almost everyone who has ever been
sexually active. Most people are unaware that
they are–or ever were–infected.
In most people, the immune system gets
rid of (“clears”) HPV from the body. In some
people, however, the virus causes long-term
cell changes that develop into cancer. The
progression to cancer often occurs decades
after the initial infection. Doctors are still
learning why one person gets anal cancer and

Risk reduction

Anal cancer starts as areas of abnormal
cells, called lesions, in or near the anus.
These pre-cancerous lesions are known as
anal dysplasia. Identifying and treating anal
dysplasia may prevent anal cancer. Other
names for anal dysplasia include:


Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion
(LSIL) (mild dysplasia)



High-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesion (HSIL) (moderate or severe
dysplasia)



Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN)



Stage 0 anal cancer

The most common symptom of anal cancer
is bleeding from the anus, also called rectal
bleeding. You may notice blood in your stool,
on toilet paper, or in the water of the toilet
bowl. Anal itching is also common. Some
people have pain in the anal area or feel like
there is a lump or mass near the anus.
These symptoms should not be ignored. They
may be commonly attributed to hemorrhoids.
Although they may be embarrassing to talk
about, it is important to be evaluated by a
health care professional. Most commonly,
people with these symptoms reach out to their
primary care physician (PCP), gynecologist,
or gastroenterologist. This is an important first
step. However, because anal cancer is fairly
rare, certain specialists are best qualified
to evaluate you. Such specialists include
colorectal surgeons and health care providers
trained to conduct a test called high-resolution
anoscopy (HRA). HRA typically takes place
after a digital rectal exam (DRE) is performed.

The HPV vaccine
A vaccine that protects against 9 different
strains of HPV, including the highest-risk
strains, is available. While previously only
recommended for routine use in adolescents
and young adults, vaccination is now an option
for adults aged 45 years and under. However,
it is most effective in younger people because
they have likely never been exposed to HPV.
Also, while the vaccine can prevent new
HPV infections, it does not treat existing HPV
infections or HPV-related cancers.

Digital rectal exam

The digital rectal exam (DRE) is an important
exam for diagnosis, staging, and follow-up.
There is nothing high-tech about a DRE.
Digit is another word for finger. In a DRE,
your doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated
finger into your anus and rectum. This finger
exam can detect or assess growths or other
abnormalities in the anal canal and nearby
areas.

High-resolution anoscopy (HRA)

HRA is a procedure that allows your health
care provider to view and examine the anal
canal with magnification. After a numbing gel

treatment may not be needed. However, close
follow-up that includes HRA and other testing
to check for spread to nearby lymph nodes
is needed. Most of the information in this
guide does not apply to SISCCA. This guide
applies to treatment of invasive anal cancer
diagnosed by biopsy and found to be more
advanced than SISCCA.

is applied to the anal area, a short, hollow
tool (an anoscope) is inserted a few inches
into the anus. Next, a liquid called acetic acid
is applied to the anal canal tissue. A special
magnifying glass called a colposcope is then
used to closely examine the tissues of the
anal canal. The acetic acid makes abnormal
cells appear differently when viewed with the
colposcope.

Testing after diagnosis

If abnormal or suspicious areas are seen,
a sample of tissue is removed and tested.
This is called a biopsy. This biopsy sample
may provide the diagnosis of anal cancer. If
a colposcope is not used for the procedure, it
is simply called standard anoscopy. HRA may
be more effective than standard anoscopy
at identifying anal cancer and anal dysplasia
(fast-growing abnormal cells).

After a biopsy confirms anal squamous
cell carcinoma, more testing is needed to
plan treatment. Digital rectal exams are
repeated. This section describes additional
recommended testing after diagnosis.

SISCCA

Lymph node exam
There are hundreds of small bean-shaped
structures called lymph nodes in the body.
Lymph nodes catch and filter out foreign
particles and harmful cells, including cancer
cells. Certain areas of the body contain more
lymph nodes than others. The groin (where
the thigh meets the abdomen) is one such
area. Lymph nodes in the groin are called the
inguinal lymph nodes. If left untreated, anal
cancer cells can travel through lymphatics
or blood to these groin lymph nodes or other
lymph nodes in the pelvis, and then to other
areas of the body.

Treatment for SISCCA is evolving. If the lesion
is completely removed during surgery, further

Lymph nodes cannot usually be seen or felt in
the early stages of cancer, but may become
enlarged as cancer progresses. Your doctor will
examine lymph nodes in the groin by pressing
on the surface of the skin. This is known as
palpation. If any lymph nodes feel enlarged
or look suspicious on imaging tests, a sample
may be removed for testing. A thin needle may
be used to remove a sample of tissue from the
node(s). This is called fine-needle aspiration
(FNA). In some cases, all or part of a lymph

No special preparations need to be taken
ahead of HRA. The procedure is brief (about
20 to 30 minutes), generally painless, and you
can go home afterwards. Some people have
minor bleeding and discomfort for a few days
following the procedure. Sometimes HRA is
done in the operating room under general
anesthesia.

Superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma
(SISCCA) is the earliest form of anal
cancer. These small lesions are often found
accidentally. They may be found during a
biopsy, or during removal of growths thought to
be non-cancerous. Such growths may include
genital warts, hemorrhoids, or anal skin tags.
These cancers are tiny (less than 7 mm wide,
smaller than a pea) and not deep at all.

Diagnosis and treatment planning
CT takes many pictures of areas inside of

the x-rays to make one detailed picture.
The picture is saved for later viewing by a
radiologist. You will lie face-up on a table that
moves through a tunnel-like machine.

node may be removed by cutting into the skin.
This is called an excisional biopsy.
Imaging
Imaging for anal cancer allows your doctors
to see areas inside the body in detail. Imaging
tests provide information on the extent of the
cancer and whether it has spread to distant
areas (metastasized).

A substance called contrast will be used to
make the pictures clearer. Before the CT scan,
you will be asked to drink a large glass of oral
contrast. A contrast agent may also be injected
into your vein. It may cause you to feel flushed
or get hives. Rarely, serious allergic reactions
occur. Tell your doctors if you have had bad
reactions to contrast in the past. You will be
alone during the scan, but a technician will be
right outside the room. You may hear buzzing
or clicking during the scan.

To learn the extent of anal cancer in the anus
and nearby areas (including lymph nodes),
either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended.
To look for areas of cancer beyond the pelvis,
a CT scan of the chest and abdomen with
contrast is recommended. In some cases,
positron emission tomography (PET) may be
combined with a CT or MRI. CT, MRI, and PET
are described below.

MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to
make pictures of areas inside the body. MRI
is especially good at making clear pictures of

Diagnosis and treatment planning
Gynecologic exam
A gynecologic exam, including screening for
cervical cancer, is recommended. Like anal
cancer, HPV is the cause of almost all cervical
cancers. Cervical cancer screening involves
scraping cells from the cervix and testing
them for HPV, cancer, and cell changes that
may lead to cancer. If testing for HPV is not
performed, it is simply called a Pap test. If the
cells are tested for both HPV and cancer, it is
called an HPV/Pap co-test.

areas of soft tissue. Unlike a CT scan, MRI
does not use radiation. Tell your doctor know if
you have issues with small enclosed spaces.
CT or MRI may be combined with positron
emission tomography (PET). PET involves first
injecting radioactive glucose (sugar) into the
body. The radioactive sugar is detected with a
special camera during the scan. Cancer cells
appear brighter than normal cells because they
use sugar more quickly.
HIV testing
People with HIV are at increased risk of
developing anal cancer. It is important to
know your HIV status. If you have not been
tested for HIV, your provider may recommend
that you get tested. If you have HIV, getting
the care you need may also improve cancer
treatment outcomes.

MRI
You may have an MRI to
determine the extent of
the cancer in the pelvis.
MRI uses a magnetic field
and radio waves to make
pictures of areas inside
the body. Unlike a CT
scan, MRI does not use
radiation.

Staging

Staging

Stage I

In stage I anal cancer, the tumor is 2 cm or
smaller. Cancer has not spread to nearby
lymph nodes or to areas far from the anus.
Stage I anal cancer is described as T1, N0,
M0.

The results of testing are used to determine
the cancer stage. The stage is an assessment
of the extent of cancer in the body. The tumor,
node, metastasis (TNM) system developed
by the American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) is used to stage anal cancer. This
system is used to stage both anal canal
and perianal tumors. Three key pieces of
information are used to determine the stage:

Stage II

Stage II anal cancer is divided into 2 substages, depending on the size of the tumor.
Anal tumors larger than 2 cm but not
larger than 5 cm are stage IIA. This stage
is described as T2, N0, M0. Anal tumors
larger than 5 cm are stage IIB. This stage is
described as T3, N0, M0.

T: The size and extent of invasion of the anal
tumor. Tumors are measured in centimeters
(cm). Approximately 2 and a half cm make up
one inch.
N: Whether any lymph nodes near the anus
have cancer

Stage II anal cancers have not spread to
nearby lymph nodes or to areas far from the
anus.

M: Whether the cancer has metastasized
(spread) to areas far from the anus, such as
the liver or lungs

Stage III

Stage III anal cancer is divided into 3 substages. There may be cancer in nearby lymph
nodes.

It is important for the cancer to be staged
accurately. This helps determine the best
treatment plan. It also suggests how likely the
cancer is to be cured using current treatments.

In stage IIIA, the anal tumor is 5 cm or smaller
and there is cancer in nearby lymph nodes.
This stage is described as either T1, N1, M0 or
T2, N1, M0.

Precancer

There are abnormal cells on the surface
of the anal canal or perianal region. These
lesions may develop into cancer. Names for
anal precancer include stage 0 anal cancer,
anal dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, high-grade
anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), and highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL).
Treatment may involve close monitoring,
electrocautery by an HRA provider, or surgical
removal.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Anal Cancer, 2022

In stage IIIB, the tumor has invaded nearby
organs (such as the vagina, urethra, or
bladder), but there is no cancer in nearby
lymph nodes. This stage is described as T4,
N0, M0.
In stage IIIC, the tumor is larger than 5 cm
or has invaded nearby organs. Cancer has
spread to nearby lymph nodes. This stage is
described as either T3, N1, M0 or T4, N1, M0.

Fertility and family planning

Fertility and family planning

Stage IV

The cancer is metastatic. This means it has
spread to areas beyond the pelvis, such as
the liver or lungs. Stage IV anal cancer is
described as T (may be 1, 2, 3, or 4), N (0 or
1), M1.

Anal cancer treatment almost always involves
radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can cause
or contribute to infertility, which is the inability
to produce children. Radiation damages the
ovaries and causes them to stop making
hormones needed for natural pregnancy.
Chemotherapy can also cause infertility in
some cases by damaging sperm or eggs.

Staging and treatment

Stages I, II, and III anal cancer are nonmetastatic (have not spread to distant sites).
These stages are potentially curable. With
the exception of some early-stage perianal
cancers, treatment with chemotherapy and
radiation (chemoradiation) is recommended for
most non-metastatic anal cancers, regardless
of the stage. The goal of treatment for these
stages is to cure the cancer. The primary
(main) treatment for metastatic anal cancer, in
contrast, is chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
The goal of treatment for metastatic anal
cancer is usually to help you live longer and
to help with symptoms. Detailed treatment
information is provided in Part 2: Treatment
guide.

If you want the option of having children after
treatment or are unsure, tell your doctor.
There are ways to be able to have children
after cancer treatment. This is called fertility
preservation. If you are of childbearing
age, your doctor will discuss any fertilityrelated risks of your treatment plan with you.
You may be referred for counseling about
fertility preservation options. Some fertility
preservation options are described below.

Sperm banking

Sperm banking stores semen for later use by
freezing it in liquid nitrogen. The medical term
for this is semen cryopreservation.

“

Egg freezing

Like sperm banking, unfertilized eggs can
be removed, frozen, and stored for later
use. The medical term for this is oocyte
cryopreservation.

Because anal cancer is rare and
stigmatized, it is harder to find
others who have been through it.

Ovarian tissue banking

Anal canal cancer (stages I – III)

Anal cancer starts in either the anal
canal or the perianal region. Treatment
with chemotherapy and radiation
(chemoradiation) is recommended for
most non-metastatic anal cancers.
Surgery to remove the anus may
be needed for cancer that does not
respond to treatment or that returns
after treatment. Metastatic anal cancer
is treated with systemic therapy
(chemotherapy or immunotherapy).

called a linear accelerator. The radiation
passes through skin and other tissue to reach
the tumor.
All types of EBRT are conformal, which means
that the radiation beams are shaped to the
tumor. What makes IMRT unique compared
to other forms of EBRT is that it uses many
small beams of different intensities (strengths).
This allows a high dose of radiation to be
targeted at the tumor while limiting the amount
of radiation to the surrounding normal tissue.
With IMRT it is possible to reduce radiation to
important nearby organs and structures, such
as external genitalia and hip joints. This can
help reduce treatment-related side effects.

Anal canal cancer (stages I – III)

Radiation therapy is given in small doses,
called fractions. As part of chemoradiation for
anal cancer, radiation is typically given Monday
through Friday for 5 to 6 weeks (25 to 30
treatment sessions).

This section provides treatment
recommendations for stages I, II, and III
anal canal cancer. These stages are nonmetastatic, meaning the cancer has not spread
beyond the pelvis. See page 26 for information
on metastatic anal cancer.

A planning session, called simulation, is
needed before treatment begins. If IMRT is
planned, you will most likely lie on your back
with your knees out to the side (“frog-legged”)
for simulation and for treatment. Pictures of the
cancer sites will be obtained with a CT scan.
Using the pictures and sophisticated computer
software, the radiation team will plan the best
radiation dose and number of treatments.

Chemoradiation

Chemoradiation is the recommended primary
(main) treatment for non-metastatic anal canal
cancer. Chemoradiation involves treatment
with both chemotherapy and radiation therapy
during the same time period. More information
on this combined treatment approach is
provided next.

During treatment, you will lie on a table as you
did for simulation. Devices may be used to
keep you from moving. This helps to target the
tumor. Ink marks on your skin will help position
your body accurately for daily treatments. Your
radiation oncologist will devise a treatment
plan to aim radiation beams at the anal tumor
and lymph nodes in the pelvis and groin.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy most often uses highenergy x-rays to kill cancer cells. An advanced
radiation technique called intensity-modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) is the preferred
method for treating anal cancer. It is a type
of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).
In EBRT, radiation is delivered from outside
(external to) the body using a large machine

effects may not be felt immediately. They can
appear and worsen later in the cycle or even
after it is complete.

You will be alone in the treatment room. A
technician will operate the machine from a
nearby room. The technician will be able to
see, hear, and speak with you at all times. As
treatment is given, you may hear noises. You
will not see, hear, or feel the radiation. One
session can take less than 10 minutes.

Radiation therapy for anal cancer can also
have long-term and potentially serious side
effects on fertility, sexual health, and bowel
and bladder function. See “Fertility and family
planning” on page 14 and Part 3: Survivorship
for information on ways to help prevent, limit,
or manage these effects.

Common side effects at the treatment site
during the 5 to 6 weeks of radiation treatment
include skin irritation, tenderness, redness,
and sores or skin breakdown. Discuss the
use of over-the-counter ointments with
your radiation oncologist. Over-the-counter
ointments like Aquaphor or Silvadene can
soothe the skin and help with healing.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer
medicines. It is a type of systemic therapy.
Most commonly, chemotherapy is given
intravenously. This means the medicine(s) are
slowly infused into the body through a vein.
The medicine(s) travel in the bloodstream
to reach cells throughout the body.
Chemotherapy can also be given orally.

Other short-term side effects of radiation
therapy include diarrhea, fatigue, frequent
urination or pain while urinating, and nausea.
Most of these decrease over time when
treatment is over. Radiation therapy side

Radiation therapy
An advanced radiation
technique called
intensity-modulated
radiation therapy
(IMRT) is the preferred
method for treating
anal cancer.

Treatment guide

Anal canal cancer (stages I – III)
The 5-FU is stored in a small, wearable
pump connected to the catheter. The pump
infuses the medicine into the body very
slowly, over several days. The tube, called a
central venous catheter, stays in place for the
duration of treatment. It allows you to receive
chemotherapy with 5-FU from home.

At this time, chemotherapy regimens
recommended for use with radiation therapy to
treat stage I, II, and III anal cancer include:


Mitomycin and capecitabine



Mitomycin and 5-FU



5-FU and cisplatin

The first 5-FU infusion starts when radiation
therapy begins and lasts for 4 to 5 days. You
will have another 4- to 5-day infusion at the
start of week 5 of radiation therapy. The pump
will be disconnected and removed between
infusions.

While you undergo chemotherapy with one
of the above regimens, you will also receive
treatment with radiation therapy 5 days per
week. These chemotherapy regimens are
described in more detail next.
Mitomycin and capecitabine is a commonly
used regimen. Capecitabine is taken by
mouth twice daily, Monday through Friday
(on radiation days only), for 5 and a half to
6 weeks. You will be undergoing radiation
therapy during the same time period. On the
day you begin taking capecitabine, a single
intravenous dose of mitomycin will be given.
Another dose of mitomycin is usually given at
the start of week 5.

A single dose of mitomycin is given on the first
day of the first 5-FU infusion. Another dose
of mitomycin may be given when the second
5-FU infusion begins, towards the end of
radiation therapy.

Mitomycin and 5-FU is another regimen
recommended for use with radiation therapy.
5-FU is given by continuous (constant) infusion
over several days. You do not need to stay at
a treatment center during this time, however.
Before chemotherapy begins, a thin, flexible
tube will be inserted into a vein in your upper
chest, below the collarbone. This is referred to
as a “port.” Using a small wire and often x-ray
guidance, the tube is guided to a large vein
above the right side of the heart. Some people
receive a temporary PICC line instead. A PICC
line is a deep IV that stays in the arm for the
duration of treatment.

Chemotherapy can kill normal, healthy cells
in addition to cancer cells. The damage to
healthy cells causes potentially harsh side
effects. The most common side effects of the
chemotherapy regimens discussed above are
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sores in the mouth
and lining of the anus, and low blood cell
counts. Low white blood cell counts can make
you prone to infections. Talk to your treatment
team about ways to prevent or lessen these
side effects.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Anal Cancer, 2022

Another option for chemotherapy is 5-FU and
cisplatin. 5-FU is given as described above.
Cisplatin is given intravenously on the first day
of 5-FU infusions.

Capecitabine can cause a side effect known
as hand-foot syndrome. Symptoms include
redness, swelling, and pain on the palms of
the hands, bottoms of feet, or both. Sometimes

be changed at the earliest signs of hand-foot
syndrome.

This section provides treatment
recommendations for stages I, II, and III
perianal cancer. Stages I through III are nonmetastatic, meaning the cancer has not spread
beyond the pelvis. See page 26 for information
on metastatic anal cancer.

Next steps

See Follow-up and surveillance on page 23 for
next steps.

Like anal canal cancer, most perianal cancers
are treated with chemoradiation. However,
local excision (surgery) may be an option for
some early-stage, low-risk perianal cancers.
Local excision involves removing only the
tumor and a small area of surrounding tissue.

Local excision

Local excision is a recommended treatment
option for some stage I and stage IIA perianal
cancers. Stage I and II anal cancers have not
invaded nearby lymph nodes. See page 13 for
more information on cancer staging. For local
excision to be an option, the cancer must not
have invaded the sphincter muscle.

We want your
feedback!
Our goal is to provide helpful
and easy-to-understand
information on cancer.

The cancer grade is also important when
determining if local excision is an option. The
cancer grade is a rating of how fast the cancer
is expected to grow and spread. It is based
on how abnormal the cancer cells look when
viewed under a microscope. Higher scores
mean that the cancer is likely to grow and
spread quickly. There are 5 possible grades:

Chemoradiation

Local excision should only be considered
for low-grade (G1) and intermediate-grade
(G2) perianal cancers.

Chemoradiation is recommended for all nonmetastatic perianal cancers that do not meet
the criteria for local excision. This includes:

The normal tissue surrounding the lesion
removed during surgery is called the surgical
margin. If a margin of at least 1 cm is removed
and it does not contain cancer cells, no further
treatment is needed. The cancer will be
observed. See Follow-up and surveillance on
page 22 for next steps.
If a margin of less than 1 cm is removed
or if the tissue contains cancer cells, more
treatment is needed. The preferred next
treatment is another surgery (re-excision).
Another option is radiation therapy with or
without chemotherapy. If this treatment option
is planned, chemotherapy regimens that may
be used with radiation include:

possible due to discomfort or pain. In this case,
you and your doctor may decide together to
omit it or perform it less often than every 6 to
12 months.

After finishing treatment for anal cancer, you
will have testing to find early signs that cancer
may have returned. This is called surveillance.
Surveillance for the return of anal canal cancer
and perianal cancer is the same.

Imaging
For stage II and III anal cancers in complete
remission after treatment, surveillance also
includes imaging. Imaging is recommended
every year for 3 years. You should have a
CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with
contrast, or a CT of the chest without contrast
and an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with
contrast.

A follow-up physical exam with digital
rectal examination (DRE) and anoscopy is
recommended 8 to 12 weeks after completing
chemoradiation to check the results of
treatment. Your doctor may also order imaging
tests. Depending on the results, the cancer is
assigned to 1 of the following categories:


Complete remission – there are no signs
of cancer in the body



Persistent disease – cancer remains in
the body but has not grown or spread



Progressive disease – the cancer has
grown or spread

Other care
In addition to surveillance testing, a range
of other care is important for anal cancer
survivors. See Part 3: Survivorship for
more information. If cancer returns during
surveillance, see Recurrence on page 24.

Persistent disease

If cancer is found during initial follow-up
examination, it does not mean that treatment
failed. Some anal cancers take longer to
respond to treatment than others. It may be
safe to monitor the cancer for as long as
6 months after treatment to see if there is
improvement. Waiting to see if the cancer
improves may avoid the need for surgery to
remove the anus. If the cancer does not go
into complete remission or gets worse, see
“Progressive disease” below. If the cancer
goes into remission, surveillance as described
above under “Complete remission” is started.

Complete remission

If initial follow-up testing finds no signs of
cancer, recommended surveillance going
forward is described below.
Digital rectal exams
DREs are recommended every 3 to 6 months
for 5 years after treatment.
Lymph node exams
Inguinal lymph node exams are recommended

certain. If biopsy results confirm progression,
the next step is imaging. Imaging can show if
the cancer is limited to the anal area (locally
progressive) or whether it has spread to areas
far from the pelvis (metastatic disease). See
page 26 for information on the treatment of
metastatic anal cancer.
Treatment for locally progressive anal
cancer is similar to recurrent non-metastatic
anal cancer. Surgery to remove the anus is
recommended. See Recurrence on the next
page for more information.

Before proceeding with surgery, your doctor
may recommend trying immunotherapy with
an immune checkpoint inhibitor. In some
anal cancer patients, immunotherapy worked
well enough that surgery was not needed.
However, there is not much research available
on this treatment approach. Talk to your
doctor about the possible benefits and risks of
delaying surgery to try immunotherapy.

Recurrence

Recurrence

In addition to the anus, APR typically involves
removing the rectum, the area where the
rectum and colon meet, and the fatty tissue
surrounding the rectum. Lymph nodes in the
groin will also be removed during surgery if
any are known to have cancer. This is known
as a groin dissection.

Recurrence is the return of cancer after a
cancer-free period. Treatment depends on
whether the cancer returns to the anus, to
lymph nodes near the anus, or to distant areas
such as the liver or lungs. See page 26 for
information on the treatment of metastatic anal
cancer.

Radiation treatment for anal cancer weakens
and damages the perineum, which can
interfere with healing after APR. In some
cases, closing the wound requires taking
tissue from another area of the body. This is
known as muscle flap reconstruction. It can
improve healing of the perineum and reduce
complications after surgery. A muscle in the
lower abdomen called the rectus abdominis,
along with skin, fat, and blood vessels, is often
used for reconstruction. If APR is planned, ask
your doctor about muscle flap reconstruction.

If cancer returns to the anus

If cancer returns to the anal area, surgery to
remove the anus is recommended. This type of
surgery is called abdominoperineal resection
(APR). APR is a fairly radical surgery that
requires cutting into the abdomen and into
the area between the anus and genitals (the
perineum) to reach and remove the cancer.
This type of surgery is also used for some
rectal cancers.

Abdominoperineal resection (APR)
APR may be needed for anal cancer that does not respond to initial treatment or that returns
after treatment. It involves removing the anus and creating a permanent colostomy for stool
to leave the body.

Recurrence
No prior radiation therapy
If you did not receive radiation therapy as
part of initial treatment, it can be used to treat
cancer that returns to the inguinal (groin)
lymph nodes. Chemotherapy with one of the
following regimens may be given in addition to
radiation:

Removing the anus means there is no natural
way for stool to exit the body. A permanent
colostomy is needed. A colostomy connects
the end of the colon to the outside of the
abdomen. This creates an opening, called a
stoma, on the surface of the abdomen. Stool
exits the body through the stoma and goes into
a bag attached to the skin.

If cancer returns to lymph nodes

Treatment of cancer found in lymph nodes
during surveillance depends on whether
radiation was used as part of initial treatment.



5-FU and cisplatin

5-FU and mitomycin

Lymph node exams
Inguinal lymph node exams are recommended
every 3 to 6 months for 5 years after any type
of treatment for recurrence.
Digital rectal exams
If you had treatment for cancer in lymph nodes
only (you did not have APR), digital rectal
exams (DREs) are recommended every 3 to 6
months for 5 years.
Anoscopy
If you had treatment for cancer in lymph
nodes only (you did not have APR), anoscopy
is recommended every 6 to 12 months for
3 years. In some patients, after treatment
with radiation therapy, anoscopy may not be
possible due to discomfort or pain. In this case,
you and your doctor may decide together to
omit it or perform it less often than every 6 to
12 months.

Research suggests that carboplatin and
paclitaxel may be preferred over 5-FU and
cisplatin, but both regimens are standard
options.

Prior radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is almost always used as

further radiation therapy may be considered
in select cases. Otherwise, a lymph node
dissection may be needed. If APR is planned,
the cancerous lymph nodes will be removed
during APR. If APR is not planned, a lymph
node dissection can be performed as a
standalone surgery.

capecitabine will be used for the chemotherapy
portion.

This section provides treatment
recommendations for anal cancer that has
spread beyond the pelvis. If available, enrolling
in a clinical trial for treatment is encouraged.
If anal cancer metastasizes, it spreads most
often to the liver or lungs. Metastatic anal
cancer is treated first with platinum-based
chemotherapy. This is called first-line therapy.
Options recommended at this time include:


Carboplatin and paclitaxel



5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin
(FOLFOX)

5-FU, leucovorin, and cisplatin (FOLFCIS)

Side effects of chemotherapy

The most common side effects of the
chemotherapy regimens discussed above
are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, and
sores in the mouth and lining of the anus.
Platinum-based chemotherapy medicines,
including carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin,
can damage the kidneys. Many people cannot
have cisplatin because their kidneys do not
work well or because of other health issues.
To reduce the effect on the kidneys, individuals
receiving platinum-based chemotherapy may
receive routine IV hydration.
Extended treatment with cisplatin may also
cause hearing problems or hearing loss.
Extended treatment with oxaliplatin can cause
nerve damage to your fingers and toes.
Symptoms include numbness, cramping,
tingling, or pain in these areas.

5-FU and cisplatin

Ask your treatment team to explain:


How often you need to receive
chemotherapy



How long you need to receive
chemotherapy



How chemotherapy treatment will be
given (eg, intravenously, orally, infusion
pump)

Ask your treatment team for a complete list of
possible side effects of each systemic therapy
you are receiving. There are ways to prevent
or alleviate some of these side effects.

Radiation therapy for metastatic cancer
Treatment with radiation therapy in addition
to chemotherapy is an option for cancer that
metastasized before it was diagnosed (stage
IV anal cancer) and that has therefore never
been treated with radiation. If there is a limited
number of small metastases, a special type
of radiation therapy called stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT) may be used.

After chemotherapy with certain regimens,
treatment with chemoradiation may be given.
The extent of the cancer will be re-checked
when you have finished chemotherapy. This
will help guide decisions about chemoradiation.
Chemoradiation is generally not considered
after chemotherapy with the modified DCF
(docetaxel, cisplatin, fluorouracil) regimen.
If chemoradiation is planned, either 5-FU or

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Treatment guide

If the cancer metastasizes after initial
treatment that included radiation, radiation
therapy cannot be used again to treat the
same areas. Palliative radiation therapy
may be an option if the cancer is causing
symptoms. Palliative radiation therapy can
limit the size of the tumor(s) and help with
symptoms. If palliative radiation is planned,
care will be taken to ensure that areas initially
treated with radiation are not treated a second
time.

Progression

If the cancer progresses during or after
treatment with chemotherapy, immunotherapy
is recommended if you are eligible.
Immunotherapy increases the activity of your
immune system, improving your body’s ability
to find and destroy cancer cells. It is a type
of systemic therapy. Nivolumab (Opdivo)
and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are immune
checkpoint inhibitors currently used to treat
metastatic anal cancer.

Clinical trials

Clinical trials

cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.


Phase I trials study the safety and side
effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.



Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.



Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefits of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Start the conversation

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. Try not to
be discouraged if you cannot join. New clinical
trials are always becoming available.

Frequently asked questions

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you

Optimize your diet
Changing your diet can help with bowel
problems, including frequency, urgency,
and fecal incontinence. Eating foods high
in insoluble (not soluble) fiber and taking
fiber supplements can help. Psyllium-based
products (Metamucil, for example) may help
slow and thicken the stool. Ask your treatment
team for a list of foods that may help with
bowel changes after anal cancer treatment,
as well as a list of foods to avoid. There is a
lot to know about oncology nutrition. Many
anal cancer survivors find it helpful to talk to
a dietitian that specializes in the nutritional
needs of anal cancer, or digestive system
cancer, survivors.

Sexual side effects can occur after anal cancer
treatment, including:
Difficulty getting an erection



Reduced sex drive (libido)



Vaginal dryness



Pain during sex



Narrowing and shortening of the vagina

Vaginal dilator therapy
Radiation therapy to the pelvic area can
cause the vagina to become shorter and
narrower. This is called vaginal stenosis.
Vaginal stenosis can make it uncomfortable or
even painful to have sex, or to have vaginal
examinations by a doctor. Vaginal dilator
therapy can help during and after radiation
therapy. A vaginal dilator is a device used to
gradually stretch or widen the vagina. Vaginal
dilators are not one-size-fits-all. Different sizes
are available, as are dilator kits containing
different size devices. The size of the dilator
can be increased over time as the vagina
lengthens and widens.

Pelvic floor physical therapy
The pelvic floor is a group of muscles that
supports the organs of the pelvis. These
muscles play a key role in bowel and bladder
control and well as sexual function and
arousal. There are ways to strengthen these
muscles before and after treatment. This
is known as pelvic floor physical therapy,
and there are health care professionals that
specialize in it. Ask your treatment team for
help finding a pelvic floor specialist in your
area. Pelvic floor therapy can include at-home
exercises to tighten and release the vaginal
and anal muscles (Kegel exercises) as well as
hands-on techniques by a physical therapist.

Sexual health therapists
While it may be uncomfortable to talk about
sexual health, keep in mind that these
side effects are common and can often be
managed or lessened. Consider seeing a
sexual health therapist. These health care
professionals specialize in helping cancer
survivors and others overcome and manage
sexual side effects of cancer treatment. Many
cancer treatment centers have programs
focused solely on sexual health after anal
cancer treatment. Ask your doctor about
resources available through your cancer center

health and wellness for cancer survivors.
Social workers at your treatment site are often
excellent resources to help connect you with
mental health and financial resources.

Mental health and wellness

The effects of anal cancer and its treatment
can be difficult to cope with. Many survivors
report having an overall lower quality of life
after cancer treatment. In addition to effects
on bowel, bladder, and sexual function,
more general effects such as fatigue, trouble
breathing (dyspnea), and difficulty sleeping
(insomnia) are common. Many anal cancer
survivors are also hesitant to share their
diagnosis out of a fear of being judged by
others. This can be isolating and distressful.

For more information see the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Distress During
Cancer Care at NCCN.org/patientguidelines.

Tell your treatment team about these
symptoms. If you are anxious, distressed,
depressed, or are just having trouble coping
with life after cancer, you are not alone. Expect
your treatment team to ask about your mental
health. If they don’t, speak up. There are many
resources available that can improve mental

Ostomy care

If you have an ostomy, you may want to join
an ostomy support group. Another option is
to see a health care provider that specializes
in ostomy care, such as an ostomy nurse.
People with ostomies can still live very active
lifestyles. However, it’s a good idea to consult
with an ostomy professional before any
vigorous or high-intensity physical activity.

You will get through this. It might
seem hard at times toward the
end of treatment and the following
weeks and months while you
recover, but it will pass. I tried to

with their doctor before starting a new exercise
regimen. Eat a healthy diet with lots of plantbased foods.

Monitoring for the return of anal cancer is
important after finishing treatment. But, it is
also important to keep up with other aspects
of your health. Steps you can take to help
prevent other health issues and to improve
your quality of life are described next.

Talk to your doctor about taking aspirin every
day to prevent future cancers.
Radiation treatment to the pelvis can weaken
bones in the pelvis, putting you at increased
risk of fractures. Your doctor may want to start
monitoring the density of your bones.

Get screened for other types of cancer, such
as breast, cervical, colorectal, or prostate
cancer. Your primary care doctor should tell
you what cancer screening tests you should
have based on your sex, age, and risk level.

Alcohol can increase the risk of certain
cancers. Drink little to no alcohol.

Get other recommended health care such
as blood pressure screening, hepatitis C
screening, and immunizations (such as the flu
shot).

If you smoke, quit! Your doctor will be able to
provide (or refer you for) counseling on how to
stop smoking.

Leading a healthy lifestyle includes maintaining
a healthy body weight. Try to exercise at a
moderate intensity for at least 150 minutes per
week. All patients should have a discussion

Experts recommend eating
a healthy diet, especially
one that includes a lot of
plant-based foods (veggies,
fruits, and whole grains).

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice | Questions to ask

It is important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your doctor.

when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

Second opinion

It is normal to want to start treatment as
soon as possible. While cancer should not
be ignored, there is time to have another
doctor review your test results and suggest a
treatment plan. This is called getting a second
opinion, and it’s a normal part of cancer care.
Even doctors get second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.
Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Questions to ask

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
If you take the time to build a relationship with
your doctor, it will help you feel supported

Anal Cancer, 2022

Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these or come up with your own. Be clear about
your goals for treatment and find out what to
expect from treatment. Keep a notebook handy
to record answers to your questions.

Words to know

Words to know

human papillomavirus (HPV)
A virus that affects almost everyone who
has been sexually active. HPV can cause
abnormal tissue growth (for example, warts)
and other changes to cells. Anal cancer is
almost always caused by HPV infection.

abdominoperineal resection (APR)
A type of surgery that may be needed for
anal cancer that does not respond to initial
treatment or that returns after treatment. APR
removes the anus, rectum, nearby cancerous
lymph nodes, and other tissues. A permanent
colostomy is needed.

infertility
The inability to produce children.
inguinal lymph nodes
Lymph nodes in the groin.

anal canal
The small section of the large intestine that
connects the rectum and the anal opening.

intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT)
A type of external radiation therapy that
uses many beams of different intensities. A
recommended type of radiation therapy for
anal cancer.

anal sphincter
A ring-shaped muscle around the opening of
the anus that relaxes or tightens to open or
close the anus.

libido
Sexual desire or the mental energy or emotion
related to sex.

anus
The opening at the end of the large bowel
through which stool exits the body.

perianal region
The anal opening and the skin directly
surrounding it.

chemoradiation
The use of both chemotherapy and radiation
therapy during the same time period
(concurrently) to treat cancer. A commonly
used initial treatment for anal cancer.

systemic therapy
Cancer treatment with medicines that travel
through the bloodstream, reaching and
affecting cells all over the body. Chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are
types of systemic therapy.

clinical trial
A research study using investigational
treatments that may, in time, be approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

vaginal stenosis
A condition in which the vagina becomes
narrower and shorter. The lining of the vagina
may also be thinner and drier and contain scar
tissue. This can cause pain during sex and
pelvic exams. Vaginal stenosis is often caused
by radiation therapy to the pelvis or some
types of surgery.

colostomy
A surgery that allows stool to leave the
body after the anus is removed. The end of
the bowel is attached to an opening in the
surface of the abdomen. Stool is collected in a
disposable bag outside of the body.
