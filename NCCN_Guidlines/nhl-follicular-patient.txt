About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for B-Cell Lymphomas Version 2.2024 – April 30, 2024.

Lymphatic system

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a
slow-growing (indolent) non-

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) begins in the
lymphatic system. The lymphatic or lymph
system is a major part of the body’s immune
system. It is a germ- and cancer-fighting
network of tissues and organs that includes the
bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes,
and lymphatic vessels.

Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). NHLs
develop from B lymphocytes, a
type of white blood cell. In FL,
excess amounts of abnormal
B lymphocytes form clusters

Lymphatic vessels are a network of thin tubes
that carry lymphatic fluid (lymph) and white
blood cells into all the tissues of the body.
White blood cells, such as lymphocytes cells,
help fight infection and other diseases.

(follicles) in the lymph nodes and
sometimes other tissues.

The lymphatic or
lymph system is part
of the immune system.
It includes lymph

1 Lymphoma basics » Lymphocytes » Follicular lymphoma

As lymph travels throughout your body, it
passes through hundreds of small beanshaped structures called lymph nodes. Lymph
nodes make immune cells that help the body
fight infection. They also filter the lymph fluid
and remove foreign material such as bacteria
and cancer cells.

There are 3 main types of lymphocytes:




Lymphocytes


Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer
of lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type of
white blood cell that helps fight and prevent
infection. Lymphocytes are found in blood
and lymph tissue, and every organ in the
body. Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels
and lymph nodes. Lymphocytes normally
grow in response to infection or inflammation.
When they grow on their own without proper
regulation, they can develop into lymphoma.

B lymphocytes or B cells make
antibodies. An antibody is a protein that
specifically targets infections or cancer
cells and recruits other parts of the
immune system.
T lymphocytes or T cells help fight
infections, cancer, and control immune
responses.
Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor
cells or virus-infected cells.

Follicular lymphoma starts in mature B cells.

Follicular lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common type
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is a
slow-dividing, slow-growing B-cell lymphoma
that typically forms tumors in lymph nodes.
However, FL can form tumors in other parts

Germinal centers
Follicular lymphoma (FL) starts in
the temporary germinal centers
(GCs) of lymph nodes. These
germinal centers are short-lived
structures that form in response to
infection or inflammation. When B
cells within germinal centers grow
out of control, it can form FL.

of the body such as the bone marrow. This
is called extranodal (outside of the lymph
node) disease. Not everyone with FL needs
treatment right away.

The types of cells found in your FL help
determine the grade, which then determines
the stage. The stage tells if your cancer should
be treated as classic FL, diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, transformed FL, or individualized.

How does FL develop?

Grading
The types of cells found in your FL help
determine the grade. Grades include 1,
2, 3A, and 3B. Grade 3B contains only
centroblasts (large cells), while the other
grades contain mixtures of centrocytes (small
cells) and centroblasts (large cells). The more
centroblasts, the higher the grade. The grade
helps tell how your lymphoma should be
treated.

In lymph nodes, temporary germinal centers
(GCs) form in response to an immune stressor
such as infection or inflammation. This is
normal. But, when cells within germinal centers
grow without proper regulation, it can develop
into FL. In FL, excess amounts of abnormal B
lymphocytes group together to form clusters
(follicles) in the lymph nodes. It might be
helpful to know that these short-lived germinal
centers are different than those found in some
subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Two different organizations categorize FL
based on grade. In the 2022 World Health
Organization classification (WHO5), follicular
lymphoma grades 1, 2, and 3A are termed
classic FL (cFL). International Consensus
classification (ICC) groups grades 1 and 2 as
cFL. This book follows the ICC classification
system.

There are 2 zones in the germinal center: light
and dark.




B cells in the light zone are called
centrocytes. They are smaller, less in
number, and divide less than B cells in the
dark zone.



B cells within the dark zone are
called centroblasts. They are larger
than the cells in the light zone and
reproduce (divide) more.





NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

FL grade 1 and 2 are treated as classic
FL according to the ICC.
Grade 3A might be treated as classic FL
or DLBCL depending on the cancer center
and the types of cells found with testing.
FL grade 3B (FL3B) called follicular large
B cell lymphoma in the WHO5 is rare. It is
treated as DLBCL.

1 Lymphoma basics » Types of FL » Key points

Types of FL

Key points

The following types of FL are described in this
book.



Classic FL


As mentioned on the previous page, classic
FL (cFL) is grade 1 or 2. Almost everyone
with FL has a t(14:18)(q32;q21) chromosome
translocation or has excess levels of the BCL2
protein (BCL2+) in their tumor. A chromosome
translocation is the switching of part of one
chromosome with another chromosome within
the lymphoma cells.





Uncommon FL
When FL has uncommon pathologic (disease)
features or is t(14;18)-negative, it might be
called uncommon FL (uFL). It is treated as
classic FL in this book.



Pediatric-type FL


Pediatric-type FL (PTFL) usually occurs in
children but can also occur in adults. Usually,
only one lymph node is enlarged in the head
and neck region and there might be no
symptoms.

Transformed FL
FL can transform into a more aggressive
lymphoma called diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL). This means your slowgrowing FL has turned into a large-cell, fastgrowing lymphoma. Transformed FL can occur
before, during, or after treatment. In DLBCL,
tumors are commonly found in lymph nodes,
spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other tissues
and organs.

2 Testing for FL » Test results

Accurate testing is essential

Keep these things in mind:

to diagnose and treat follicular



lymphoma (FL). This chapter
presents an overview of possible
tests you might receive and what
to expect.



Follicular lymphoma (FL) might be found
because of swollen lymph nodes or an
enlarged spleen. Swollen lymph nodes can
occur anywhere in the body but are most often
in the neck, armpit, and groin area and in the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis on imaging scans.
FL symptoms can include fever, night sweats,
fatigue, and weight loss. These symptoms are
referred to as B symptoms. Not everyone has
the same symptoms.





Test results
Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and
treat FL. Results from blood tests, bone
marrow aspirate and biopsy, and imaging
studies will be used to guide your treatment
plan. It is important you understand what these
tests mean. Ask questions about your test
results. Online patient portals are one way to
access your test results, but may also contain
communication between members of your
health care team and other information that
might need explaining. Please wait to discuss
all test results with your doctor or health care
team so you have a complete and accurate
understanding of the results.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024



It's beneficial to have a support system
in place during diagnosis and treatment.
Enlist the help of friends, family members,
or peers who can provide transportation,
meals, and emotional support. These can
be different people for different tasks or
change over time.
Consider bringing someone with you to
doctor visits if possible, or have someone
on the phone or join you for telehealth
visits.
Don't hesitate to ask questions and take
notes during appointments. Write down
questions and ask a friend or family
member to take notes. Caregivers should
ask questions, too.
Organize your medical documents,
including insurance forms, medical
records, and test results. Keep a list of
contact information for your care team
and update your primary care physician
(PCP) regarding any changes. Include
details about the specific type of cancer,
treatment, and dates in your contact list.
Set up a MyChart or health record
account if it’s available, which can
help you track your appointments and
communicate with your care team. In
many places the MyChart or portal
messages are not immediately seen by
a nurse or physician, so ask your care
team how best to communicate with them,
especially in an emergency.

For possible tests and procedures, see

medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Some general health tests are described next.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new

2 Testing for FL » Fertility (all genders)

Family history

Fertility (all genders)

Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your care team will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history. Ask family members on both
sides of your family about their health issues
like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes,
and at what age they were diagnosed. It’s
important to know the specific type of cancer
or where the cancer started, if it is in multiple
locations, and if they had genetic testing.

Some types of treatment can affect your
fertility, the ability to have children. If you think
you want children in the future, ask your care
team how cancer and cancer treatment might
change your fertility. To preserve your fertility,
you may need to take action before starting
cancer treatment. Those who want to have
children in the future should be referred to a
fertility specialist to discuss the options before
starting treatment.
Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t sure at the
moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists
can help you sort through what may be best for
your situation.

Physical exam
During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:


Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat





More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app

Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs such as your spleen
and liver are of normal size, are soft or
hard, or cause pain when touched.
Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

2 Testing for FL » Preventing pregnancy during treatment » Performance status

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment

Those with testicles
Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth
control) such as condoms to prevent
pregnancy during and immediately after cancer
treatment.

Cancer and cancer treatment can affect the
ovaries and damage sperm. If you become
pregnant during chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or other types of systemic therapy,
serious birth defects can occur. Speak with
your care team about preventing pregnancy
while being treated for cancer. Hormonal birth
control may or may not be recommended,
so ask your doctor about options such as
intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier
methods. Types of barrier methods include
condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the
contraceptive sponge.

Performance status
Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be
rated using a PS scale called ECOG (Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group). PS is one
factor taken into consideration when choosing
a treatment plan. Your preferences about
treatment are always important.

Those with ovaries
Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing
baby if you are or become pregnant during
treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding at the time of your cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.

The ECOG PS scores are as follows:





Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
period may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended during and after treatment.
Consult your doctor for the best time to plan a
pregnancy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024





PS 0 means the person is fully active.
PS 1 means the person is still able to
perform light to moderate activity, but with
some limitations.
PS 2 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed less than half of the time and
still able to care for self.
PS 3 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed more than half of the time.
PS 4 means the person is totally confined
to the bed or chair and completely
disabled.

Good PS is usually PS 0 or PS 1.

2 Testing for FL » Blood tests

Blood tests

aren’t working as well as they were when
someone had lower levels of creatinine.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein. Be
prepared to have many blood tests during FL
treatment and recovery to check treatment
results, blood counts, and the health of organs
like your liver and kidneys.

Electrolytes
Electrolytes help move nutrients into cells
and help move waste out of cells. Electrolytes
are ions or particles with electrical charges
that help the nerves, muscles, heart, and
brain work as they should. Your body needs
electrolytes such as phosphate (PO4),
potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) to function
properly.

Complete blood count and
differential
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your
blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a picture
of your overall health. A differential counts the
number of each type of WBC (neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and
basophils). It also checks if the counts are in
balance with each other.

Hepatitis B and hepatitis C
Hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV)
are types of liver disease caused by a virus.
A hepatitis blood test will show if you had
hepatitis in the past or if you have it today.
Some cancer treatments can wake up (or
reactivate) the virus. If this happens, it can
cause harm to the liver. There are ways to
prevent or treat reactivation.

Comprehensive metabolic panel

HLA typing

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures different substances in your blood.
It is usually done on the plasma part of your
blood. A CMP provides important information
about how well your kidneys and liver are
working, among other things.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a protein
found on the surface of most cells. It plays
an important role in your body’s immune
response. HLAs are unique to each person.
They mark your body’s cells. Your body
detects these markers to tell which cells are
yours. In other words, all your cells have the
same set of HLAs. Each person’s set of HLAs
is called the HLA type or tissue type.

Creatinine
Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles.
Every person generates a fixed amount of
creatinine every day based on how much
muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the
blood tells how well the kidneys are working.
Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

HLA typing is a blood test that detects a
person’s HLA type. This test is done before
a donor (allogeneic) hematopoietic cell
transplant. To find a donor match, your
proteins will be compared to the donor’s white

14

2 Testing for FL » Blood tests

blood cells to see how many proteins are the
same. A very good match is needed for a
transplant to be a treatment option. Otherwise,
your body will reject the donor cells or the
donor cells will react against your body. Blood
samples from you and your blood relatives will
be tested first.

Testing takes time. It might take
days or weeks for all test results
to come in.

Quantitative immunoglobulins

Pregnancy test

The quantitative immunoglobulin blood test
measures abnormal levels of immunoglobulins,
also known as antibodies, in your blood.
Antibodies are proteins made by the immune
system. An immunoglobulin (Ig) test usually
measures 3 specific types (classes) of
immunoglobulins called IgG, IgM, and IgA.
These immunoglobulins may be abnormally
high due to your lymphoma or abnormally low
due to prior and current lymphoma treatment.

If planned treatment might affect pregnancy,
then those who can become pregnant will
be given a pregnancy test before treatment
begins.

Uric acid
Uric acid is released by cells when DNA
breaks down. It is a normal waste product
that dissolves in your blood and is filtered
by the kidneys where it leaves the body as
urine. Too much uric acid in the body is called
hyperuricemia. High uric acid might be a side
effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Very high levels of uric acid in the blood can
damage the kidneys.

Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)
examines specific proteins in the blood called
globulins, which may be increased in certain
conditions.

Lactate dehydrogenase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is a protein found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into blood. Fastgrowing cells also release LDH.

Liver function tests
Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that are
made or processed by the liver. Levels that
are too high or low signal that the liver is not
working well.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

15

2 Testing for FL » Biopsy

Biopsy



A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue
or fluid for testing. It is an important part of an
accurate diagnosis of lymphoma. Your sample
should be reviewed by a pathologist who is an
expert in the diagnosis of FL. The pathologist
will note the overall appearance and the size,
shape, and type of your cells. This review is
often referred to as histology, histopathology,
or hematopathology review. Tests will be done
on the biopsied cells. Request a copy of the
pathology report. Ask questions about your
biopsy results and what it means for your
treatment.

Lymph node biopsy
A lymph node biopsy is recommended to
diagnose FL. Lymph nodes can be too small to
be seen or felt. Sometimes, lymph nodes can
feel swollen, enlarged, hard to the touch, or
don’t move when pushed (fixed or immobile).
A lymph node biopsy can be done using a
needle biopsy procedure or as a small surgery
to remove (excise) a lymph node.

A biopsy is usually done with other lab
methods to accurately diagnose FL. These
other lab methods include:


Immunohistochemistry (IHC)



Flow cytometry (FCM)

Bone marrow aspirate
and biopsy
Samples of bone and marrow
are removed in a biopsy

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

FL genetic testing to detect chromosome
translocations or mutations, which may
include karyotype, fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH), or sequencing
studies.

16

2 Testing for FL » Immunophenotyping

Immunophenotyping

A lymph node biopsy can be done in the
following ways:






Immunophenotyping is a process that uses
antibodies to detect the presence or absence
of certain antigens. Antigens are proteins or
markers that can be found on the surface of
or inside all cells, including white blood cells.
Specific groupings of antigens are normal.
However, some specific patterns of antigens
called the immunophenotype help define all
normal blood cells and classify non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) and FL.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and
core biopsy (CB) use needles of
different sizes to remove a sample of
tissue or fluid.
Incisional biopsy removes a small
amount of tissue through a cut in the skin
or body.
Excisional biopsy removes the entire
tumor through a cut in the skin or body.

Immunophenotyping can be done using
specialized techniques called flow cytometry
or immunohistochemistry. These techniques
are used to distinguish FL from other types
of lymphoma such as diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL). Immunophenotype
can change as cancer progresses. FL
immunophenotype is usually CD10+, BCL2+,
CD23+/-, CD43-, CD5-, CD20+, and BCL6+.
Rare cases of FL may be CD10- or BCL2-. For
more information on tests to diagnose FL, see

A core or excisional biopsy are preferred.

Bone marrow tests
Bone marrow tests might be done depending
on your situation. There are 2 types of bone
marrow tests that are often done at the same
time:


Bone marrow aspirate



Bone marrow biopsy

Guide 2.

Flow cytometry

Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding
liquid and cells. An aspirate takes some of the
liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy
takes a piece of the sponge.

Flow cytometry (FCM) is a laboratory method
used to detect, identify, and count specific
cells. Flow cytometry involves adding a
light-sensitive dye to cells. The dyed cells
are passed through a beam of light in a
machine. The machine measures the number
of cells, things like the size and shape of
the cells, and other unique features of cells.
Flow cytometry may be used on cells from
circulating (peripheral) blood, bone marrow,
or a biopsy. The most common use of flow
cytometry is in the identification of markers on
cells, particularly in the immune system (called
immunophenotyping).

Your care team will try to make you as
comfortable as possible for this procedure. The
samples are usually taken from the back of
the hip bone (pelvis). You will likely lie on your
belly or side. For an aspirate, a hollow needle
will be pushed through your skin and into the
bone. Liquid bone marrow will then be drawn
into a syringe. For the biopsy, a wider needle
will be used to remove a small piece of your
bone. You may feel bone pain at your hip for a
few days. Your skin may bruise.

CD19, CD20, CD5, CD23, and CD10.

testing looks for changes only in the FL
cells that have developed over time, and not
changes in the rest of your body’s cells.

Immunohistochemistry

Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of
46 chromosomes. Each chromosome contains
thousands of genes. Genes are coded
instructions for the proteins your cells make.
A mutation is when something goes wrong
in the genetic code. Proteins are written like
this: BCL6. Genes are written with italics like
this: BCL6. When a gene or protein is found
(expressed), it is shown with a plus sign (+)
like this: CD10+. When a gene or protein has
not been found, it is written with a negative
sign (-) like this CD10-.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to immune cells. The cells are
then studied using a microscope. IHC looks for
the immunophenotype of cells from a biopsy or
tissue sample.

Testing for FL biomarker
and genetic changes
Biomarker and genetic tests are used to
learn more about your type of FL, to guide
treatment, and to determine the likely path
your cancer will take (prognosis). This genetic
testing is different from family history genetic
testing or genetic cancer risk testing. This

FL cells sometimes have changes in genes
and chromosomes that can be seen under a
microscope or found with other tests.

over time. Mutations can also happen during
treatment. Mutation testing is used to look for
these new mutations. Some mutations lead to
resistance to certain targeted therapies. There
are many possible mutations.

Examples of proteins on the cells:


BCL2, BCL6, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD20,
IRF4/MUM1, Ki-67, and others

FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. Since
this test doesn’t need growing cells, it can be
performed on bone marrow, lymph node, or
blood sample.

Examples of genes in the DNA of cells:


BCL6, IRF4/MUM1, EZH2, and others

Beta-2-microglobulin tumor marker
test
Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) is a protein
that can be found in the blood, urine, or
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). B2M is a type of
tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances
made by cancer cells or by normal cells in
response to cancer in the body.

FISH can find translocations that are too small
to be seen with other methods. A translocation
occurs when parts of two chromosomes switch
with one another. However, FISH can only
be used for known changes. It cannot detect
all the possible changes found within the
chromosomes or genes.

FL mutation testing

Karyotype

A sample of your lymph node, blood, or
bone marrow will be used to see if the FL
cancer cells have any specific mutations.
Some mutations can be targeted with specific
therapies. This is separate from the genetic
testing for mutations that you may have
inherited from your biological parents.

A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes.
Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
A karyotype will show extra, missing
(deletion), rearranged, or abnormal pieces
of chromosomes within the lymphoma cells.
Since a karyotype requires growing cells, a
sample of bone marrow or blood must be
used.

FL cells can have changes in genes and
chromosomes. Mutation testing using
methods such as karyotype, fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), and next-generation
sequencing (NGS) are used to look for these
changes or abnormalities. Some mutations
may determine the type of treatment given.
Subtle new drug-resistant mutations may occur
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

Translocations
Translocation is a switching of parts between
two chromosomes. A translocation between
chromosome 14 and 18 is written as t(14;18).
Specific translocations can help distinguish
between types of blood cancers and disorders.

2 Testing for FL » Testing for FL biomarker and genetic changes

Gene rearrangements
Normal B cells and T cells break their DNA
in certain ways to create diversity within your
immune system. In a tumor, all cancer cells
derive from the same original cell. In FL that
cell is a B cell. When that one B cell divides
many times, the entire group of B cells is
called clonal or the tumor is described as
having clonality. In clonal cells, the same gene
rearrangement are found in a group of cancer
cells. Pathologists have tests they can use to
determine if a group of cells are clonal or not.

FL genetic changes
FL cells can have changes in genes
and chromosomes. Mutation testing
looks for these changes or abnormalities
that are unique to FL cells. Examples
of such changes are called deletion,
insertion, amplification, translocation
(rearrangement), and point mutation. Most
follicular lymphomas will test positive for
t(14;18) or BCL2.

PCR

3 Amplification – When part or

a whole chromosome or gene is
increased (for example, duplicated)

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions
of copies of your DNA or RNA (genetic
information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find
1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000
normal cells. These copies, called PCR
product, might be used for next-generation
sequencing (NGS). This is important when
testing for treatment response or remission.

3 Deletion – When part of a

chromosome or gene is missing

3 Insertion – When a new part of a
chromosome or gene is included

3 Inversion – Switching of parts within
one chromosome

3 Point mutation – When part of a

Next-generation sequencing

gene is changed

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a
method used to determine a portion of a
person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene
has any mutations that might affect how the
gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more
detailed way than other methods and can find
mutations that other methods might miss.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

3 Chromosome translocation and

gene rearrangement – Switching
of parts between 2 chromosomes.
When described at the chromosome
level, it is called a translocation. When
described at the gene level, it is called
rearrangement. For example, the
chromosome translocation is written
as t(14;18)(q32;q21) and its gene
rearrangement is written as IGH::BCL2.

2 Testing for FL » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

MRI scan
An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body to look for cancer deposits. A
radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will interpret the test and send a report
to your doctor. While these reports might be
available to you through your patient portal or
patient access system, please wait to discuss
these results with your doctor.

Contrast material

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

Contrast material is used to improve the
quality of the pictures of the inside of the
body. Contrast materials are not dyes, but
substances that help enhance and improve
the images of several organs and structures
in the body. It is used to make the pictures
clearer. The contrast is not permanent and will
leave your body in your urine immediately after
the test. The types of contrast vary and are
different for CT and MRI.

MRI is most commonly used to evaluate the
brain and the spinal cord.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

PET scan
A PET (positron emission tomography) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer
is a substance injected into a vein to see
where cancer cells are in the body and how
much sugar is being taken up by the cancer
cells. This gives an idea about how fast the
cancer cells are growing. Cancer cells show
up as bright spots on PET scans. However, not
all tumors will appear on a PET scan. Also, not
all bright spots are cancer. It is normal for the
brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright
on PET. Inflammation or infection can also
show up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

CT scan
A CT or CAT (computed tomography) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your chest,
abdomen, and pelvis may be one of the tests
to look for cancer. In most cases, contrast will
be used.

type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

A multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan
is another way to evaluate the pumping
function of your heart. It uses a small
amount of radiotracer injected into a vein
and a special camera creates computergenerated movie images of your beating
heart.

3 Choose a binder that meets your

needs. Consider a zipper pocket to
include a pen, small calendar, and
insurance cards.

Treatment overview

Psychologists and psychiatrists
are mental health experts who can help
manage issues such as depression,
anxiety, or other mental health conditions
that can affect how you think and feel.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is highly treatable
and may be curable in certain circumstances.
Often, treatment for FL can wait until you have
symptoms. However, most people with FL do
not have symptoms when starting treatment.
This is because you might not have symptoms
even though the cancer in your lymph nodes
has grown or progressed (called progressive
lymphadenopathy).

Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional issues. The anxiety a
person feels when diagnosed with cancer
might be managed by a social worker
in some cancer centers. They, or other
designated professionals, can help
navigate the complexities of financial and
insurance stresses.

Treatment for FL usually consists of systemic
therapy and sometimes radiation therapy.
Systemic therapy is drug therapy that works
throughout the body. Some types include
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and
immunotherapy. The choice of therapy takes
into consideration many factors, including
age, other serious health issues, and future
treatment possibilities like a hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT) or cellular therapy. Your
preferences about treatment are important.
If you have any religious or personal beliefs
about certain kinds of treatment, now would
be the time to share them with your care team.
It is important to have regular talks with your
care team about your goals for treatment and
your treatment plan.

Spiritual care specialists identify and
support those with spiritual distress or
unmet spiritual needs.
A research team helps to collect
research data and coordinate care if
you are in a clinical trial. Clinical trials
help bring new therapies to patients and
advance the treatment for everyone.
Consider asking your care team about
access to clinical trials.

International Prognostic Index
The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is a
scoring system for prognosis in those with
lymphoma. A prognosis is the likely course
your disease will take. A follicular lymphoma
IPI (FLIPI-1) is based on age, Ann Arbor
cancer stage, hemoglobin (Hgb) and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) results, and the number
of lymph node sites with cancer.

The goal of treatment is remission. There are
different types of treatment response. When
there are no signs of cancer on imaging and
a bone marrow biopsy, it is called a complete
response (CR) or complete remission.
Remission can be short-term (temporary) or
long-lasting (permanent). In partial response
(PR), cancer is still present, but it has reduced
in size. Follicular lymphoma can go through
long periods of remission followed by relapse.
FL can also regress or get smaller on its own
without treatment. This is not completely
understood but it is common for the size of
your FL to fluctuate in size.

Cancer 3 centimeters (cm) or larger in 3
or more lymph node areas
A tumor mass 7 cm or larger (bulky
disease) found anywhere in the body

3 Treating FL » Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy

Relapse
FL might relapse more than once. When
FL returns after a period of remission, it is
called a relapse. The goal of treatment is to
achieve remission again. But, depending on
the pace of tumor growth and the location and
size of the tumor, you may or may not need
immediate treatment. A relapse may or may
not be serious. It is important to ask about your
prognosis.

Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. More than one
chemotherapy may be used to treat FL. When
only one drug is used, it’s called a single
agent. A combination or multi-agent regimen is
the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs.
Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that
are infused into a vein or injected under the
skin with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs
may be given as a pill that is swallowed. The
final dose differs between people because it is
based on body weight and height. Intrathecal
chemotherapy is injected into spinal or brain
fluid.

Refractory
When FL remains and does not respond to
treatment, it is called refractory or resistant
cancer. This cancer may be resistant at the
start of treatment or it may become resistant
during treatment. Refractory disease is very
serious. It is important to ask about your
prognosis.

In most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles
of treatment days followed by days of rest.
This allows the body to recover before the
next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending
on which chemotherapy is used. You will have
tests to see how the cancer is responding to
treatment. You might spend time in the hospital
during treatment.

Surveillance and monitoring
You will be monitored throughout treatment.
Surveillance watches for any changes in
your condition. You will have tests during
surveillance to check for relapse. You
might hear it called active surveillance or
observation.

Observation without treatment
Some slow-growing (indolent) lymphomas do
not require immediate treatment, including
FL. Observation is sometimes called active
surveillance or watch and wait. During
observation, your care team will monitor for
changes in your health or signs that your
lymphoma has grown or progressed.

3 Treating FL » Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy

A biosimilar or substitute might
be used in place of rituximab. A
biosimilar is an almost identical
version of a drug made by another
company. It is used in the exact
same way and at the same dose as
rituximab. Biosimilars for rituximab
include: Riabni, Hycela, Ruxience,
and Truxima.

Immunotherapy is drug therapy that
increases the activity of your immune
system. By doing so, it improves your body’s
ability to find and destroy cancer cells.
Immunotherapy can be given alone or with
other types of treatment.

Antibody therapy
Antibody therapy uses antibodies to
help the body fight cancer, infection, or
other diseases. Antibodies are proteins
made by the immune system that bind
to specific markers on cells or tissues.
A monoclonal antibody is made from a
unique white blood cell, such as B or T cell.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in cancer
treatment may kill cancer cells directly, block
development of tumor blood vessels, or help
the immune system kill cancer cells. As with
other treatments, there is the potential for
complications.

Bispecific antibody therapy
Bispecific antibodies (BsABs) bind to 2
different proteins (CD20 and CD3 antigen) at
the same time. It treats cancer by engaging
and activating T cells, and redirecting them
to the site of the lymphoma. Bispecific
examples include epcoritamab-bysp (Epkinly),
mosunetuzumab-axgb (Lunsumio), and
glofitamab-gxbm (Columvi).

CD20-targeting monoclonal antibody
therapy
CD20-targeting mAbs (also called anti-CD20
mAbs) such as rituximab (Rituxan) and
obinutuzumab (Gazyva) work against the
protein CD20 found on the surface of B cells.
The drug binds to the CD20 protein causing
cell death.

Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

CD19-targeting monoclonal antibody
therapy
Tafasitamab-cxix (Monjuvi) is used to
treat transformed FL or high-grade B-cell
lymphomas by targeting the CD19 protein.

29

3 Treating FL » Chemoimmunotherapy » Targeted therapy » Other systemic therapies

Chemoimmunotherapy

Targeted therapy

Chemoimmunotherapy, also called
immunochemotherapy, includes chemotherapy
and immunotherapy drugs to treat cancer.

Targeted therapy is drug therapy that focuses
on specific or unique features of cancer cells.
Targeted therapies seek out how cancer cells
grow, divide, and move in the body. These
drugs stop or inhibit the action of molecules
that help cancer cells grow and/or survive.

CD19-targeting CAR T-cell therapy
CAR T-cell therapy is made by removing T
cells from your body and then training your
own immune cells to fight the lymphoma
for you by adding a CAR (chimeric antigen
receptor) to the T cells. This genetically
modifies and programs the T cells to find
cancer cells. The programmed T cells will be
infused back into your body after a brief course
of chemotherapy (called lymphodepleting
chemotherapy) to find and kill cancer cells.
This treatment is not for everyone. There can
be severe and sometimes life-threatening
reactions to this treatment.

Other systemic therapies
Antibody drug conjugate
An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) delivers
cell-specific chemotherapy. It attaches to a
protein found on the outside of the cancer cell
and then enters the cell. Once inside the cell,
chemotherapy is released. Loncastuximab
tesirine-lpyl (Zynlonta) is an ADC that targets
the CD19 protein. Polatuzumab vedotin-piiq
targets the CD79b protein. An ADC might be
used for transformed FL.

CAR T-cell therapy is one way to target CD19.
CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy options for
FL include axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta),
lisocabtagene maraleucel (Breyanzi),and
tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah).

Enzyme inhibitor
A methyltransferase inhibitor blocks enzymes
involved in gene expression and cell division.
Tazemetostat (Tazverik) is a methyltransferase
inhibitor that might be used for relapsed or
refractory disease.

More information on CAR T-cell therapy can be
found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Immune modulator
An immunomodulator changes your immune
system so it can work more effectively
especially when combined with monoclonal
antibodies. Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is an
example of an immune modulator that is used
commonly with rituximab, obinutuzumab or
tafasitamab.

3 Treating FL » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

External beam radiation
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s) or areas of the body.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from photons, electrons, or protons,
and other sources to kill cancer cells and
shrink tumors. RT may be used as the main
treatment to cure cancer (curative treatment),
or as supportive care or palliative care to help
ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer.

Common types of EBRT that may be used to
treat your cancer include the following:


Radiation is typically delivered from outside
the body by a computerized device, which
can shape the treatment to closely fit the
location and size of the tumor. Treatment is
given in small daily doses, on workdays, with
weekends off.



You will see your radiation oncologist at least
weekly to review your progress and to help
with side effects, such as sunburn-like rash.
Ask your care team which radiation option(s)
are best for your situation, if RT will be
combined with chemotherapy, and what side
effects to expect. RT puts you at a small risk of
developing another cancer in the future.



Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape of
the tumor.
Involved-site radiation therapy
(ISRT) treats the cancer site or cancer
found in or near lymph nodes (nodal
disease).

Total body irradiation
Total body irradiation (TBI) is radiation of the
whole body given before hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT).

A four-dimensional (4D) CT scan might be
used to plan RT. A 4D-CT records multiple
images over time. It allows playback of the
scan as a video, so that internal movement
can be tracked and observed.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses
computer software and CT images to aim
beams that match the shape of the tumor.

31

3 Treating FL » Hematopoietic cell transplant

Hematopoietic cell
transplant

Allogeneic transplant
An allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(allogeneic HCT) uses healthy stem cells from
a donor. The donor may or may not be related
to you. Before an HCT, treatment is needed
to destroy bone marrow cells. This is called
conditioning and it creates room for the healthy
donor stem cells. It also weakens the immune
system so your body won’t kill the transplanted
cells. Chemotherapy is used for conditioning.
Radiation therapy may also be given as part of
conditioning treatment.

A hematopoietic stem cell is an immature cell
that can develop into any type of blood cell. A
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) replaces
hematopoietic stem cells that have been
destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/
or radiation therapy as part of the transplant
process. You might hear it called a stem cell
transplant (SCT) or a bone marrow transplant
(BMT). This book will refer to it as HCT. HCTs
are performed in specialized centers.

After conditioning, you will receive a
transfusion of the healthy stem cells from a
donor matched to you. A transfusion is a slow
injection of blood products into a vein. This
can take several hours. The transplanted
stem cells will travel to your bone marrow
and grow. New, healthy blood cells will form.
This is called engraftment. It usually takes
about 2 to 4 weeks. Until then, you will have
little or no immune defense. You may need to
stay in a very clean room at the hospital or be
given antibiotics to prevent or treat infection.
Transfusions are also possible. A red blood cell
transfusion is used to prevent bleeding and
to treat anemia (below normal red blood cell
count). A platelet transfusion is used to treat
a low platelet count or bleeding. While waiting
for the cells to engraft, you will likely feel tired
and weak. This treatment has very serious and
life-threatening side effects.

There are 2 types of HCTs:



Autologous – stem cells come from you.
Allogeneic – stem cells come from a
donor who may or may not be related to
you.

HCTs are only given in very specific cases for
follicular lymphoma. Ask your care team why.

Autologous transplant
An autologous transplant is also called HDT/
ASCR (high-dose therapy with autologous
stem cell rescue) or an autologous HCT. First,
your healthy stem cells will be removed. Then,
you will receive highly intensified treatment to
kill remaining lymphoma cells and your bone
marrow cells. Your healthy stem cells will be
returned to rescue your marrow that produces
and replenishes our blood and immune cells.

Possible side effects
Every treatment has side effects. You will be
monitored for infections, disease relapse, and
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In GVHD,
the donor cells attack your normal, healthy
tissue. There are treatments for GVHD. Ask
your care team about the possible side effects
or complications of HCT and how this might
affect your quality of life.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

More information on GVHD can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:


Turmeric



Ginkgo biloba



Green tea extract



St. John’s Wort



Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the
ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids,
heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care
medicines given during systemic therapy.
Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.
Bring a list with you to every visit.

3 Treating FL » Clinical trials

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Finding a clinical trial

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

3 Treating FL » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, lab
tests, or general health. These requirements
ensure that participants are alike in specific
ways and that the trial is as safe as possible
for the participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
It depends on the study, your health insurance,
and the state in which you live. In general,
procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered
standard of care will be billed to you or
your insurance, whereas those considered
research are covered by the trial sponsor. Your
treatment team and the research team can
help determine if you are responsible for any
costs.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

3 Treating FL » General supportive care

General supportive care

All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called
side effects. It is important to
tell your care team about all of
your side effects so they can be
managed.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Supportive care might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you are
feeling and about any side effects so they can
be managed. Supportive care, best supportive
care, and palliative care often mean the same
thing.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors
include the drug type and dose, length of
treatment, the person and what other illnesses
they may have, and medicines they may be
taking. Some side effects may be harmful to
your health. Others may just be unpleasant.
Treatment can cause several side effects.
Some are very serious.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

people, and medicines that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Some possible side effects are described next.
They are not listed in order of importance and
some side effects are very rare.

Fatigue
Fatigue is a state of physical or mental
tiredness that can be characterized by a lack
of energy, motivation, or stamina. Fatigue
may be caused by cancer or it may be a side
effect of treatment. Let your care team know
how you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in
the way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating
a balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Blood clots
Cancer can cause blood clots to form. This
can block blood flow and oxygen in the body.
Blood clots can break loose and travel to other
parts of the body causing breathing problems,
stroke, or other problems.

Cytokine release syndrome
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a
condition that may occur after treatment
with some types of immunotherapy, such
as monoclonal antibodies and CAR T cells.
It is caused by a large, rapid release of
cytokines from immune cells affected by the
immunotherapy. Signs and symptoms of
CRS include fever, muscle aches, nausea,
headache, rash, fast heartbeat, low blood
pressure, and trouble breathing.

Hair loss
Chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia)
all over your body—not just on your scalp.
Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely
than others to cause hair loss. Dosage might
also affect the amount of hair loss. Most of
the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is
temporary. Hair often regrows 3 to 6 months
after treatment ends. Your hair may be a
different shade or texture.

Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how to
manage diarrhea. It is important to drink lots of
fluids.

Hand-foot syndrome
Hand-foot syndrome is a common side
effect of chemotherapy. Small amounts of
chemotherapy leak out of very small blood
vessels called capillaries in the palms of the
hands and soles of the feet. It causes redness,
swelling, and pain. Sometimes blisters appear.
You will want to protect your hands and feet by
applying moisturizer or lotion.

Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

3 Treating FL » Side effects

Hypersensitivity, allergy, and
anaphylaxis
Hypersensitivity is an exaggerated
response by the immune system to a
drug or other substance. This can include
hives, skin welts, and trouble breathing.
An allergy is an immune reaction to a
substance that normally is harmless or
would not cause an immune response in
most people. An allergic response may
cause harmful symptoms such as itching
or inflammation (swelling). Anaphylaxis
or anaphylactic shock is a severe and
possible life-threatening allergic reaction.

Supportive care resources
More information on supportive care is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer
app.

Infections
Infections occur more frequently and are
more severe in those with a weakened
immune system. Drug treatment for FL
can weaken the body’s natural defense
against infections. If not treated early,
infections can be fatal.
Neutropenia, a low number of white blood
cells, can lead to frequent or severe infections.
When someone with neutropenia also
develops a fever, it is called febrile neutropenia
(FN). With FN, your risk of infection may be
higher than normal. This is because a low
number of white blood cells leads to a reduced
ability to fight infections. FN is a side effect of
some types of systemic therapy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Follicular Lymphoma, 2024

Loss of appetite
Sometimes side effects from cancer or its
treatment, and the stress of having cancer
might cause you to feel not hungry or sick to
your stomach (nauseated). You might have a
sore mouth or difficulty swallowing. Healthy
eating is important during treatment. It includes
eating a balanced diet, eating the right
amount of food, and drinking enough fluids. A
registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition
and food can help. Speak to your care team if
you have trouble eating or maintaining weight.

3 Treating FL » Side effects

Low blood cell counts

Neurocognitive or
neuropsychological effects

Some cancer treatments can cause low blood
cell counts.






Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems
with concentration and memory. Survivors
are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be
recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of
your brain affects your thinking and behavior.
Neuropsychological testing can identify your
limits and doctors can create a plan to help
with these limits.

Anemia is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to
your cells. You might tire easily if you are
anemic.
Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infection.
Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Neuropathy
Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment such as
chemotherapy. Most of the time, neuropathy
goes away after treatment.

Lymphedema
Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph
fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.
It may be caused when part of the lymph
system is damaged or blocked, such as
during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment, or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression devices, and
other means.

Neurotoxicity
Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems
with concentration and memory. Seizures
and confusion can occur. If treatment
includes methotrexate (MTX), then you will
be monitored for methotrexate neurotoxicity.
Neurotoxicity, such as seizures and confusion,
can be seen with immunotherapy, as well.

Nausea and vomiting

Organ issues

Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

Treatment might cause your kidneys, liver,
heart, and pancreas to not work as well as
they should.

3 Treating FL » Side effects

Pain

Tumor lysis syndrome

Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain.

Cancer treatment causes cell death. In tumor
lysis syndrome (TLS), waste released by
dead cells builds up in the body causing
kidney damage and severe blood electrolyte
disturbances. Changes in creatinine, lactic
acid, uric acid, phosphorus (Phos), potassium
(K), and calcium (Ca) levels can be a sign of
TLS. TLS can be life-threatening.

Quality of life
Cancer and its treatment can affect your
overall well-being or quality of life (QOL). For
more information on quality of life, see NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Palliative Care at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Weight gain
Weight gain is one side effect of high-dose
steroids. This can be uncomfortable and cause
distress. It is important to maintain muscle
mass. Find a physical activity you enjoy. Ask
your care team what can be done to help
manage weight gain.

Therapy-related toxicity
Many of the drug therapies used to treat
follicular lymphoma can be harmful to the
body. You will be closely monitored for therapyrelated toxicity.

Seek out support groups at
your local hospital, through
social media, or from those
listed in the back of this book.
Look to friends, relatives,
neighbors, and coworkers for
social support.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is highly
treatable and may be curable in certain
circumstances. Often, treatment for
FL can wait until you have symptoms.
However, most people with FL do not
have symptoms when starting treatment.

You know your body
better than anyone

Treatment for FL usually consists of
systemic therapy. Radiation therapy
might be given. The goal of treatment is
to achieve a complete response (CR) or
remission.

Help your care team understand:

3 How you feel
3 What you need
3 What is working and what is not

Systemic therapy works throughout the
body. It includes chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and immunotherapy.

Keep a list of names and contact
information for each member of your
team. This will make it easier for you
and anyone involved in your care to
know whom to contact with questions
or concerns.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses highenergy radiation from photons, protons,
electrons, and other sources to kill cancer
cells and shrink tumors.
A clinical trial is a type of research that
studies a treatment to see how safe it is
and how well it works.

Get to know your care team
and help them get to know
you.

Supportive care is health care that
relieves symptoms caused by cancer or
its treatment and improves quality of life.
Supportive care is always given.
All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important for you to tell your
care team about all your side effects so
they can be managed.

lymphoma (cFL) is based on
cancer stage. Often, treatment can
wait until you have symptoms.



Together, you and your care team
will choose a treatment plan that
is best for you.


Stage 2 bulky – Bulky disease means
there are areas of lymphoma that
measure 7.5 centimeters (cm) or larger.
Bulky disease can be limited or advanced.
Stage 3 (advanced) – Disease found
in lymph nodes above and below the
diaphragm on the same side of the body
or disease found in nodes above the
diaphragm and in the spleen.
Stage 4 (advanced) – Disease has
spread outside of the lymphatic system to
other parts of the body.

Cancer staging
Lymph node regions

Cancer staging is used to reflect prognosis
and help guide treatment decisions. Prognosis
is the likely course your cancer will take. In
follicular lymphoma (FL), your age, the number
and location of lymph nodes affected by
cancer, blood test results, and other factors
play a role in prognosis. In addition, treatment
decisions will be based on histology and
results of FL biomarker and genetic tests.
Histology is the overall appearance and the
size, shape, and type of your cells.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) forms in and
is mostly limited to the lymph nodes.
However, FL can be found outside of the
lymph nodes in areas such as the bone
marrow or blood.
Treatment options include radiation
therapy, systemic (drug) therapy, or a
clinical trial. The goal of treatment is
remission.
Since FL is often a slow-growing disease,
your care team might wait until symptoms
appear before starting treatment. This is
called observation, active surveillance, or
watch and wait. However, most people
with FL do not have symptoms when
starting treatment.
FL often goes through periods of
remission and relapse. When FL relapses
or progresses, a different systemic
therapy will be given.

means your slow-growing FL
has turned into a large-cell, fastgrowing lymphoma. Together, you
and your care team will choose a
treatment plan that is best for you.

Overview

After little or no therapy

Follicular lymphoma (FL) can transform into
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This
can occur before, during, or after treatment.
In DLBCL, large-cell, fast-dividing tumors are
commonly found in lymph nodes, spleen, liver,
bone marrow, or other tissues and organs. The
risk of transformation is very low. However,
transformed FL is very serious.

If FL changed into DLBCL after little or
no treatment, then it will be treated with a
chemoimmunotherapy such as RCHOP or
Pola-R-CHP. Radiation therapy might be given.
Involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT) treats
cancer found in a small region or one area of
your body. The goal of treatment is remission.

Certain gene rearrangements can be found
in DLBCL. In gene rearrangements, part of a
gene has broken off and attached to another
gene.








MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 gene
rearrangements are commonly found in
DLBCL.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) will be done to look for gene
rearrangements.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

RCHOP consists of rituximab,
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,

Standard of care is the best-known
way to treat a particular disease based
on past clinical trials. There may be
more than one treatment regimen that
is considered standard of care. Ask
your care team what treatment options
are available and if a clinical trial might
be right for you.

Observation or a clinical trial are options.
If disease relapses, you will have a biopsy
before treatment.
If a partial response (PR), then you will be
given a different chemoimmunotherapy.

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors

records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.
