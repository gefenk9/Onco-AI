About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Cervical Cancer, Version 1.2024 – September 20, 2023.

The cervix

Cervical cancer is a common
cancer of the female reproductive

The cervix is the narrow, lower end of the
uterus. The uterus is where a baby grows and
develops before being born. During birth, the
cervix opens (dilates) and thins (effaces) to
allow the baby to move into the vagina. The
vagina, or birth canal, is the muscular passage
through which babies are born.

system. Most cervical cancers
are caused by long-term infection
with human papillomavirus (HPV).
HPV is the most common sexually
transmitted infection. The use of

An ovary and a fallopian tube are on each side
of the upper uterus. The fallopian tubes connect
to the top part of the uterus. The ovaries make
eggs for sexual reproduction. They also make
hormones that affect breast growth, body
shape, and the menstrual cycle. Eggs pass out
of the ovary and travel through the attached
fallopian tube into the uterus. The cervix, uterus,
vagina, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are part of
the female reproductive system.

Pap smears has resulted in much
lower rates of cervical cancer in
the United States.

The female reproductive
system
The reproductive system is
a group of organs that work
together for the purpose of
sexual reproduction. In addition
to the uterus (and cervix), this
system includes the ovaries,
fallopian tubes, and vagina.

Cervical cancer basics » The cervix

serves as an opening between the uterus and
the cervix.

Most cervical cancers start in the thin layer of
tissue that lines the outer part and inner parts
of the cervix.

The area where the endocervix and ectocervix
meet is called the squamo-columnar junction
or the transformation zone. Most cervical
cancers and pre-cancers start in the ectocervix
portion of the transformation zone.

The ectocervix is the outer part of the cervix.
It appears rounded and extends into the
vagina. The ectocervix can be seen during an
examination of the vagina and cervix using
a tool called a speculum. It is lined with cells
called squamous cells. In the center of the
ectocervix is a narrow opening called the
external os. During menstruation, the external
os opens slightly to allow blood to pass into
the vagina.

The cervical stroma is the thick layer of
muscular tissue beneath the cervical lining.
The parametrium is the fat and connective
tissue that surrounds the uterus (and cervix)
and connects it to the pelvis.
Although the cervix is part of the uterus,
uterine cancer is diagnosed and treated
differently than cervical cancer. This patient
guide does not discuss treatment of uterine
cancers, such as endometrial cancer and
uterine sarcomas.

The endocervix (endocervical canal) is the
inner part of the cervix that forms a canal
between the vagina and the body of the
uterus. The endocervix is lined with columnar
(glandular) cells that make mucus. The inner
os is the upper part of the endocervix that

The cervix
Most cervical cancers start in
the area where the inner and
outer cervix meet, called the
squamo-columnar junction.
Specifically, most form in
squamous cells that line the
ectocervix part of the squamocolumnar junction.

cells invade the muscular tissue beneath the
cervical lining (the cervical stroma).

Cervical cancer starts as areas of abnormal,
microscopic cells on the surface of the
cervix. These changes are known as cervical
dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
(CIN). Mutations (changes) in the DNA of
these cells cause them to become abnormal. If
left untreated, cervical dysplasia may become
cervical cancer.

An area of dysplasia or cancer is also
referred to as a lesion. Low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) refers to mild
dysplasia (CIN 1). High-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) refers to moderate
or severe dysplasia (CIN 2 and 3). HSIL is
considered a pre-cancer.

CIN is graded based on the depth of the
abnormal cells on the lining of the cervix.
The possible grades are 1, 2, or 3. Cervical
dysplasia becomes cancer when the abnormal

Cervical changes
Cervical dysplasia refers to areas of abnormal cells on the lining of the cervix. Lowgrade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) refers to mild dysplasia (CIN 1). High-grade

Cervical cancer basics » Risk factors

Risk factors

There are two other HPV vaccines available in
other parts of the world. One protects against
HPV-16 and HPV-18 only. The other targets
these and two additional types.

A risk factor is something that increases the
risk of developing a disease. Some people with
no known risk factors may develop cervical
cancer, while others with risk factors may not.

The vaccine works best in younger people
(ideally under age 13) because they are less
likely to have been exposed to HPV. And, while
the vaccine can prevent new HPV infections, it
does not treat existing HPV infections or HPVrelated cancer.

HPV infection
Almost all cervical cancers are caused by
long-term infection with human papillomavirus
(HPV). HPV is an extremely common sexually
transmitted infection (STI). Most sexually
active people have or had HPV at one point.
Most are unaware that they are or were
infected.

Other risk factors
Other risk factors for cervical cancer are listed
below. Some of these lead to a higher risk
because they either increase the risk of being
exposed to HPV or they weaken the immune
system, which can make it harder for the body
to clear HPV infection.

In most people, the immune system gets rid of
(“clears”) HPV from the body. In other people,
the virus causes long-term cell changes that
develop into cancer. The progression to cancer
often occurs decades after the initial infection.



Experts are still learning why one person gets
cervical cancer and another does not. Other
types of cancer caused by HPV include anal,
head and neck, penile, vaginal, and vulvar
cancers.



There are more than 100 types (strains) of
HPV. Infection with some strains is more likely
to lead to cancer. High-risk forms include HPV16 and HPV-18. Other HPV types can cause
abnormal skin growths, called warts, to form
on the anus, genitals, or other areas of the
body.

Types of cervical cancer

Key points

Most cervical cancers start in the ectocervix.
The ectocervix is lined with squamous cells.
Cancer that forms in squamous cells is called
a squamous cell carcinoma.

The cervix




About 2 out of 10 cervical cancers form in the
endocervical canal. The endocervix is lined
with cells that make mucus. These cells are
referred to as glandular, gland-like, secretory,
or columnar cells. Cancers that form in
glandular cells are called adenocarcinomas.



Less commonly, the cancer may contain both
squamous and adenocarcinoma cells. These
cancers are referred to as adenosquamous
carcinomas. They are sometimes called
“mixed” tumors.

The cervix is the lower part of the uterus
that connects to the vagina.
The ectocervix is the outer part that
extends into the vagina. The endocervix
is the canal between the vagina and the
body of the uterus.
Most cervical cancers and pre-cancers
start in the ectocervix portion of the
transformation zone.

Cervical changes


Treatment for squamous cell carcinoma,
adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous
carcinoma is the focus of Part 4.



The rarest and most aggressive type of
cervical cancer is neuroendocrine carcinoma
of the cervix (NECC). Treatment for small cell
NECC is the focus of Part 5.

Cervical cancer starts as areas of
abnormal, microscopic cells on the
surface of the cervix.
These changes are known as cervical
dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN).

Risk factors


This patient guide does not discuss other
types of cervical cancer such as glassy-cell
carcinomas, sarcomas, or other tumor types.



The risk factor most strongly linked with
cervical cancer is long-term infection with
HPV, a common sexually transmitted
infection.
A vaccine that protects against 9 different
strains of HPV, including the highest-risk
strains, is available in the United States.

testing and other care needed to
create your treatment plan.

The removed tissue is examined by a
specialized doctor called a pathologist. A
pathologist is a doctor who specializes in
evaluating cells and tissues to diagnose
disease. The pathologist looks for abnormal
areas, including areas of cancer or pre-cancer.
The pathologist also determines the type of
cervical cancer, when possible.

wire is used instead of a scalpel to cut out the
cervical tissue.

Cone biopsy can be both a test and a
treatment. It may be used to gather more
information about the extent of the cancer after
a cervical biopsy. It is also a recommended
treatment option for some early cervical
cancers.

After removing the cone-shaped sample of
tissue, your doctor may use a spoon-shaped
tool called a curette to scrape a sample of
tissue from the cervical canal. This is called
endocervical curettage.
The tissue removed during a cone biopsy
is examined under a microscope by a
pathologist.

Also known as cervical conization, cone biopsy
involves removing a cone-shaped portion of
the cervix. The cone-shaped sample includes
tissue from both the ectocervix and the
endocervical canal. All of the transformation
zone—where the ectocervix and endocervix
meet—is removed. Most cervical cancers start
in this area.
Most commonly, a technique called cold knife
conization (CKC) is used. In this method a
surgical scalpel is used to remove the tissue.
In some cases loop electrosurgical excision
procedure (LEEP) may be performed instead.
In LEEP, a thin loop of electrified (heated)

Health history and physical
exam

Blood tests
The following blood tests may be ordered as
part of initial testing. They can provide helpful
information about your general health and the
health of your liver, kidneys, and other organs
before treatment.

To help plan treatment, expect your doctor
to ask about your past and current health,
including:







Illnesses, diseases, and surgeries

A complete blood count (CBC) is a
common test that measures the number of red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in a
sample of blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout the body. White blood cells fight
infection. Platelets help to control bleeding.

Medicines that you take (prescription or
over-the-counter)
Your lifestyle (your diet, activity level,
whether you smoke or drink alcohol)
Possible symptoms of cervical cancer,
such as watery vaginal discharge

A blood chemistry profile measures the
levels of different chemicals in your blood.
Chemicals in your blood are affected by your
kidneys, bones, and other organs and tissues.
Blood chemistry levels that are too high or too
low may be a sign that an organ is not working
well. Abnormal levels may also be caused by
the spread of cancer or by other diseases.

Your doctor will also do a physical exam of
your body, which may include:






Checking your vital signs (blood pressure,
heart rate, breathing rate, and body
temperature) and overall appearance
Feeling and/or listening to the organs in
your abdomen, including your liver and
stomach

Liver function tests are often done along
with a blood chemistry profile. The liver is an
organ that does many important jobs, such as
remove toxins from the blood. Liver function
tests measure enzymes that are made or
processed by the liver. Levels that are too high
or too low may be a sign of liver damage or
cancer spread.

A pelvic examination to check the size,
position, and appearance of your cervix
and uterus

It is important to let your doctor know if you
have trouble with pelvic exams due to pain,
anxiety, or other reasons.

If you have not had a recent human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test, or
have never been tested, your doctor may
recommend it. If you have HIV, you are likely
to be referred to an HIV specialist. Having HIV
should not affect your cancer treatment. The
treatment options described in this guide apply
to both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.

to feel flushed or get hives. You will be able to
hear and talk to the technician at all times. You
may hear buzzing or clicking during the scan.

Imaging helps determine the extent of the
cancer. The size and spread of the cancer is
used to guide treatment.

PET/CT
A CT scan may be combined with another
imaging test called positron emission
tomography (PET). PET uses small amounts of
radioactive materials called radiotracers. About
an hour before the scan, you will be injected
with a sugar radiotracer. The radiotracer gives
off a small amount of energy that can be seen
by the imaging machine. Cancer appears
brighter in the pictures because cancer cells
use sugar more quickly than normal cells.
In some cases, PET may be performed with
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (described
next) instead of CT.

Computed tomography
You may have a computed tomography (CT)
scan of your chest, abdomen, and/or pelvis.
A CT scan is a more detailed kind of x-ray. It
takes many pictures of an area inside the body
from different angles.
A computer combines the pictures to make
three-dimensional (3-D) images. During the
scan, you will lie face up on a table that moves
through a large tunnel-like machine. To see
everything better, a substance called contrast
may be injected into your vein and also mixed
with a liquid you drink. Contrast makes the CT
pictures clearer. The contrast may cause you

MRI
An MRI makes pictures of
areas inside the body without
using radiation. An MRI
can show the tissues of the
uterus, cervix, and vagina in
detail.

Magnetic resonance imaging

moves through a large tunnel in the scanning
machine. The scan may cause your body to
feel a bit warm. Like a CT scan, a contrast
agent will be used to make the pictures clearer.
MRI scans take longer to complete than CT
scans. The full exam can take an hour or
more. Tell your doctor if you get nervous in
tight spaces.

MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio
waves to make pictures of areas inside the
body. It is especially good at making clear
pictures of areas of soft tissue. Unlike a CT
scan or x-ray, MRI does not use radiation.
You may have an MRI of your pelvis. An MRI
can show the tissues of the uterus, cervix, and
vagina closely. An MRI may show whether the
cancer has spread to tissues next to the cervix,
such as the parametrium, vagina, bladder, or
rectum.

Transvaginal ultrasound
If you cannot have MRI of your pelvis, you may
have an ultrasound instead. Ultrasound uses
sound waves to make pictures of areas inside
of the body. It is good at showing the size,
shape, and location of the cervix.

For those with small cell neuroendocrine
carcinoma of the cervix (NECC), MRI of the
brain is also recommended as part of initial
testing.

In a transvaginal ultrasound, a probe will be
inserted into your vagina. This helps your
doctor see the cervix and nearby areas more
clearly.

Getting an MRI scan is similar to getting a
CT scan. You will lie face-up on a table that

Transvaginal ultrasound
Ultrasound uses sound waves
to make pictures of the inside
of the body. For a transvaginal
ultrasound, a probe is inserted
into the vagina. Ultrasounds are
generally painless, but you may
feel some discomfort when the
probe is inserted.

Testing and staging » Fertility and pregnancy

Fertility and pregnancy

Egg freezing
Unfertilized eggs can be removed, frozen, and
stored for later use. The medical term for this
is oocyte preservation.

If you want the option of becoming pregnant
in the future, talk to your care team about
fertility-sparing treatment. It is typically only
an option for small, early-stage cancers.
Recommendations for fertility-sparing
treatment are provided in Part 4: Treatment for
common types.

Surrogacy
If you have frozen embryos or frozen eggs
(oocytes), you may consider using a surrogate.
A surrogate (often a relative or friend)
volunteers to have the embryos inserted into
their uterus. They carry the pregnancy and
give birth.

If fertility preservation is desired, talk to
your doctor about seeing a reproductive
endocrinologist. Reproductive endocrinologists
are doctors that specialize in fertility. Although
natural pregnancy will not be possible, options
to discuss may include ovarian transposition,
egg or embryo freezing, and consideration of
possible surrogate pregnancy in the future.

For more information on fertility preservation,
see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients:
Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Ovarian transposition
Cervical cancer treatment may involve external
beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Radiation
damages the ovaries and causes them to
stop producing hormones needed for natural
pregnancy. Ovarian transposition is a surgery
that moves one or both ovaries out of the
range of the radiation beam. The medical
name for this procedure is oophoropexy.
Ovarian transposition before starting EBRT
may be an option if you are premenopausal
and have the most common type of cervical
cancer, squamous cell carcinoma.

Testing and staging » Other testing and care

Other testing and care
Checking the bladder and bowel
Your doctor may want to examine nearby
organs, like the bladder and bowel, for signs
of cancer. If these tests are needed, expect
to receive general anesthesia. This means
you will be fully sedated and unaware that the
procedure is taking place. These are referred
to as examinations under anesthesia (EUAs).

If you smoke or vape, seek
help to quit

Cystoscopy is a procedure to see inside
the bladder and other organs of the urinary
tract. It is performed using a hollow tool
with a magnifying lens at one end, called
a cystoscope. The cystoscope is inserted
through the urethra and guided into the
bladder.

If you smoke or vape, it’s important
to quit. Smoking can limit how well
cancer treatment works. Smoking
and vaping can also increase the risk
of lung problems during and after
chemotherapy. They also increase your
chances of developing other cancers.

Proctoscopy is a procedure to see inside the
anus and rectum. It is performed with a thin,
tube-like instrument with a light and magnifying
lens called a proctoscope.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco
that makes you want to keep smoking.
Nicotine withdrawal is challenging for
most people who smoke. The stress of
having cancer may make it even harder
to quit. If you smoke, ask your care
team about resources and programs
that can help you quit.

If abnormal or suspicious areas are seen
during cystoscopy or proctoscopy, tissue
samples will be removed and tested (biopsied).

Testing and staging » Staging

Staging
The results of imaging and the other testing
just described are used to determine the stage
(extent) of the cancer. Your treatment options
will depend on the cancer stage.
The International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics (FIGO) system is used to stage
cervical cancer. There are four main stages in
the FIGO system: I (1), II (2), III (3), and IV (4).
The stages are broken down into sub-stages
that have letters and may also have a number.
The following information is used to stage the
cancer in the FIGO system:


The size or extent/depth of the tumor



Whether any lymph nodes have cancer





Whether the cancer has spread to involve
nearby organs such as the bladder or
rectum
Whether the cancer has spread to distant
organs such as the liver, lungs, and/or
bone (metastasized)

The stages are explained and pictured on
the following pages. In general, people with
earlier cancer stages have better outcomes,
but not always. Some people will do better
than expected for their stage, and some will do
worse.

Cancer care plan

How well the treatment is working may change
the plan. Or you may change your mind about
treatment. Any of these changes may require a
new treatment plan.

Your treatment team
Treatment for cervical cancer often involves
a team of experts, including a gynecologic
oncologist, a medical oncologist, and a
radiation oncologist.

Stress and symptom control
Anxiety and depression are common in people
with cancer. At your cancer center, cancer
navigators, social workers, and others can
help. Help may include support groups, talk
therapy, exercising, spending time with loved
ones, or medication.

A gynecologic oncologist is an expert in
surgery and chemotherapy for female

You may be unemployed or miss work during
treatment. Or, you may have little or no health
insurance. Talk to your treatment team about
work, insurance, or money concerns. They will
include information in the treatment plan to
help you manage the costs of care.

Your primary care physician (PCP) and
gynecologist can also be a part of your team.
These health care providers can help you
express your feelings about your care to the
team. Treatment of other health problems may
be improved if they are aware of and involved
in your cancer care. In addition to doctors, you
may receive care from nurses, social workers,
and other health experts. Ask to have the
names and contact information of your health
care providers included in the treatment plan.

Cancer treatment
There isn't a treatment plan that is best
for everyone. There is often more than
one treatment option, including clinical
trials. Clinical trials study the safety and
effectiveness of investigational treatments.
The treatment that you and your doctors agree
on should be described in the treatment plan.
All known side effects should also be noted. It
is also important to note the goal of treatment
and the chance of a good treatment outcome.
Keep in mind that your treatment plan may
change. Testing may provide new information.

Supportive care

Side effects

Supportive care aims to relieve the symptoms
of cancer or the side effects of cancer
treatment. It can help relieve discomfort and
improve quality of life. Supportive care may be
given alone or with cancer treatment.

Managing side effects is a shared effort
between you and your care team. It is
important to speak up about bothersome
side effects, such as nausea and vomiting.
Ask about your options for managing or
relieving the effects of treatment.
More information on nausea and
vomiting is available at NCCN.org/

possibility of natural pregnancy in the future.

described. Your treatment options
will depend on the extent of the
cancer and other factors.

In a simple trachelectomy, only the cervix is
removed. In a radical trachelectomy, about 2
centimeters (less than a half inch) of vaginal
tissue is removed in addition to the cervix.
Both types can be performed either through
the vagina or the abdomen.

Surgery
Surgery is often the main treatment for earlystage cervical cancer. The types of surgery
that may be used are described below.

Hysterectomy

Removing only a portion of the cervix may
be an option for the earliest stage of cervical
cancer. In most cases, however, the entire
cervix must be removed. While this can
sometimes be performed through the vagina,
an abdominal incision (cut) is usually needed.
When the surgery is performed through a
traditional (big) incision through the abdomen,
the approach is known as laparotomy.

Hysterectomy is surgery to remove the
uterus (including the cervix). The types of
hysterectomy that may be used to treat
cervical cancer are described below.
An extrafascial (simple) hysterectomy
removes only the uterus (including the cervix).
Extrafascial hysterectomy can be performed
through the vagina, through the abdomen, or
using a minimally invasive approach. This type
is most commonly used for stage IA1 cancer.

Minimally invasive (also called laparoscopic)
surgery involves making only a few small
cuts into your body. There is usually less pain
and scarring compared to surgery that uses
a larger cut through the abdomen. The time it
takes to recover is also usually shorter.

A modified radical hysterectomy removes the
uterus (including the cervix), a portion of the
connective tissue that holds the cervix in place,
and about a half inch or less of the vagina.
Modified radical hysterectomy is performed
through the abdomen.

Cone biopsy

A radical hysterectomy removes the uterus
(including the cervix), much of the connective
tissue that holds the cervix in place, and the
top quarter or third of the vagina. Radical
hysterectomy is performed through the
abdomen.

Cone biopsy involves removing a cone-shaped
section of the cervix that includes tissue from
both the ectocervix and endocervix. It is a
recommended treatment option for some small
cervical cancers. See Part 2: Testing and
staging for more information on cone biopsy.

are the sentinel nodes. They are removed and
tested for cancer.

your surgeon will explain the procedure
recommended for you in detail.
Ovary preservation
The ovaries may or may not be removed
during hysterectomy. If you have not entered
menopause, surgery that removes both ovaries
will cause menopause. This is referred to as
surgical menopause. It is caused by the sudden
drop in estrogen in the body. There are shortand long-term symptoms and risks of surgical
menopause that can greatly affect quality of
life. When caused by surgery, the symptoms of
menopause may be sudden and more severe.

Testing the removed nodes helps determine
the extent (spread) of the cancer. Removing
lymph nodes can also help limit the spread of
cancer cells through lymph. The closest lymph
nodes to the cervix are the pelvic nodes.
Cervical cancer generally spreads to these
nodes first. Lymph nodes in the abdomen,
called the para-aortic nodes, are also
sometimes removed.

Symptoms include hot flashes, sleeping
problems, night sweats, weight gain, and
changes in mood. Vaginal atrophy is another
common symptom. Vaginal atrophy is a
condition in which the lining of the vagina
becomes thin, dry, and inflamed. Longterm risks of not having enough estrogen
include cardiovascular disease and bone loss
(osteoporosis).

Pre-treatment surgical staging
If the cancer has spread beyond the cervix, a
hysterectomy is not performed but pelvic and/
or para-aortic lymph nodes may be removed
and tested before any treatment is given.
Knowing whether pelvic or para-aortic nodes
contain cancer can help guide treatment
decisions for more advanced cancers. A
minimally invasive approach is typically used
to access and remove the lymph nodes. This is
referred to as laparoscopic surgical staging.

If hysterectomy is being considered, ask your
doctor if keeping your ovaries is appropriate.

Lymph node dissection
Cancer cells can travel through blood and
lymph. Lymph is a clear fluid that carries
infection-fighting white blood cells. Lymph
nodes are bean-shaped glands found
throughout the body. They contain immune cells
that help the body fight infection and disease.
During surgery for cervical cancer, lymph
nodes may be removed in order to be
tested for cancer. This is called lymph node
dissection or lymphadenectomy. In order to
identify and remove the lymph node(s) most
likely to contain cancer, a sentinel lymph
node biopsy may be performed. This
involves injecting a special dye or a radioactive

Types of treatment » External beam radiation therapy

External beam radiation
therapy

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
is a highly specialized type of EBRT used to
treat metastatic cervical cancer. High doses of
radiation are delivered to tumors in the liver,
lungs, or bone using very precise beams.
Treatment is typically delivered in 5 or fewer
sessions.

Radiation therapy uses high-energy waves
similar to x-rays to kill cancer cells. In external
beam radiation therapy (EBRT), a large
machine aims radiation at the cancer site. The
radiation passes through skin and other tissue
to reach the tumor and nearby lymph nodes.
EBRT is given in small doses, called fractions.

Side effects
Common side effects during the 5 to 6 weeks
of EBRT include fatigue, skin redness and
irritation, diarrhea, nausea, and frequent or
painful urination. Most of these side effects
develop gradually. They increase during
treatment and gradually decrease once
treatment is over.

An advanced type of EBRT called intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is often
used to treat cervical cancer. IMRT uses
many small beams of different strengths. This
allows a high dose of radiation to reach the
tumor while limiting the amount of radiation
to the surrounding normal tissue. With IMRT
it is possible to reduce radiation to important
nearby organs and structures, such as the
bowel, bladder, external genitalia, and hip
joints. This can help reduce treatment-related
side effects.

When the ovaries are included in the radiation
field, it causes premature (early) menopause.
The symptoms are similar to those caused
by surgical menopause, as described above.

radiation beam. This procedure may be an
option if you are premenopausal and have
the most common type of cervical cancer,
squamous cell carcinoma.
Otherwise, your doctor may consider the
use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)
after radiation therapy has completed.
This approach used to be called hormone
replacement therapy or HRT. Hormone therapy
for menopause helps lessen some of the side
effects of radiation-induced menopause. See
Part 6: Survivorship for more information.

Chemoradiation
EBRT and chemotherapy are often used
together to treat cervical cancer. They
are given concurrently (during the same
time period) in a treatment strategy
called chemoradiation. Chemoradiation is
recommended for most locally advanced
cervical cancers. These cancers have grown
beyond the cervix but have not spread to the
liver, lungs, or bones.

Radiation therapy for cervical cancer can also
have long-term and serious side effects on
fertility, sexual health, and bowel and bladder
function.

What to expect

As part of chemoradiation, there are typically 5
EBRT treatment sessions per week for 5 to 6
weeks. Chemotherapy is typically given once
weekly during this time. See page 37 for more
information on chemotherapy.

A planning session, called simulation, is
needed before EBRT begins. You will first be
placed in the treatment position. You will be
asked to lie on your back and stay very still.
You may get fitted for a prop to help you stay
still during the radiation sessions.
Pictures of the cancer site(s) will be obtained
with a CT scan. Using the CT images and
sophisticated computer software, your
radiation oncologist will make a treatment plan.
The plan will specify the radiation dose(s)
and the number of sessions you will need.
There will be several days between the time of
simulation and the beginning of your treatment
sessions. This allows sufficient time for careful
treatment planning, dose calculation, and
quality assurance.
During treatment, you will lie on a table as
you did for simulation. Devices may be used
to keep you from moving. This helps to target
the tumor. Ink marks (tattoos) on your skin will
help position your body accurately for daily

Types of treatment » Brachytherapy

Brachytherapy

sedation is often required, especially for the
first applicator placement.

Also known as internal radiation therapy,
brachytherapy involves treatment with
radioactive material placed inside the body.
Brachytherapy allows a high dose of radiation
to be targeted at the tumor while limiting the
amount delivered to surrounding normal tissue.

The applicator is placed to align with the
tissue targeted for treatment. Often, an
imaging technique (MRI or CT) is used to
guide placement of the applicator. These
images are used to design the brachytherapy
treatment plan. The applicator is connected to
a brachytherapy machine. A radiation source
travels from the machine through the hollow
tubes and into the applicator. Treatment takes
about 10 minutes.

During brachytherapy, instruments are
placed into the cervix, uterus, and vagina.
A radioactive material then travels into the
instruments that have been placed in the
body. This method is known as intracavitary
brachytherapy. Sometimes, additional
instruments (catheters, or thin hollow tubes)
are placed in the tumor itself or in tissues next
to the tumor (interstitial brachytherapy). For
the treatment of cervical cancer, intracavitary
brachytherapy is most often used. Interstitial
brachytherapy is a specialized technique
that is used for more advanced cancers that
involve the parametrium. It is best performed
at cancer centers with experience in this
method.

Sometimes brachytherapy is given as
treatments over a couple days. In this case,
the instruments are placed and left in the body
until all the treatments have been given (1 to
2 days). You will need to remain in bed until
treatment is complete so that the instruments
don’t move.
Brachytherapy is typically started in the final
week or right after completing EBRT. Shrinking
the tumor with EBRT first allows for better
placement of the brachytherapy applicators.
Treatment with both types of radiation therapy
can be completed within 7 to 8 weeks.

Brachytherapy for cervical cancer may be
given in short bursts, called high dose-rate
(HDR) brachytherapy, or in long bursts, called
low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy. Most
centers currently use HDR brachytherapy.
Treatment is typically given in 3 to 5 sessions
over 2 weeks.

Side effects
The side effects of brachytherapy are similar to
those of EBRT and include:

If you have not had a hysterectomy, a device
called an applicator is inserted into the
uterus through the vagina. A “tandem and
ring” applicator is commonly used for HDR
brachytherapy. The tandem is a long, thin
tube that extends into the uterus. The ring is a
hollow circle that stays in the vagina, pressed
against the cervix. A tandem and ovoid
applicator uses hollow, rounded capsules
instead of a ring. General anesthesia or deep

Systemic therapy

cervical cancer that returns or spreads after
treatment with chemotherapy.

Systemic therapy is treatment with substances
that travel in the bloodstream, reaching cells
throughout the body. Chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and immunotherapy are types of
systemic therapy.

Side effects of systemic therapy
Systemic therapy can kill healthy cells in
addition to cancer cells. The damage to
healthy cells causes potentially harsh side
effects. The side effects of chemotherapy
depend on many factors, including the drug(s),
the dose, and the person. In general, side
effects are caused by the death of fast-growing
cells, which are found in the intestines, mouth,
and blood. As a result, common side effects
include:

Most systemic therapies are given
intravenously. This means they are slowly
infused into your bloodstream through a vein.
Infusions are often given in cycles of treatment
days followed by days of rest. This allows your
body to recover between cycles.

Chemotherapy
Platinum-based chemotherapy is the most
commonly used systemic therapy for cervical
cancer. It stops the growth of cancer cells,
either by killing the cells or by stopping them
from dividing.
Cisplatin is generally preferred for platinumbased chemotherapy. If cisplatin is expected
to be too harsh or cannot be given for other
reasons, a different platinum drug called
carboplatin may be used instead.
As part of treatment with chemoradiation,
cisplatin is typically given on a 7-day cycle
(once weekly) for 5 to 6 weeks. When used for
recurrent or metastatic cancer, infusions are
typically given once every 3 weeks.

Targeted therapy and
immunotherapy

Ask your treatment team for a list of common
and rare side effects of each systemic therapy
you are receiving. There are ways to prevent
or alleviate some of these effects.

Targeted therapy and immunotherapy
are newer types of systemic therapy.
Unlike chemotherapy, targeted therapy
and immunotherapy are most effective at

general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety, and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,

recommended treatment options
for the most common types

If fertility-sparing treatment is being
considered, ask your doctor about getting
the opinion of a reproductive endocrinologist.
Reproductive endocrinologists are doctors that
specialize in fertility. A fertility-sparing approach
is not appropriate for some uncommon types
of cervical cancer.

of cervical cancer. Surgery is
usually recommended for earlystage cancers, while most locally
advanced cancers are treated with
chemoradiation.

Stage 1A1
Cone biopsy is recommended for stage 1A1
cancers without known LVSI. If the results
are good, no further treatment is needed. If
the results suggest that the cancer was not
completely removed, you may have another
cone biopsy. Or, your doctor may recommend
radical trachelectomy.

This section applies to the following types of
cervical cancer:


Squamous cell carcinoma



Adenocarcinoma



Adenosquamous carcinoma

For stage 1A1 cancers with LVSI,
treatment with either cone biopsy or radical
trachelectomy is recommended. Pelvic lymph
node evaluation should also be performed. If
trachelectomy is planned, see the next page
for information on treatment after surgery.

Treatment is based on the cancer stage. The
stage describes how far the cancer has likely
spread based on imaging and other testing.
A risk factor that guides treatment for cervical
cancer is lymphovascular space invasion
(LVSI). LVSI means that there are tumor cells
in the blood vessels or lymph vessels inside
the tumor. Cancers with LVSI are more likely to
spread to nearby lymph nodes. Nearby lymph
nodes are more likely to be removed.

Stage 1A2
Cone biopsy is an option for some very-lowrisk stage 1A2 cancers. The tumor must be
smaller than 2 centimeters, there must be no
LVSI, and other criteria must be met. Pelvic
lymph node evaluation is performed in addition
to the cone biopsy.

Fertility-sparing treatment

For stage 1A2 cancers with LVSI,
treatment with either cone biopsy or radical
trachelectomy is recommended. Pelvic
lymph node evaluation is also performed. If
trachelectomy is planned, see the next page
for information on treatment after surgery.

Surgical treatment for early-stage cervical
cancer often involves surgery that removes the
uterus (hysterectomy). Carrying a pregnancy is
not possible after a hysterectomy. If the cancer
has not spread beyond the cervix (stage 1),
fertility-sparing treatment may be an option,
if desired. This approach involves surgery

Treatment for common types » Fertility-sparing treatment

Stage 1B1

Treatment after surgery

Cone biopsy is an option for some very-lowrisk stage 1B1 cancers. The tumor must be
smaller than 2 cm, there must be no LVSI, and
other criteria must be met. Pelvic lymph node
evaluation is also performed.

If testing finds no cancer in tissue beyond
the cervix or in lymph nodes removed during
surgery, there are 2 options. External beam
radiation therapy (EBRT) is recommended
for cancers with risk factors. Observation is
recommended for cancers without risk factors.
Your doctor will consider the tumor size,
whether there is LVSI, and other factors when
determining if EBRT is a good choice for you.

For stage 1B1 cancers that do not meet the
criteria for cone biopsy, radical trachelectomy
with pelvic lymph node evaluation is
recommended. Lymph nodes in the abdomen
(para-aortic nodes) may be removed in
addition to pelvic lymph nodes.

If EBRT is planned, platinum chemotherapy
may be given during the same time period.
This is called chemoradiation.

Stage 1B2

If cancer is found in any pelvic or paraaortic lymph nodes, or in any tissues outside
the cervix, treatment with chemoradiation is
recommended. Vaginal brachytherapy may
be given in addition to EBRT and platinum
chemotherapy.

Fertility-sparing surgery is not performed
often for stage 1B2 cancers. Because most
research on fertility-sparing surgery applies to
smaller tumors, abdominal surgery is generally
preferred.

Fertility-sparing treatment
Fertility-sparing treatment may
be an option, if desired, for

may recommend another cone biopsy to
confirm that the cancer is actually stage
1A1. If pre-cancer is found at the margins,
either an extrafascial (simple) hysterectomy
or a modified radical hysterectomy is
recommended. Lymph nodes in the pelvis may
be removed during either type of hysterectomy.

Surgery is recommended for most early-stage
cancers. Treatment with EBRT alone or with
chemoradiation may be recommended after
surgery.

Stage 1B2 and 2A1

Treatment after surgery

Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node
evaluation is recommended for these stages.
Lymph nodes in the abdomen (para-aortic
nodes) may be removed in addition to pelvic
lymph nodes.

After surgery, the pathologic (surgical) stage
of the cancer is determined by examining the
removed tissue. The following information
applies to the stages below, as determined by
surgery:

Stage 1B3 and 2A2



Stage 1

Stage 1B3 cancers are larger than 4 cm (about
the size of a walnut) but do not extend beyond
the cervix. Stage 2A2 cancers are also larger
than 4 cm and extend into the upper vagina.



Stage 2A

If testing finds no cancer in tissue beyond
the cervix or in lymph nodes removed during
surgery, there are 2 options. External beam
radiation therapy (EBRT) is recommended
for cancers with risk factors. Observation is
recommended for cancers without risk factors.
Your doctor will consider the tumor size,
whether there is LVSI, and other factors when
determining if EBRT is a good choice for you.

These cancers may be treated as earlystage (with surgery) or as locally advanced
(with chemoradiation and brachytherapy).
At this time, treatment with chemoradiation
is preferred. See the next page for more
information on this option.

If EBRT is planned, platinum chemotherapy
may be given during the same time period.
This is called chemoradiation.

If surgery is planned, radical hysterectomy and
pelvic lymph node dissection is recommended.
Lymph nodes in the abdomen (para-aortic
nodes) may also be removed.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cervical Cancer, 2024

If cancer is found in any pelvic or paraaortic lymph nodes, or in any tissues outside
the cervix, treatment with chemoradiation is
recommended. Vaginal brachytherapy may
be given in addition to EBRT and platinum
chemotherapy.

45

Treatment for common types » Locally advanced cancer

Locally advanced cancer

If cancer is found in pelvic lymph nodes, EBRT
will include the pelvis. If any para-aortic nodes
are known or suspected to have cancer, EBRT
will be given to a larger treatment area that
includes these nodes as well.

This section describes treatment options for
cervical cancer that has grown beyond the
cervix but has not spread to the liver, lungs,
or bones. Cancers that are close to spreading
beyond the cervix (stage 1B3) are also
considered locally advanced. Locally advanced
cancers are not metastatic.

While treatment as described above is
currently preferred for stage 1B3 and 2A2
cancers, surgery is sometimes recommended.

The information in this section applies to the
following stages:


Stage 1B3 and 2A2



Stage 2B



Stage 3



Stage 4A

Locally advanced cancers are more likely to
have spread to lymph nodes than early-stage
cancers. Knowing whether lymph nodes in the
pelvis or abdomen contain cancer can help
guide treatment with EBRT for these cancers.
You may have extra imaging to look for lymph
nodes with cancer.

Let us know what
you think!
Please take a moment to
complete an online survey
about the

Another approach is to surgically remove
and test lymph nodes before any treatment is
given. A minimally invasive method is typically
used to access and remove the lymph nodes.
This is called surgical staging. If surgical
staging is performed, the para-aortic lymph
nodes are typically removed. Pelvic lymph
nodes may or may not be removed.

Surveillance

Imaging

After finishing treatment, you will have testing
to look for early signs of possible recurrence.
This is known as surveillance. The information
that follows applies to surveillance for common
types of cervical cancer and for small cell
neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix
(NECC).

Unlike physical exams, imaging is generally
not needed at regular intervals for an
extended time after treatment. Imaging is
typically ordered if you have new or worsening
symptoms, or if other findings suggest
recurrence or spread. Follow-up imaging
is described below according to the cancer
stage.

Physical exams

Stage 1
If you had radiation or chemoradiation
after non–fertility-sparing treatment, or if
the cancer is stage 1B3, you may have a
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission
tomography/computed tomography (FDGPET/CT) scan 3 to 6 months after finishing
treatment. The area from the neck to the midthigh is typically scanned.

Physical exams performed by your oncologist
are an important part of surveillance,
especially in the first 5 years after treatment.
At these follow-up visits, tell your doctor about
any changes in your health. Such changes
include new or worsening symptoms and other
health conditions or concerns.
The recommended time frames for these
follow-up visits are as follows:

After fertility-sparing treatment, you may have
an MRI of your pelvis (with contrast) 6 months
after surgery and then yearly for 2 to 3 years.

Years 1 and 2: Every 3 to 6 months

Stages 2, 3, and 4A
Imaging is recommended 3 to 6 months after
treatment for stage 2, 3, and 4A cervical
cancers. An FDG-PET/CT scan is preferred,
but a CT with contrast is also a recommended
option. The area from the neck to the mid-thigh
will be scanned.

Years 3, 4, and 5: Every 6 to 12 months
After year 5: Once a year or as agreed upon
with your doctor

Time frame ranges are used to allow for
differences in individual risk of recurrence
and in patient and provider preference. Those
considered at higher risk of recurrence may
benefit from more frequent exams than those
with a lower risk.

Other imaging for these stages may include
a pelvic MRI with contrast 3 to 6 months after
finishing treatment.

After the fifth year, visits are generally spaced
out to once per year. Or you and your doctor
may agree on a different schedule after
discussing your personal risk of recurrence.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Cervical Cancer, 2024

Metastatic cancer
For stage 4B or distant recurrences of cervical
cancer, imaging is used mainly to learn how
the cancer is responding to systemic therapy.
Imaging may include CT, MRI, and/or PET/CT.

Treatment for common types » Recurrence

Recurrence

Pap tests
Depending on the type of surgery you have
(if any), you may have annual Pap screening
tests after treatment. Pap testing is helpful for
finding new areas of abnormal and/or precancerous cells. It is not as good at detecting
recurrent cervical cancer. Pap testing is also
known as cervical or vaginal cytology.

This section discusses cervical cancer that
does not improve with treatment (persistent) or
that returns after treatment (recurrent). If your
doctor suspects recurrence based on your
symptoms or a physical exam, you will have
imaging tests to check. This could include CT,
PET, and/or MRI.

Blood tests

Surgery to look inside the body (exploratory
surgery) may be helpful in some cases. The
goal is to learn the extent of the cancer. This
can help guide treatment decisions.

If you have symptoms, or a physical exam was
suspicious for recurrence, your doctor may
order blood tests.

Biomarker testing

In addition to a complete blood count (CBC),
testing may measure blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) and creatinine levels. These check your
kidney function. Liver function tests may also
be ordered.

Biomarkers are features of a cancer that can
help guide treatment. Biomarkers are often
mutations (changes) in particular genes. They
can also be proteins that are made in response
to the cancer.

Survivorship

Biomarker testing is recommended for all
recurrent cervical cancers. The results help
determine whether treatment with certain
targeted therapies is an option. The results
can also be used to determine whether you
can join certain clinical trials. Some doctors
order biomarker testing early in the course of
treatment. Many doctors wait and order it only
if the cancer returns or spreads.

In addition to surveillance testing, a range of
other care is important for cancer survivors.
This includes keeping alert for symptoms of
cancer recurrence. See Part 6: Survivorship for
more information.

Testing should be performed on tumor tissue
removed during a biopsy or surgery when
possible. Otherwise, a sample of blood may
be tested instead. Other names for this testing
include molecular testing, tumor profiling,
genomic testing, tumor gene testing, nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), mutation testing,
and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP).
Testing for PD-L1 expression is
recommended for everyone with recurrent,
progressive, or metastatic cervical cancer. If

the PD-L1 level exceeds a set cutoff point,
the cancer is considered PD-L1-positive.
If needed, treatment with certain targeted
therapies or immunotherapies may be an
option for PD-L1–positive tumors.

Pelvic exenteration

in cervical cancer but should still be tested for.


Mismatch repair (MMR)



Microsatellite instability (MSI)



Tumor mutational burden (TMB)

Pelvic exenteration is a radical surgery that
involves removing multiple organs from the
pelvis. The goal is to cure the cancer by
removing all of the organs to which cancer has
or may spread.
All remaining organs of the female
reproductive system are removed during
pelvic exenteration. This includes the uterus,
fallopian tubes, ovaries, and vagina. Nearby
organs in the pelvis including the bladder,
rectum, and/or anus may also be removed.

NTRK gene fusion (for those with a
cervical sarcoma)





RET gene fusion

If cancer returns to the pelvis

If the bladder and/or organs involved in bowel
function are removed, a diversion is typically
performed. Diversions are surgical procedures
that divert (redirect) urine and/or stool to new
openings through which they exit the body.

Cervical cancer that returns to the pelvis only
is known as a local or regional recurrence. If
the area has not been treated with radiation
and the cancer can be surgically removed,
this is generally preferred. After surgery, EBRT
and systemic therapy are recommended.
Brachytherapy may also be given.

Vaginal reconstruction
It is often possible to reconstruct the vagina
after pelvic exenteration. A surgeon can
create an artificial vagina using muscle from
another area of your body. A muscle in the
lower abdomen called the rectus abdominus
is often used for vaginal reconstruction. This
procedure is sometimes referred to as muscle
flap reconstruction.

If the area has already been treated with
radiation and it is no longer an option, possible
treatment options are listed below. The best
option(s) for you will depend on the specific
location of the new cancer growth in the pelvis.

If the bladder is removed
An ileal (incontinent) conduit is one type of
urinary diversion. After the bladder is removed,
your surgeon will create a new tube from a
piece of intestine (ileum). This tube will allow
your kidneys to drain. Your urine will now exit
the body through a small opening called a
stoma. A small disposable bag attached to the
outside of your abdomen collects the urine.

separate until they exit the body through the
same stoma. Compared to having separate
urinary and fecal diversions, DBWC has been
found to have other benefits, such as fewer
leaks.

This is called an ostomy bag or ostomy pouch.
The bag stays attached to your body with
the help of an adhesive part called a “wafer.”
The wafer sticks to the skin and acts as a
watertight barrier.
Another way urine may be redirected after
removing the bladder is a continent urinary
diversion. It is also referred to as an artificial
bladder or “Indiana pouch.” This method uses
a segment of intestine to create a pouch to
hold urine. The pouch has a channel for urine
to pass through made from intestine that
connects it to the wall of the abdomen.

Metastatic cancer
If left untreated, or if not diagnosed early,
cervical cancer often spreads to the liver,
lungs, and/or bone. Cervical cancer that has
spread to these organs is metastatic. Cancer
that had already metastasized when it was
found is stage 4B. If cancer returns and
metastasizes after treatment, it is known as
a distant recurrence. The information in this
section applies to both types of metastatic
disease.

A stoma is made in the abdominal wall at the
location of the reservoir. Sometimes the stoma
can be made in the belly button, making it
less noticeable. To drain urine, a catheter is
inserted into the reservoir several times a day.
A benefit to this type of urinary diversion is that
an ostomy bag does not need to be worn on
the outside of the body.

Metastatic cervical cancer is very hard to cure.
Treatment is usually with systemic therapy.
The goal is to keep the cancer under control
and prevent further spread. If the tumor has
not already been tested for biomarkers, it may
be tested now. Biomarker testing can help
determine whether you may be eligible for
certain targeted therapies or immunotherapies.

If the rectum is removed
If the rectum is removed, a permanent
colostomy may be created. A colostomy
connects the remaining colon to the outside
of the abdomen. Stool exits the body through
a stoma and goes into a bag attached to the
skin. In some cases, the remaining colon
can be connected to the remaining rectum or
anus and a permanent colostomy may not be
required. You may retain near-normal bowel
function. If the anus is removed during the
surgery, a permanent colostomy is always
needed.

It may be possible to remove or destroy the
new cancer growth(s) using one or more of the
treatments listed below.

If both the bowel and bladder are removed
If both urinary and fecal diversion are needed,
a double-barreled wet colostomy (DBWC)
is sometimes used. In this technique, only
one opening (stoma) on the surface of the
abdomen is needed. Urine and stool are kept

Supportive care

You may also consider enrolling in a clinical
trial. Ask your treatment team if there is an
open clinical trial that you can join.

Supportive care is available to everyone
with metastatic cervical cancer, regardless
of whether you are in active treatment.
Supportive care refers to a range of care
and resources often needed by patients with
metastatic cancer. Hospice care, access to
pain specialists, and emotional and spiritual
support are all components of supportive
care. Because metastatic cancer cannot be
cured, the main goal of supportive care is to
make you more comfortable and to help keep
the cancer under control. Supportive care
may also help you live longer and feel better
overall. When used for advanced cancers,
supportive care is often called palliative care.

Advance care planning
Talking with your doctor about your prognosis
can help with treatment planning. If the cancer
cannot be controlled or cured, a care plan for
the end of life can be made. There are many
benefits to advance care planning, including:

Knowing what to expect

Another part of the planning involves hospice
care. Hospice care does not include treatment
to fight the cancer but rather to reduce
symptoms caused by cancer. Hospice care
may be started because you do not wish to
continue treatment, because no other cancer
treatment is available, or because you are too
sick for treatment.

Locally advanced

Hospice care allows you to have the best
quality of life possible. Care is given all day,
every day of the week. You can choose to
have hospice care at home or at a hospice
center. One study found that patients and
caregivers had a better quality of life when
hospice care was started early.

Surgery may be an option for

The most common type of NECC is small cell.
Treatment for small cell NECC is the focus of
this section.

A second option for tumors 4 cm or smaller is
treatment with chemoradiation (chemotherapy
and EBRT) and brachytherapy. When
treatment is over, your doctor may recommend
additional systemic therapy.

Treatment often involves chemotherapy, alone
or as part of chemoradiation. The following
regimens are preferred for chemotherapy:


cisplatin + etoposide



carboplatin + etoposide

Tumors larger than 4 cm
One option for tumors 4 cm or larger
is treatment with chemoradiation and
brachytherapy first. More chemotherapy may
follow.

If you cannot have either of these, there
are other recommended options. For
chemoradiation, cisplatin + etoposide is
preferred. If you cannot have cisplatin,
carboplatin is often used instead.

Another possibility is that chemotherapy will
be given first to try to shrink the cancer. If
chemotherapy works well, surgery (radical
hysterectomy) may be performed. If you have
this surgery, treatment with EBRT alone or
chemoradiation may be given next. More
chemotherapy may follow.

NECC tumors can contain cells from more
common types of cervical cancer, including
squamous cell carcinoma. If a cancer contains
both NECC cells and cells from a more
common type, the cancer is treated as NECC.

If radical hysterectomy is not performed,
treatment with chemoradiation (EBRT and
chemotherapy) and brachytherapy is the next
step. More chemotherapy may follow.

Treatment for neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix » Locally advanced NECC

Locally advanced NECC

If the cancer spreads to the liver, lungs, or
bone (metastasizes), see “Metastatic cancer”
in Part 4: Treatment for common types.
Recommendations for treating metastatic
cancer apply to common cervical cancers and
to NECC.

The term "locally advanced" is used to
describe cervical cancer that has grown
beyond the uterus but has not spread to the
liver, lungs, or bone. This includes stage 2,
3, and 4A cancers. Cancers that are close
to spreading beyond the uterus (stage 1B3)
are also considered locally advanced. Locally
advanced cancers are non-metastatic.

Supportive care
Supportive care is always an option. This
care is available to everyone with persistent,
recurrent, or metastatic cancer, regardless
of whether you are in active treatment.
Supportive care refers to a range of resources
offered to patients with advanced or metastatic
cancer. Hospice care, access to pain
specialists, and emotional and spiritual support
are all components of supportive care.

At this time, treatment with chemoradiation and
brachytherapy is preferred for locally advanced
NECC. When these treatments are over, you
may have more chemotherapy with the same
regimen.
The other recommended strategy is treatment
with chemotherapy first, followed by
chemoradiation and brachytherapy.

Because the cancer cannot be cured, the main
goal of supportive care is to make you more
comfortable and to help keep the cancer under
control. Supportive care may also help you
live longer and feel better overall. When used
for advanced cancers, supportive care is often
called palliative care.

After initial treatment
If initial treatment works well, surveillance will
begin. Surveillance involves testing to look
for early signs of recurrence. The surveillance
strategy for more common types of cervical
cancer is also recommended for NECC. See
page 47 for information.

Consider a clinical trial
Enrolling in a clinical trial allows you to receive
treatment while helping researchers learn
more about this rare cancer. Ask your care
team if you qualify for any current clinical trials.
Clinical trials are discussed in more detail at
the end of Part 3: Types of treatment.

If the cancer does not improve with initial
treatment, it is known as “persistent.” Options
for treating persistent NECC that is only in the
pelvis may include:

control as well as sexual function and arousal.
There are ways to strengthen these muscles
before and after treatment. This is known as
pelvic floor physical therapy, and there are
health care professionals who specialize in
it. Pelvic floor therapy can include at-home
exercises to tighten and release the vaginal
and anal muscles (Kegel exercises) as well as
hands-on techniques by a physical therapist.
Ask your treatment team for help finding a
pelvic floor specialist in your area.

Some side effects of cervical cancer
treatment can start early and linger longer
than expected. Others may not appear until
long after treatment is over. Many cervical
cancer survivors experience changes in bowel,
urinary, and sexual function. More general
effects such as fatigue, trouble breathing, and
difficulty sleeping (insomnia) are also common.
The extent and degree of symptoms vary
widely between patients. Ask your treatment
team for a complete list of possible late and
long-term side effects.

Infertility and premature
menopause
Surgically removing the ovaries or exposing
them to radiation causes a sudden drop in
estrogen and progesterone. This results
in infertility, and possibly also menopausal
symptoms. These include stopping of periods,
hot flashes, night sweats, weight gain, and
mood changes.

Bowel and bladder changes
Urinary incontinence (the inability to hold urine
in the bladder) and urgency (a sudden, strong
need to urinate) are possible after surgery or
radiation therapy for cervical cancer. Watery
and/or frequent bowel movements (diarrhea)
are also possible. Occasional bleeding
may occur either with urination or bowel
movements. Pelvic floor physical therapy,
described next, can help with bowel and
bladder changes.

The lining of the vagina can become thin, dry,
and inflamed. This is called vaginal atrophy.
Not having enough estrogen can also have
long-term risks, including heart disease and
bone loss (osteoporosis).

Ostomy care

When these hormonal changes cause
symptoms of menopause, menopausal
hormone therapy (MHT) may be an option.
This can include systemic (oral or intravenous)
estrogen (combined with progestins for those
with a uterus intact) and vaginal applications
of estrogen. Discussion with a specialized
menopausal symptom team may be helpful to
determine whether this treatment is right for
you.

If you have an ostomy, you want to join an
ostomy support group. Another option is to
see a health care provider that specializes
in ostomy care, such as an ostomy nurse.
People with ostomies can still live very active
lifestyles. Consider consulting with an ostomy
professional before undertaking vigorous
physical activity.

Pelvic floor physical therapy

Vaginal moisturizers

The pelvic floor is a group of muscles that
supports the organs of the pelvis. These
muscles play a key role in bowel and bladder

You can start using a dilator as soon as 2 to 4
weeks after radiation therapy has ended and
can continue to use it for as long as you want.

to become dry and less stretchy. To offset
this side effect, use of water-based vaginal
moisturizers is highly encouraged. Like
moisturizers for your body, vaginal moisturizers
restore moisture to the vagina and help to
keep the vaginal tissue healthy. Vaginal
moisturizers can be used daily. Many come
with applicators to make using them easier.
Vaginal estrogen cream or tablets may be
particularly helpful where there has been
thinning of the vaginal and vulvar tissues due
to loss of estrogen.

Vaginal dilators are not one-size-fits-all.
Different sizes are available, as are dilator kits
containing different size devices. The size of
the dilator can be increased over time as the
vagina lengthens and widens.

Sexual health
Sexual side effects can occur after cervical
cancer treatment, including:

Vaginal dilator therapy
Radiation therapy to the pelvic area can
cause the vagina to become shorter and
narrower. This is called vaginal stenosis.
Vaginal stenosis can make it uncomfortable or
even painful to have sex, or to have vaginal
examinations by a doctor. Vaginal dilator
therapy can be used to lessen the effects of
vaginal stenosis. A vaginal dilator is a device
used to gradually stretch or widen the vagina.

Reduced sex drive (libido)



Vaginal dryness



Pain during sex

Narrowing and shortening of the vagina
(vaginal stenosis)

While it may be uncomfortable to talk about
sexual health, keep in mind that these
side effects are common and can often be

Mental wellness
Expect your care team to ask about
your mental health. If they don’t,
speak up. There are many resources
available that can improve mental

managed or lessened. Consider seeing a
sexual health therapist. These health care
professionals specialize in helping cancer
survivors and others overcome and manage
sexual side effects of cancer treatment. Many
cancer treatment centers have programs
focused solely on sexual health after cancer
treatment. Ask your doctor about resources
available through your cancer center that can
help minimize the impact of cancer treatment
on your sexual health.

Nerve damage
Chemotherapy can damage the sensory
nerves. This is known as neuropathy. The
damage can result in pain, numbness, tingling,
swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts
of the body. It often begins in the hands or feet
and gets worse over time. Neuropathic pain is
often described as a shooting or burning pain.

Mental health and wellness

Swelling

It can be hard to cope with the effects of
cancer and its treatment. Many survivors
report having a lower quality of life after
cancer treatment. Depression, anxiety,
fear of recurrence, and trouble adjusting
to changes in the body are possible. Many
people also have financial stressors, such as
concerns or hesitation about returning to work
and insurance coverage issues. Personal
relationships, sexuality, and intimacy may also
be affected by a cancer diagnosis or cancer
treatment.

Treatment for cervical cancer often involves
removing lymph nodes during surgery. Lymph
may not drain properly after lymph nodes are
removed. This can result in lymphedema.
Lymphedema is swelling caused by a build-up
of lymph fluid in tissues. It most often occurs in
the lower body for cervical cancer survivors.

If you are anxious, distressed, depressed, or
are just having trouble coping with life after
cancer, you are not alone. Tell your treatment
team about these symptoms. Expect your
treatment team to ask about your mental
health. If they don’t, speak up. There are many
resources available that can improve mental
health and wellness for cancer survivors.
Social workers at your treatment center are
often excellent resources to help connect you
with mental health and financial resources.

bones in the pelvis, putting you at increased

Get screened for other types of cancer, such
as breast, skin, and colorectal cancer. Talk to
your primary care doctor about recommended
cancer screening tests for your age and risk
level.

Survivorship Care for Healthy Living
Survivorship Care for Cancer-Related
Late and Long-Term Effects

Get other recommended health care such
as blood pressure screening and hepatitis C
screening, and immunizations (such as the flu
shot).
Leading a healthy lifestyle includes maintaining
a healthy body weight. Exercising at a
moderate intensity for at least 150 minutes
per week is recommended. Talk to your doctor
before starting a new exercise regimen. Try to
eat a healthy diet that includes lots of plantbased foods.
