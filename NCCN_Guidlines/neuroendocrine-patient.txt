Endocrine system | Neuroendocrine system

A neuroendocrine tumor (NET) is a
rare type of tumor that can develop
anywhere in the body. A NET may grow
slowly or quickly and spread to other
parts of the body. This chapter reviews
the basics of how neuroendocrine
tumors form and how they are
diagnosed.

Endocrine system
Your endocrine system is a complex network
of glands and organs. It is often referred to as
the body’s messenger system because it uses
hormones to regulate your metabolism, energy
level, growth and development, and mood.
The endocrine system is made up of the
following:


Hypothalamus – located at the base of
the brain. It secretes hormones to control
water balance, sleep, temperature,
appetite, and blood pressure.



Pineal gland – located in the middle of
the brain. The pineal gland produces
melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that
helps the body know when it is time to
sleep.



Pituitary – located below the brain. Often
referred to as the body’s master gland,
this pea-sized gland controls the activity
of multiple hormone-secreting glands.



Thyroid and parathyroid – located in the
front of the neck. The thyroid maintains
your metabolism. The parathyroid helps
your body with calcium regulation.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Neuroendocrine Tumors, 2022



Thymus – located in the upper part of
the chest. The thymus makes white blood
cells (WBCs) that fight infections.



Adrenal gland – located on top of
each kidney. The adrenal glands help
to regulate blood pressure, metabolism,
and aspects of sexual development and
function.



Pancreas – located behind the stomach.
The pancreas helps with hormone
production and digestion.



Ovary – located on both sides of the
uterus, below the fallopian tubes. The
ovaries produce hormones (estrogen and
progesterone) and contain the egg cells
necessary for reproduction.



Testis – located in a pouch that hangs
outside the body. The testes produce
testosterone and sperm. Sperm is also
necessary for reproduction.

Neuroendocrine system
The neuroendocrine system refers to the
internal working of the body. The glands of
the endocrine system secrete hormones into
the bloodstream to maintain homeostasis
(stability) and regulate metabolism. Two
glands (hypothalamus and the pituitary gland)
are considered the control centers for much
of the neuroendocrine system. Their roles
are to direct hormones to specific locations
throughout the body.
The neuroendocrine system produces
neuroendocrine cells. Neuroendocrine cells
have traits of both nerve cells and hormoneproducing cells.

Neuroendocrine tumor | Stage

Neuroendocrine tumor

Stage

A neuroendocrine tumor (NET) is a rare type of
tumor that develops from neuroendocrine cells.
NETs can develop anywhere in the body. Most
often NETs are found in the lungs, pancreas,
rectum, appendix, and small intestine. A NET
may grow slowly or quickly and spread to other
parts of the body.

A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. Stage focuses on a few factors
such as the size of the tumor, where it is
located, and whether cancerous cells have
spread. A cancer stage is needed to plan and
monitor treatment.

Diagnosis and treatment of NETs depend
on the type of tumor, its location, whether it
produces excess hormones, how quickly it
spreads, and whether it has spread to other
parts of the body.

Because NETs can be found in different areas
of your body, different staging systems are
used depending on where they are found.
Some specialists use a staging system for
NETs similar to other cancer types. This
staging system was created by the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).

Symptoms

Many people with NETs do not have
symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they
vary based on the location of the tumor.

TNM scores

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging
system is used for certain NETs. The TNM
system is used to stage many soft tissue
sarcomas. In this system, the letters T, N, and
M describe different areas of cancer growth.
Based on cancer test results, your doctor will
assign a score or number to each letter. The
higher the number, the larger the tumor or the
more the cancer has spread. These scores will
be combined to assign the cancer a stage. A
TNM example might look like this: T2, N0, M0.

NET signs and symptoms may include:


Pain from a growing tumor



Lump felt somewhere on your body



Feeling unusually tired



Weight loss (without trying)



Nausea

If the tumor produces excess hormones, you
may also have the following symptoms:


Skin flushing



Diarrhea



Frequent urination



Increased thirst



Dizziness



Shakiness



Skin rash

T (tumor) - Size of the main (primary)
tumor

involvement is uncommon in most soft
tissue sarcomas.



M (metastasis) - If cancer has spread to
distant parts of the body or metastasized

NETs of the GI tract and pancreas have their
own staging systems based on location and
characteristics of the tumor.

Stage

NETs of the gastrointestinal tract



NETs of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can start
in the stomach, small intestine, appendix,
colon, or rectum. While staging for each of
these organs is slightly different, they all have
stages 1 through 4. The higher the stage, the
more advanced the cancer is, which may make
it more difficult to treat.

NETs of the appendix
 Stage 1: The tumor is less than or equal
to 2 cm wide and has not spread to any
lymph nodes.


Stage 2: The tumor is wider than 2 cm.
It may be growing into other tissue layers
around the appendix. It has not spread
to any lymph nodes or distant parts of
the body.



Stage 3: The tumor may have spread to
nearby lymph nodes, or may be growing
into the outermost layer of tissue of
the appendix. The tumor has not yet
metastasized to distant parts of the
body, but it may have spread to nearby
lymph nodes.



Stage 4: The cancer has spread to distant
parts of the body.

NETs of the stomach
 Stage 1: The tumor is less than or equal
to 1 cm wide. It has not spread to any
lymph nodes or distant parts of the body.


Stage 2: The tumor is larger than 1 cm
wide or has grown into other layers of
tissue.



Stage 3: The tumor has grown into the
outermost layer of the stomach, or into
nearby structures or organs. It may have
spread to lymph nodes, but not distant
parts of the body.



Stage 4: Cancer has spread to distant
parts of the body.

NETs of the colon and rectum
 Stage 1: The tumor is less than or equal
to 2 cm wide and has grown into deeper
layers of cells (affecting the lamina
propria or submucosa). The cancer has
not spread to nearby lymph nodes or
distant parts of the body.

NETs of the small intestine
 Stage 1: The tumor is less than or
equal to 1 cm wide. It has not spread
to any lymph nodes or outside the
small intestine.




Stage 2: The tumor is larger than 1 cm
wide and has begun to grow into other
layers of the small intestine. It has
not spread to lymph nodes or distant
body parts.
Stage 3: The tumor is bigger and affecting
nearby organs or the outermost covering
of the small intestine. It may have spread
to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread
to other parts of the body.

Neuroendocrine Tumors, 2022

Stage 4: The cancer has spread to distant
parts of the body.



Stage 2A: The tumor is greater than 2 cm
wide. The tumor has also grown into other
tissue layers of the colon or rectum.



Stage 2B: The tumor has grown into
one of the outer layers of the colon or
rectum. It has not yet spread to nearby
lymph nodes.



Stage 3A: The tumor has grown into
the outer layer of the intestine or nearby

organs. It has not spread to nearby
lymph nodes.




Stage 3B: The tumor has spread to
nearby lymph nodes. It has not yet
spread (metastasized) to distant parts
of the body.
Stage 4: The tumor has spread to distant
parts of the body.

NETs of the pancreas
 Stage 1: The tumor is less than 2 cm
across and only found in the pancreas.


Stage 2: The tumor is between 2 and 4
cm and still only found in the pancreas.



Stage 3: The tumor has grown into
nearby organs.



Stage 4: Cancer has spread to distant
parts of the body.



Stage 1: The tumor is small and has not
spread to nearby lymph nodes.



Stage 1A: The tumor is less than or equal
to 3 cm wide.



Stage 1B: The tumor is between 3 cm
and 4 cm wide.



Stage 2: The tumor is larger than 4 cm.
The tumor may or may not have spread to
nearby lymph nodes.



Stage 2A: The tumor is between 4 cm
and 5 cm. It has not spread to lymph
nodes.

Tumor sizes
NETs of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can start in the stomach, small intestine, appendix,
colon, or rectum. Tumors are often measured in centimeters (cm).

Stage 2B: The tumor is less than or equal
to 5 cm, and has spread to nearby lymph
nodes. Or, the tumor is larger than 5 cm
but has not spread to the lymph nodes.



Grade

Grade
Another factor used in staging is the tumor
grade. Grade describes how abnormal the
tumor cells look under a microscope and
how quickly these cells are likely to grow and
spread. The letter G stands for the grade. GX
means the grade can’t be determined, followed
by G1, G2, and G3. G3 is the highest grade.

Stage 3: The tumor may have spread to
the lymph nodes, but not to distant parts
of the body. Stage 3 tumors are difficult
to fully remove with surgery. This is
especially true if they have grown into the
heart or blood vessels.



Stage 4: The tumor has now spread to
the other lung or distant parts of the body,
such as the brain or liver.



Stage 4A: The tumor is both in the chest
and in the heart or lungs.



Stage 4B: The tumor has spread outside
of the chest and lungs to one or more
organs.

Grade also helps to describe how much cancer
cells look like healthy cells when viewed under
a microscope. This is referred to as degree of
differentiation.
There are 2 degrees of differentiation:
Well differentiated: Tumor cells are
described as looking like healthy cells.



Poorly differentiated: The tumor cells
do not look like healthy cells. Poorly
differentiated cells are also divided into
large-cell and small-cell type. This refers
to how the cells look under a microscope.

The tumor’s grade and differentiation help your
doctor predict how quickly the tumor will grow
and spread. In general, the lower the tumor’s
grade and degree of differentiation, the better
your outlook (prognosis).

Neuroendocrine
tumors develop from
cells that produce
hormones. This
means the tumor
can also produce
hormones.

Testing

Test results

Treatment planning starts with testing.
Testing is used to diagnose and plan
treatment for neuroendocrine tumors.
This chapter presents an overview of
the tests you might receive and what
to expect.

Create a medical binder

Test results

A medical binder or notebook is a great
way to organize all of your records in
one place.

Neuroendocrine tumors will be diagnosed
based on a series of test results. Your
diagnosis will determine your treatment plan.
It is important you understand what these
tests mean.

•

Make copies of blood tests, imaging
results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

•

Choose a binder that meets your
needs. Consider a zipper pocket to
include a pen, small calendar, and
insurance cards.

Keep these things in mind:


Bring someone with you to doctor visits,
if possible.



Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.

•

Create folders for insurance forms,
medical records, and tests results. You
can do the same on your computer.



Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about your specific disease.

•



Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on
your computer.

Use online patient portals to view
your test results and other records.
Download or print the records to add to
your binder.

•

Organize your binder in a way that
works for you. Add a section for
questions and to take notes.

•

Bring your medical binder to
appointments. You never know when
you might need it!



Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician
informed of changes to this list.

General health tests

General health tests
What is your family health
history?

Medical history

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Tell your doctor about any symptoms you
have. A medical or health history will help
determine which treatment is best for you.

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families—those who are related to you
through genes passed down from parent to
child. This information is called a family health
history. You can ask family members about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed. For relatives who have died, ask
about the cause and age of death.

Family history

Some cancers and other diseases can run in
families. Your doctor will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members about their health
issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes,
and at what age they were diagnosed.

Start by asking your parents, siblings, and
children. Next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and
uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents,
and grandchildren.
Write down what you learn about your family
history and share the information with your
health care provider.

Physical exam

During a physical exam, a health care provider
may:




Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat



Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched. Tell your doctor if you feel pain.



Some of the questions to ask include:

Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate

Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin. Tell your
doctor if you have felt any lumps or have
any pain.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Neuroendocrine Tumors, 2022

•

Do you have any chronic diseases, such
as heart disease or diabetes, or health
conditions such as high blood pressure or
high cholesterol?

•

Have you had any other diseases, such as
cancer or stroke?

•

How old were you when each of these
diseases and health conditions was
diagnosed?

•

What is our family’s ancestry—from what
countries did our ancestors originate?

Testing

Imaging tests

Imaging tests

by mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV).
The contrast is not permanent and will leave
the body in your urine immediately after the
test.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body. A radiologist, an expert in
interpreting test images, will write a report
and send this report to your doctor. Your test
results will be discussed with you.

Tell your doctors if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines,
such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and
prednisone (steroids), to avoid the effects of
those allergies. Contrast might not be used if
you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys
are not working well.

CT scan

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture.

MRI scan

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Contrast might be used. An
MRI may be used as an initial test, to check
treatment results, and to see if the cancer has
spread to other parts of the body.

In most cases, contrast will be used. Contrast
material is used to improve the pictures of the
inside of the body. Contrast materials are not
dyes, but substances that help enhance and
improve the images of several organs and
structures in the body. They are used to make
the pictures clearer. Contrast might be taken

CT scan
A CT scan uses x-rays
to take pictures of the
inside of the body. These
pictures help to show
where cancer activity is
located.

Imaging tests

PET scan

FDG PET/CT scan

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
help see cancer cells in the body. PET scans
are performed about an hour after the tracer
is injected. PET scans are combined with
CT or MRI scans (PET/CT or PET/MRI) to
determine where the cancer cells are located.
This combined test is considered to be more
accurate than either scan alone. There are
two types of PET scans that can be helpful for
patients with neuroendocrine tumors (FDGPET and SSTR-PET).

An FDG-PET scan uses
18-fluorodeoxyglucose as its tracer. This
scan shows how fast your tumor cells use up
a sugar called glucose. Active cancer cells
use sugar faster than normal cells. This will
make the cells look brighter in pictures. Many
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are not fastgrowing and not very bright on FDG-PET
scans. FDG-PET scans can help determine
if neuroendocrine tumors are becoming more
aggressive.

Transrectal ultrasound
A probe is used to take
pictures inside your body,
including the rectum and
prostate.

Testing

Imaging tests

SSTR-PET/CT scan

A somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist
is a protein found on the surface of cells
that bind to a hormone called somatostatin.
Somatostatin helps to control other hormones
in the body. SSTRs are found on many
different types of cells, but especially cells in
NETs. SSTR-PET uses a tracer that binds to
these SSTRs, and causes even small NETs to
be bright on PET images.

We want your
feedback!

SSTR-PET/MRI scan

An SSTR-PET/MRI scan is similar to SSTRPET/CT, but uses MRI instead of CT to
determine where the NETs are located. MRI
can provide better imaging of soft tissues
compared to CT.

Our goal is to provide helpful
and easy-to-understand
information on cancer.
Take our survey to let us
know what we got right and
what we could do better:

Ultrasound

An ultrasound (US) uses high-frequency
sound waves to form pictures of the inside of
the body. A probe will be pressed onto your
abdomen. This is similar to the sonogram used
for pregnancy. Ultrasound is painless and
does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as
needed. It can show small areas of cancer that
are near the surface of the body. Sometimes,
an ultrasound or CT is used to guide a biopsy.

NCCN.org/patients/feedback

Endorectal ultrasound
An endorectal ultrasound is used to look for
anything out of the ordinary in the rectum and
prostate. An endorectal ultrasound is also
referred to as ERUS, transrectal ultrasound,
and TRUS.

Testing

Blood and urine tests

Blood and urine tests

Biochemical tests

Biochemical tests measure substances like
hormones that may be present with a NET.
Symptoms may be seen when your body
makes too much of a hormone. Your doctor
may consider these tests if you may have
a NET or syndromes caused by a tumor.
For a list of NETs, where they are located,
symptoms, and tests needed, see Guide 1.

Blood and urine tests check for signs of
disease and how well the organs are working.
These tests are also used to look for signs of
hormone secretion or to see how well you are
responding to certain treatments. Abnormal
levels of certain chemicals found in the blood
or urine may be a sign that the neuroendocrine
tumor (NET) has spread to distant parts of
the body.

Urine tests

Urine tests look for signs of disease and
assess your general health. Abnormal results
may signal there’s a problem with your kidneys
or other organs. Abnormal results may be
caused by kidney cancer or other health
conditions. For a urine test, you will be asked
to fill a small container with urine. The urine
sample will be sent to a lab for testing.

Comprehensive metabolic panel

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is
a test that measures 14 different chemical
substances in your blood. A CMP provides
important information about how well your
kidneys and liver are working, among other
things. The test shows if the level of chemicals
is too low or too high. Abnormal levels are an
indication that there is an issue.

5-HIAA test

5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) is a
biomarker found in urine or blood that is used
to confirm whether certain types of carcinoid
tumor that secrete excess serotonin hormone
are present. A carcinoid tumor is a type of
NET that grows from neuroendocrine cells. A
5-HIAA urine test involves collecting a 24-hour
urine sample. It can also be tested in a sample
of blood. This test may also be used along
with scans to check if you are responding to
treatment.

Complete blood count

A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your
blood. Your doctor will want to know if you
have enough RBCs to carry oxygen throughout
your body, WBCs to fight infection, and PLTs to
control bleeding.

Biopsy | Scopes

Biopsy

EGD

An EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) is
used to look for digestive disorders. An EGD
refers to an endoscope inserted through your
esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (part
of your small intestine). It is an outpatient
procedure. This means you can go home the
same day. The procedure is estimated to take
approximately 30 to 60 minutes.

A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue
or group of cells for testing. It is an important
part of an accurate diagnosis. Your sample
should be reviewed by a pathologist who is
an expert in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine
tumors. This review is often referred to as
histology, histopathology, or hematopathology
review. The pathologist will note the overall
appearance and the size, shape, and type of
your cells. Tests will be done on the biopsied
cells.

Endoscopic ultrasound

An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a minimally
invasive procedure to look for gastrointestinal
(GI) and lung diseases. A special score uses
sound waves to provide images of your
digestive tract and chest.

Scopes
Endoscopy

Gastric biopsy

An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside
of the body is studied, and is used to test
for many diseases and conditions such as
anemia, bleeding, inflammation, diarrhea, or
cancers of the digestive system. It can also
be used to locate and/or diagnose a NET. An
endoscope (a flexible tube with a light and
camera attached to it) is used to view pictures
of your digestive tract on a color monitor.

A gastric biopsy refers to the removal of
stomach tissue for examination. During the
biopsy, a flexible tube is passed through
the mouth and down the esophagus to the
stomach. The tissue biopsy will be taken to a
laboratory to be tested for bacteria and other
organisms that can cause disease.

Gastric pH test

A gastric pH test measures if acid is present in
the stomach and can be helpful in workup of
some gastric NETs. The test involves placing a
thin tube into your esophagus. The tube device
measures your stomach acid level (pH level).

Colonoscopy

A colonoscopy is used to check for disease
of the colon such as carcinoid tumor or colon
cancer. A colonoscopy refers to a scope
inserted through the anus into the large
intestine. The large intestine is also known as
the colon. A camera on the scope is used to
view the colon and check for abnormal areas
of concern.

Testing

Genetic tests

Genetic tests
Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup). The goal is to look for
gene mutations inherited from your biological
parents, called germline mutations. Some
mutations can put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. You can pass these
germline mutations on to your children.
Also, other family members may have these
mutations.

Genetic counseling
can help you consider
the risks, benefits,
and limitations of
genetic testing. It
involves a review of
your family history
for cancer risk.

Tell your doctor if you have a family history of
cancer or endocrine tumors. Depending on
your family history or other features of your
cancer, your health care provider might refer
you for hereditary genetic testing to learn more
about inherited risks for cancer. You may meet
with a genetic counselor to discuss genetic
testing options and/or to explain your test
results.

Hereditary syndromes closely related to
neuroendocrine tumors include:

Hereditary conditions

Certain genetic (inherited) conditions may
increase your risk for developing certain
tumors. A genetic risk assessment by a genetic
counselor or other health care provider can
provide information about the likelihood you
have a cancer risk factor and whether you
may benefit from genetic testing, additional
screening, or preventive interventions.
Depending on the genetic risk assessment,
you may choose to undergo genetic testing.

Treatment options

Surgery

Surgery
Surgery is the primary treatment for NETs
with limited or no spread. Primary treatment
refers to the main treatment used to get rid of
cancer in the body. The method and extent
of surgery depends on where the tumor is
located and how far the disease has spread.
Treatment will be based on whether the tumor
can be removed by surgery (resectable) or not
(unresectable).

Get to know your
care team and help
them get to
know you.

Surgery may be considered even if the tumor
cannot be completely removed (tumor in liver).
Work with your treatment team to determine if
surgery is right for you.

Endoscopic resection

During this procedure, any visible tumors
are removed, but the lymph nodes and
surrounding tissues are typically left
untouched.

An endoscopic resection is where an
endoscopic approach is used to remove
abnormal tissues (lesions) from the
gastrointestinal (GI) or lung tract. During the
procedure, a flexible tube (endoscope) is
passed down the esophagus, stomach, upper
part of the small intestine (duodenum), or
lung. The tube may be guided up through the
anus to remove lesions from the colon. This
procedure is used to remove tumors without
surgery. It is also referred to as an endoscopic
mucosal resection (EMR).

Bowel resection with regional
lymphadenectomy

Bowel resection refers to a surgical procedure
that removes diseased or damaged tissue
or part of an organ. It is also referred to as a
partial colectomy. A regional lymphadenectomy
refers to surgery to remove lymph nodes near
the tumor.

Local excision

Regional lymphadenectomy

A local excision is a surgical procedure
used to treat NETs from various sites of the
hepatopancreatic duct (ampullary adenomas),
small neuroendocrine tumors that develop
in the ampulla of Vater (where your bile duct
and pancreatic duct join and empty into your
small intestine), and certain noncancerous
conditions, such as inflammatory stenosis.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Neuroendocrine Tumors, 2022

A regional lymphadenectomy is a surgical
procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes
in the tumor area. After the lymph nodes are
removed a sample of tissue is checked under
a microscope for signs of cancer. It is also
called a lymph node dissection.

Treatment options

Surgery

Whipple procedure

A Whipple procedure can be open or minimally
invasive. It requires a great deal of skill. Blood
vessels might have to be removed or pieces
cut out and sewn back together. Parts of
organs might have to be removed and sewn
back together. All cancer must be removed to
achieve a negative margin resection (R0). This
might not be possible based on the type and
stage of cancer.

If the tumor is in the head of your pancreas,
you will have a pancreaticoduodenectomy
(Whipple procedure). A Whipple procedure
is surgery that removes the head of the
pancreas, the gallbladder, duodenum (first part
of the small intestine), part of the bile duct, and
often part of the stomach.
Lymph nodes near your pancreas will be
removed and tested. Once the cancer has
been removed, your surgeons will reconnect
your organs so you can digest food. Possible
life-threatening complications of this surgery
are infection, bleeding, pancreatic leaks, and
fistulas (an opening between organs).

Simple appendectomy

An appendectomy is a surgical procedure
to remove the appendix. The appendix is a
small tube attached to the large intestine. An
appendectomy is necessary when an infection
has caused the appendix to become inflamed
and swollen. This is often referred to as
appendicitis. Most people recover quickly and
without complications from this surgery.

Treatment options

Chemotherapy | Chemoradiation

Right hemicolectomy

Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment
days followed by days of rest. This allows
the body to recover before the next cycle of
chemotherapy. The length of treatment and
rest days vary based on the chemotherapy
drugs used.

A hemicolectomy refers to a surgical procedure
that removes part of your large intestine called
the colon. Once the colon is removed, the
remaining parts of the intestine are joined
together. The procedure has little to no impact
on your digestion. That is, your colon can be
partially removed without affecting the way
your digestive system works.

Chemotherapy is commonly used for highgrade NETs, poorly differentiated NETs, and
NETs of certain tumors (pancreatic).

Chemotherapy

Chemoradiation

Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
some normal cells. Chemotherapy drugs work
in different ways to kill abnormal cells or to
stop new ones from being made. Your doctor
may use more than one chemotherapy drug. It
is referred to as a combination regimen when
two or more chemotherapy drugs are used.

Chemoradiation refers to a treatment that
combines a lower-dose chemotherapy with
radiation therapy (RT). These treatments can
be given at the same time or be staggered.

Immunotherapy | Somatostatin analogs

Immunotherapy

Somatostatin analogs

Immunotherapy increases the activity of your
own immune system. The immune system is
the body’s natural defense against infection
and disease. By targeting the immune system,
immunotherapy improves your body’s ability to
find and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy
can be given alone or with other types of
treatment.

Somatostatin analogs are drugs used to
slow down or stop hormone production from
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) to reduce
symptoms such as diarrhea and flushing and
to control tumor growth. Somatostatin analogs
are made to have long-lasting activity in the
body.
Somatostatin analogs used to treat NETs
include:

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT)
refers to a molecular targeted therapy. If your
NETs progress on somatostatin analogs,
a targeted treatment using a somatostatin
analog attached to a therapeutic radioactive
molecule (177Lu-dotatate, Lutathera) can
be considered. The molecule attaches to the
somatostatin receptors of the NET, which
allows a high dose of radiation to be delivered
directly to the tumor. Typically, this involves a
series of 4 treatments given 8 weeks apart.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop the action
of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/
or survive.

Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
diseases need to be studied in people. If
found to be safe and effective in a clinical
trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach
may be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.


Phase I trials study the dose, safety, and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.



Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.



Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Neuroendocrine Tumors, 2022

Start the conversation

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Frequently asked questions

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

General supportive care

General supportive care

Diarrhea

Supportive care is health care that relieves
symptoms and improves quality of life. It might
include pain relief (palliative care), emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you
are feeling and about any side effects. Best
supportive care, supportive care, and palliative
care are often used interchangeably.

Distress

Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how
to manage diarrhea and may recommend
medicines to stop the diarrhea. It is important
to drink lots of fluids. Changes to your diet
might help.

Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt.

Blocked stomach

A tumor in the pancreas may also grow large
enough to block food from passing out of your
stomach through the first part of the small
intestine (duodenum). This blockage can
cause pain, vomiting, weight loss, and other
problems. Treatments for a blocked stomach
include removing the tumor (if possible),
a stent, a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy) tube, or a stomach-duodenum
bypass (gastrojejunostomy).

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping problems
are common in cancer. Talk to your doctor and
with those whom you feel most comfortable
about how you are feeling. There are services
and people who can help you. Support and
counseling services are available.

Diabetes

Diabetes is a condition where the amount of
glucose (a type of sugar) in your blood is too
high. The amount of glucose in your blood is
called your blood sugar level or blood glucose
level. If you have diabetes or early-onset
diabetes, a pancreatic tumor can change how
the diabetes is managed. Diabetes can also
happen when part or all of your pancreas is
removed. Each type of diabetes is different
and treated differently.

Fatigue

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy that cannot be
easily explained. Let your care team know
how you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in
the way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating
a balanced diet, exercise, yoga, and massage
therapy can help. You might be referred to a
nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue.

rare type of cancer that starts in part of
your digestive system. The digestive
system includes the stomach, small
intestine, colon, and rectum. This
chapter reviews the different testing and
treatment options.

and processing food waste. The most common
place to find NETs in the GI tract is in the small
intestine or rectum. However, they can also
start in the stomach, appendix, colon, and
other areas of the GI tract. A NET of the GI
tract is also called a carcinoid tumor.
Recommended testing includes:

Additional testing may include:

Diagnosis
A neuroendocrine tumor (NET) starts in
the specialized cells of the neuroendocrine
system. One of the most common places to
find a NET is in the GI tract, also called the
digestive system. The GI tract starts at the
mouth/esophagus and ends at the anus. Main
functions include digesting food and liquid,

Gastrointestinal tract
The GI tract, also known as

farther such as the liver.

Duodenum
Treatment for NETs in the duodenum (first
part of the small intestine) is broken up into 3
categories:

The following terms are used to describe the
location of NETs:




Locoregional disease is the spread of
cancer to places near the primary tumor.
The disease has not spread far within
the body.
Metastatic disease is the spread of
cancer from the primary tumor to a new
(often distant) site in the body.

Metastatic disease

Non-functioning NET

A non-functioning NET is a tumor that does not
make hormones, or makes hormones that do
not cause symptoms.

Jejunum, ileum, and colon

Primary treatment for a non-functioning NET
includes one of the following:

If it is determined that you have locoregional
disease, you will be treated with a bowel
resection with removal of regional lymph
nodes.
Your doctor may remove some lymph nodes
and check the blood vessels in the area for
cancer. Sometimes surgery is not an option for
disease that has spread to other parts of the
body. If your disease has spread, you may be
offered a drug treatment instead of surgery or
a combination of both. Work with your doctor
and care team to develop the best course of
treatment for your situation.



Endoscopic resection



Local excision (transduodenal) and a
regional lymphadenectomy



Pancreatoduodenectomy

After primary treatment, your doctor will
determine whether or not the tumor is invasive.
An invasive tumor means the tumor has
spread into muscle.
If the tumor is noninvasive, you will receive
routine endoscopic surveillance.

You will begin surveillance soon after surgery.
Surveillance refers to being tested on a regular
basis. Your doctors will watch for tumor growth,
and may start treatment later if necessary. For
more information on surveillance tests, see

If the tumor is invasive or you receive a
pancreatoduodenectomy, you will be treated
according to a specific surveillance schedule.

Duodenal gastrinoma

If the tumor is invasive or you receive a

according to a specific surveillance schedule.

A duodenal gastrinoma is a gastrin-secreting
tumor. Gastrin is a hormone that helps your
stomach produce acid. A gastrinoma secretes
large amounts of gastrin, which causes your
stomach to produce too much acid and may
cause a burning sensation.

Appendix
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the
appendix are treated based on the size of the
tumor as well as tumor penetration (how far it
has spread).

After primary treatment, your doctor will

An invasive tumor means the tumor has
spread into muscle.

If you have a tumor that is 2 centimeters
(cm) or smaller, your appendix will be
removed through a procedure called a simple
appendectomy. No surveillance is needed.

If the tumor is noninvasive, you will receive
routine endoscopic surveillance.

Laparoscopic incisions

An appendectomy is the surgical
removal of the appendix.

NETs of the GI tract

Rectum

If the tumor is larger than 2 cm, you had an
incomplete resection, or there were positive
nodes or margins found, your doctor will
check for the extent of disease. A CT or MRI
of the abdomen is recommended. An SSTRPET/CT, or SSTR-PET/MR is possible. After
this additional testing, your doctor may ask
you to consider a right hemicolectomy. A
hemicolectomy removes the right side of your
colon.

Treatment for rectal NETs is broken up
by size. You might have a rectal MRI or
endorectal ultrasound to measure the tumor.
Smaller tumors are removed by surgery. Next
treatment options depend on if there is cancer
remaining in the margins. A margin refers to no
cancer cells found at the edge of the tissue. If
cancer remains in the margin, you may require
further treatment.
If there are no cancer cells found in the
margin, no other treatment is needed.

For surveillance after treatment, see Guide 3.
For treatment of metastatic disease, see

If there are unknown margins, you will be
treated based on the grade for your disease.
For low grade (G1), will receive further testing
by endoscope at 6 to 12 months to determine
disease status. If the tests results are negative,
no additional treatment is needed. If the test
results are positive, you will be treated similar
to other rectal tumors. See Guide 2.

Guide 4.

Rectum
Rectal NETs need different treatments than
other more common types of bowel cancer.
Rectal NETs are often small lesions that can
be treated with an endoscopic resection.
However, if there is lymph node metastasis,
more invasive surgery may be needed.

If your disease is an intermediate grade (G2),
you will be treated similar to other rectal
tumors. See Guide 2.

Other rectal tumors: T2 to T4
• Less than 1 cm: No follow-up required
• 1 cm through 2 cm: Endoscopy with rectal

resection.
Surveillance will be as follows:


If your tumor was less than 1 cm, there
will be no follow-up required.

Primary treatment for tumors less than 2 cm is
a resection of the tumor. Surveillance activities
are outlined in Guide 2.
If your tumor is greater than 2 cm, you will be
treated with one of the following:

If your tumor is T2 through T4 (tumor has
reached the muscularis propria or beyond,
or is greater than 2 cm), you will receive
additional testing before you begin treatment.

NETs of the stomach are rare. Tumors start in
the neuroendocrine cells of the stomach.
Additional testing will be used to determine
your type of stomach (gastric) NET.

Gastric pH (if appropriate)

Primary treatment for Type 2 depends on
whether or not the primary gastrinoma can be
resected.

Once your type has been identified, you
may receive additional testing to determine
treatment options.

If the primary gastrinoma can be resected,
your doctor will determine whether or not the
tumor is invasive. An invasive tumor means it
has spread into muscle.

Type 1

If you are Type 1/hypergastrinemic, you may
receive the following tests:


Vitamin B12 level



Baseline gastrin measurement



Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)

If the tumor is noninvasive, you will receive
routine endoscopic surveillance.
If the tumor is invasive, you will be treated
according to a specific surveillance schedule.

See Guide 3.

If the primary gastrinoma cannot be resected,
you may be treated with the following:

Primary treatment for Type 1 is endoscopic
resection of large or bleeding/symptomcausing tumors.
After treatment, you should expect to receive
endoscopic surveillance and endoscopic
resection of prominent tumors every 2 to 3
years (or as needed).

Neuroendocrine tumors of the
gastrointestinal tract (GI NETs) are a rare
type of cancer that start in part of your
digestive system.



The GI tract starts at the mouth/
esophagus and ends at the anus. Main
functions include digesting food and
liquid, and processing food waste.



Treatment options are based on the
location of the NET and if it has spread to
other areas near the tumor, such as the
lymph nodes, or farther such as the liver.



Treatment for NETs in the duodenum (first
part of the small intestine) are broken up

Locoregional disease

If your tumor cannot be removed by surgery,

Surgery is the primary treatment option for
stage 1 and 2 thymus tumors.

see Guide 6.

Treatment for stage 3A and 3B is broken up by
whether the tumor can be surgically removed
(resectable).

Metastatic disease

Metastatic disease refers to cancer that has
spread from the primary tumor site to a distant
part of the body. If you are suspected of
having metastatic (advanced) disease, you will
receive more testing to confirm.

If your tumor can be surgically removed, and
no other cancer cells are found around the
tumor’s margins, you should expect followup tests. For a list of surveillance tests, see

Guide 5.

For more information on testing and treatment
of metastatic disease, see Guide 7.

If your tumor can be surgically removed,
but the resection is incomplete or there are
positive margins found after surgery, then
you might have observation. If it the tumor
is intermediate grade (atypical carcinoid),
then radiation therapy might be given with or

Diagnosis

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the lungs
are also referred to as lung carcinoid tumors.
NET lung tumors often develop in the major
bronchi (large tubes that lead air from the
windpipe into the lungs).
There are 4 types of pulmonary (in the lungs)
NETs:


Typical carcinoids (low grade) – slow
growing and less likely to spread beyond
the lungs



Atypical carcinoids (intermediate grade) –
rarer and grow more rapidly than typical
tumors



Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)

Bynfezia Pen), or lanreotide (Somatuline
Depot). These drugs are referred to as
somatostatin analogs. Somatostatin analogs
are drugs used to slow down or stop hormone
production.

With observation, you should expect to receive
a chest CT (without contrast) every 12 to 24
months to monitor the disease.

With observation, you should expect to have
a chest CT with contrast and abdominal/pelvic

NETs of the pancreas

Diagnosis

A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
(PNET) is a type of cancer that forms
tumors in the pancreas. There is more
than one type of PNET.



A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET)
is a type of cancer that forms tumors in the
pancreas. Endocrine cells of the pancreas
make hormones. These are released directly
into the bloodstream. PNETs are either
functional (produce hormones) or, more
commonly, nonfunctional (do not produce
hormones).

Diagnosis
The pancreas is a large gland found in your
abdomen. The pancreas lies behind the
stomach and across the spine. The pancreas
has 3 parts: the head, the body, and the tail.

There are 4 types of functional pancreas NETs:

The pancreas does 2 important things:




It makes hormones (such as insulin and
glucagon) that control the amount of
sugar (glucose) in your blood. This helps
your body use and store energy from
food.

Parts of the Pancreas
The pancreas consists of
a wide end called the head
(includes neck and uncinate
process), a middle part called
the body, and a narrow end
called the tail.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Neuroendocrine Tumors, 2022

It makes powerful substances called
pancreatic enzymes that help digest food
in your small intestine.

55

Gastrinoma – This type of tumor
makes too much gastrin. Gastrin is a
hormone that causes acid production in
the stomach. Too much stomach acid
can cause severe ulcers (referred to as
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome).

6

NETs of the pancreas



Glucagonoma – This type of tumor
makes too much glucagon. Glucagon is a
hormone that increases glucose (sugar)
levels in the blood. Too much blood
glucose is called hyperglycemia.





Treatment

Treatment
Treatment for PNETs is based on the following:
Location - whether the cancer is found in one
or multiple areas of the pancreas, and whether
it is in the tail or head of the pancreas (more
complicated surgery to remove).

Insulinoma - This type of tumor makes
too much insulin, which can rapidly lower
blood sugar (referred to as hypoglycemia
or low blood sugar). Insulinomas are
typically noncancerous.

Metastases – whether the cancer has spread
to lymph nodes or other parts of the body such
as the liver, lung, peritoneum, or bone.

VIPoma – This type of tumor starts in
the cells of the pancreas that make
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIP
is a hormone that helps move water into
the intestines. Too much VIP can cause
chronic, watery diarrhea. This is referred
to as Verner-Morrison syndrome.

Standard treatment for PNETs includes:

PNETs need different treatment than the
more common type of pancreatic cancer.

Duodenotomy

A duodenotomy refers to an incision of the
duodenum.

Pancreatoduodenectomy

Pancreatoduodenectomy refers to surgery that
removes the head of the pancreas, gallbladder,
duodenum (first part of the small intestine),
part of the bile duct, nearby lymph nodes, and
often part of the stomach. This is known as a
Whipple procedure. This surgery can be open
or minimally invasive.

Pancreatectomy

There are 2 types of pancreatectomy:


Distal pancreatectomy – refers to
surgery that removes the body and
tail of the pancreas, and sometimes
the entire spleen (splenectomy). The
left adrenal gland might also be
removed. This surgery can be open or
minimally invasive.



Total pancreatectomy – refers to surgery
that removes the whole pancreas, part of
the small intestine, part of the stomach,
the common bile duct, the gallbladder,
the spleen, and nearby lymph nodes.
It is usually done as open surgery.

Non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors (PNETs) are caused by abnormal
growth and reproduction of neuroendocrine
cells in the pancreas. Nonfunctioning PNETs
often do not show any symptoms related to
hormones.
Symptoms of a nonfunctioning PNET
may include:

Peripancreatic lymphadenectomy

A peripancreatic lymphadenectomy refers to a
surgical procedure that removes lymph nodes
and obtains a tissue sample to look for cancer.

Gastrinoma

Gastrinoma

Locoregional disease

Locoregional disease is the spread of cancer
to places near the primary tumor. The cancer
has not spread to distant parts of the body.

Gastrinoma refers to a rare tumor that is
found in neuroendocrine cells (usually in the
duodenum or head of pancreas). Gastrinomas
make too much gastrin. Gastrin helps your
body control the amount of acid in your
stomach and helps to digest food. Too much
acid can cause ulcers in your stomach or
duodenum.

If the tumor is equal to or smaller than 2
centimeters (cm), you will receive one of the
following treatment options:


Observation (in select cases)



Removal of the tumor (enucleation) or
without regional lymphadenectomy



Resection with or without regional
lymphadenectomy



Abdominal pain



Heartburn

If the tumor is larger than 2 cm, invasive, or
node positive (cancer cells in lymph nodes),
you will be treated based on the part of the
pancreas affected:



Nausea



Diarrhea



Blood in vomit or feces





Symptoms of gastrinoma may include:

Recommended testing to diagnosis gastrinoma
includes:

For tumors in the pancreas head, you will
be treated with a pancreatoduodenectomy
and a regional lymphadenectomy.
For tumors in the distal part of the

Insulinoma

Locoregional disease

Primary treatment for locoregional insulinoma
starts by getting your glucose (sugar) levels
stable with a change in diet and/or diazoxide
(Proglycem) and/or everolimus (Afinitor).

Insulinoma refers to a tumor in your pancreas.
This type of tumor makes too much insulin
(more than your body can use). Insulinomas
are known to cause hypoglycemia (low blood
sugar).

Further treatment is determined by the tumor
type and location:

Symptoms of insulinoma may include:


Confusion



Sweating



Weakness



Rapid heartbeat



For surface tumors or those growing
outward (exophytic), you will receive a
tumor enucleation. A tumor enucleation
is a procedure where tumor cells are
removed, but the pancreas is left intact.



For deeper or invasive tumors close to
the main pancreatic duct in the head
of the pancreas, you will receive a
pancreatoduodenectomy.



For deeper or invasive tumors close to
the main pancreatic duct in the distal part
of the pancreas, you will receive a distal
pancreatectomy. The entire spleen will not
be removed. Minimally invasive surgery
will be considered.

Recommended testing for insulinoma includes:

A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
(PNET) is a type of cancer that forms
tumors in the pancreas. PNETs are either
functional (produce hormones) or, more

NETs of unknown primary

Well-differentiated grade 3 NET

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of unknown
primary refer to tumors that do not have a
known original tumor site. If the original tumor
site cannot be identified, the tumor will be
treated as a tumor of unknown primary.

A grade 3, well-differentiated NET is
considered high grade. This means the cells of
the tumor are fast growing. High-grade tumors
are more likely to spread to other areas of the
body.

Testing

Pituitary

For a tumor in the pituitary gland, you might
have the following tests:

Testing for MEN1 is specific to where the
tumor is found, such as the parathyroid glands,
pancreas, pituitary gland, lungs, or thymus
gland. However, anyone with suspected MEN1
should receive genetic counseling and testing
for inherited genetic conditions.



Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-OH
vitamin D



Imaging (neck ultrasound, parathyroid
sestamibi with SPECT scan, or 4D-CT)



Abdominal with or without pelvic
multiphasic CT or MRI (recommended)



Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)



Somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-PET/CT or
SSTR-PET/MRI

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Neuroendocrine Tumors, 2022



Chest CT with contrast and abdominal/
pelvic multiphasic CT or MRI



Biochemical tests

Treatment for MEN1 is based on tumor
location.

Parathyroid glands

For a tumor in the pancreas, also referred to
as PanNET, you might have the following tests:
Biochemical tests (recommended)

Biochemical tests

Treatment

Pancreas





For a tumor in the thymus or lungs, you might
have the following tests:

The parathyroid glands are 4 pea-sized
organs found in the neck. For a tumor in
the parathyroid glands, you might have the
following tests:
Serum calcium

Pituitary or sella MRI with contrast

Bronchial/thymic

Parathyroid glands





If a tumor is found in the parathyroid glands,
you will be treated with one of the following:

74



Subtotal parathyroidectomy.
Cryopreservation of parathyroids and
thymectomy might also be done.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1

Surveillance | Key points

Key points

Pancreas

If a tumor is found in your pancreas, you will
be treated with one or more of the following:


Observation



Enucleation with or without regional
lymphadenectomy



Resection pancreatectomy with or without
regional lymphadenectomy



Pancreatoduodenectomy with regional
lymphadenectomy (if the tumor is in the
head of the pancreas)



Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy
and regional lymphadenectomy (if the
tumor is in the distal part of the pancreas)



Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1
(MEN1), is a rare, inherited condition that
causes tumors in the endocrine glands
and parts of the small intestine and
stomach.



In MEN1, your endocrine glands
(parathyroids, pancreas, and pituitary)
grow tumors that create excessive
amounts of hormones.



Testing and treatment for MEN1 is based
on where the tumor is located, such as
the parathyroid glands, pancreas, pituitary
gland, lungs, or thymus.



Anyone with suspected MEN1 should
receive genetic counseling and testing for
inherited genetic conditions.



Surveillance tests are done at specific
times after treatment to check if the
cancer has returned. These tests can
help find cancer early so you can start
treatment again, if needed.

Pituitary gland

Treatment for an adrenal tumor located in the
pituitary gland will begin with a referral to an
endocrinologist for more testing.

Bronchial/thymic

Treatment for tumors of the lungs and thymus
can be found in Chapter 5: Pulmonary NETs.

Surveillance
Surveillance tests are done at specific times
after treatment to check if the cancer has
returned. These tests can help find cancer
early so you can start treatment again, if
needed. Surveillance tests will likely include
blood and imaging tests.

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice | Questions to ask

It’s important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your doctor.

your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

Second opinion

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school
or work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Support groups

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, check out the websites listed in
this book.

Questions to ask your doctors

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
If you take the time to build a relationship with
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Neuroendocrine Tumors, 2022

Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment.
