About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian,
Pancreatic, and Prostate, Version 2.2025 – November 7, 2024

Hereditary cancers aren't very
different from non-hereditary
cancers. It's more the pattern
of how they occur in your
family that makes them
different. Hereditary cancers
often develop earlier and affect
multiple relatives on the same
side of the family.

1 About genetic testing » What causes hereditary cancers?

What causes hereditary
cancers?

Why you should read
this book

Hereditary cancers are caused by inherited
variants (differences) in specific genes.
Together these genes are called cancer
predisposition (or cancer susceptibility) genes.

Making decisions about cancer care
can be stressful. You may need to make
tough decisions under pressure about
complex choices.

Gene variants you are born with are called
germline. They are part of the DNA of every
cell in your body. In addition to your DNA, your
risk for cancer is based on your personal and
family health history.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients are
trusted by patients and providers.
They clearly explain current care
recommendations made by respected
experts in the field. Recommendations
are based on the latest research and
practices at leading cancer centers.

What is penetrance?
In someone with a gene variant that increases
the risk of a health problem, penetrance
describes how likely they are to develop
symptoms or features of the problem. For
example, 100% penetrance means that
everyone with that variant will develop the
problem if they live long enough. This is very
rare.

Cancer care is not the same for
everyone. By following expert
recommendations for your situation,
you are more likely to improve your
care and have better outcomes as a
result. Use this book as your guide to
find the information you need to make
important decisions.

Cancer predisposition genes are described as
low-, moderate-, or high-penetrance. Cancercausing variants in high-penetrance genes
are generally more likely to result in a cancer
diagnosis than variants in low- or moderatepenetrance genes. But other factors also affect
how likely you are to develop cancer, including
your age, family history, environment, and
lifestyle.

provider will explain the benefits, risks, and
limitations of genetic testing for cancer risk.

testing, and what to expect after a
positive result.

Your health history

Determining your risk for hereditary cancer and
learning about genetic testing involves 3 steps:

Counseling before any testing is ordered



Choosing the best test(s) for you



Counseling when your results are ready

Your past and current health is a key factor in
determining your risk of hereditary cancer. If
you've been diagnosed with any cancers, your
genetics provider will ask about:

Ideally, a health care professional trained in
cancer genetics will be involved at each stage.
This might be a genetic counselor, clinical
geneticist, oncologist, oncology nurse, or other
health care provider.

Whether you've had any surgeries to lower
your risk of developing cancer is also
important to share. Examples include risk-

are at increased risk of founder variants,
including BRCA1/2 variants.

Prior hematopoietic cell transplant
If you’ve had an allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT) to treat blood cancer, your
genetic testing results could reflect the DNA of
the stem cell donor when using blood, saliva,
or a cheek swab. To make sure your DNA (and
not your donor's) is extracted, your provider
may remove a small piece of your skin or other
tissue for testing.

Your provider is also likely to ask about
hormonal factors that may affect your risk,
such as:





your pregnancy history
whether you've used birth control pills or
other hormonal birth control
whether you've received menopausal
hormone therapy

Your family health history
Your testing provider will collect detailed
information about the health of your family
members.
Whether you have any close relatives with
cancer is especially important. Close blood
relatives include first-, second-, and thirddegree relatives on each side of your family.
See the chart on the next page for details.
The type(s) of cancer your relatives were
diagnosed with, their age at diagnosis, and the
cancer laterality is also important. In paired
organs, like the breasts and ovaries, laterality
describes which of the paired organ(s) have
cancer.
They will also ask about your ethnicity.
Founder variants are cancer-causing variants
found in a specific group of people that can be
traced back to common ancestors. People of
Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and other groups

How much does testing cost?

Other things to discuss

Ask your provider about the cost of genetic
testing. Many insurance companies will cover
the cost if a health care provider confirms it's
needed for your health care. In the United
States, most people can get genetic testing for
$250 or less out-of-pocket, depending on the
number of genes tested and other factors.

2 The genetic testing process » Choosing the best test(s) for you

Choosing the best test(s)
for you
Genetic testing is often performed using nextgeneration sequencing (NGS). Also called a
multi-gene panel, NGS analyzes entire sets of
cancer predisposition genes at the same time.
Multi-gene panels may include both moderateand high-penetrance genes.

At-home genetic tests
Genetic testing offered by companies
that provide ancestry and health
information, like 23andMe, is called
recreational testing. Some downsides of
these tests include:

To be tested, you will typically provide a
sample of blood or saliva (spit). The sample
is sent to a lab to check for gene variants that
cause hereditary cancers and syndromes.
Other types of samples may be used to obtain
your DNA if needed. Testing can be performed
on a sample of your cheek cells (buccal
smear), skin, hair, or nails.

•

They only check for variants linked
with a few cancers

•

They don’t consider your family
history

•

Results can be inaccurate

If you had a positive result from a
recreational test, discuss the result with a
health care provider. You may need to do
another genetic test to confirm the results
before using them for your health care.
More comprehensive at-home tests
are available through companies like
Invitae and Color Genomics. While
these typically include the services of
a genetic counselor, they often provide
only limited opportunity to discuss and
understand the significance of a gene
test result.

2 The genetic testing process » If results are positive

If results are positive

providers offer easy-to-understand materials
and resources you can use to notify your
family about your results and their risk.

After testing, your genetics provider will explain
your results and what they mean for your
health and cancer risk.

Referral to a genetics provider

A positive result means that a pathogenic
(cancer-causing) or a likely pathogenic variant
was found in 1 or more of the genes included
in the testing panel. Seeing a genetics provider
is recommended for positive results.

If your testing location doesn't have the
resources for pre-test counseling or post-test
care, ask to be referred to a genetics provider.
Seeing a genetics provider is also
recommended for a positive result, and for a
complex result that needs expert interpretation
and management.

For those who test positive and don't have a
cancer diagnosis, the next step is discussing
options for managing your cancer risk with
your provider. This could involve more frequent
screening, risk-reducing medicines, or riskreducing surgery.

Re-consultation about your risk
Over time, it may be helpful to have a followup visit with a genetics professional or other
health care provider who is familiar with
inherited cancer risk.

Some medical centers include specialized
care and screening services for people with a
positive genetic testing result. If available, your
provider may refer you to these services. Ask
your provider about cancer prevention clinics,
hereditary cancer support or advocacy groups,
and any available research studies.

This visit allows you to check in with your
provider about your cancer screening strategy.
They may suggest changes based on the
latest research, or if any new cancers have
been diagnosed in your family. You can also
discuss any newer options for genetic testing.

If you are being treated for cancer, a positive
result may affect your cancer care. It may also
affect the clinical trials you are eligible for.

And if your life circumstances have changed,
this is an opportunity to revisit earlier decisions
about risk-reducing surgery, and other
screening and prevention choices.

Sharing your results
To the extent possible, do your best to
share your results with your biological family
members. They may be at increased risk as
well and can benefit from risk assessment and
possibly testing.

How often you should have follow-up depends
on your age, reproductive planning, other
health problems, risk-reducing surgeries, and
other risk factors.

It's helpful if you provide them with a copy
of your results that they can share with their
doctors and genetics professional. Some

Family planning

can be tested for hereditary cancer-causing
variants. This is called pre-implantation genetic
testing (PGT). If desired, only embryos not
carrying the variant(s) can be transferred to the
uterus.

If you are of reproductive age, your provider
will explain what a positive genetic testing
result could mean for starting or growing your
family.

Couples can also choose to use eggs, sperm,
or embryos from a donor for IVF.

Some couples who have or carry genetic
disorders choose to conceive naturally.
Between the 10th and 14th weeks of
pregnancy, the baby can be tested for
cancer-causing variants using chorionic
villus sampling (CVS). This is called prenatal
diagnosis. Depending on the results, the
parents may make difficult decisions regarding
pregnancy management.
Another option for couples who have or carry
genetic disorders is in vitro fertilization (IVF).
In IVF, eggs are fertilized with sperm in a lab
to create embryos. The embryos are implanted
into the uterus or frozen for future use. Before
being transferred to the uterus, the embryos

Pre-implantation genetic
testing (PGT)
Embryos created through IVF
can be tested for a hereditary
cancer risk variant known to
be carried by the egg or sperm
donor. If desired, only embryos
not carrying the variant can be
transferred to the uterus.

2 The genetic testing process » Other possible results

Other possible results

Even though you tested negative, you may
benefit from increased cancer screening
and risk-reducing measures based on your
family history. Some medical centers include
specialized high-risk clinics that offer this type
of family history-based screening.

Other possible results of genetic testing are
described next.
A negative result means that you don't carry a
pathogenic variant in the cancer-predisposing
genes included in the testing panel. A
negative result is either a true negative or an
uninformative negative.

Your family members may benefit from genetic
testing, both to learn their own cancer risk and
to contribute data about your family's overall
cancer risk.

True negative results

Over time, you may be a candidate for
additional genetic testing due to new family
history data and advances in testing.

If a cancer-causing variant runs in your
family and you don't carry it, it's called a true
negative. This is a reassuring result.

Variant of uncertain significance

Keep in mind that you may still be at higher
risk than average based on your personal and
family history. You may still be at risk for any of
the following reasons:






A variant of uncertain significance (VUS) is a
genetic variant for which little information is
available. This is a common result, especially
when a large number of genes are tested at
the same time.

You carry a variant in a tested gene
that can't be detected using current
technology

Over time, more information may become
available and your health care provider may
provide you with an update on the meaning of
these variants. Until then, these aren't used to
make care decisions.

You carry a variant in a gene that wasn't
included in the testing panel
You have several family members
diagnosed with cancer, but none is linked
to a known hereditary cancer gene

Mosaic results
When someone has two or more sets of cells
that differ genetically from one another, the
results are called mosaic. This is thought to be
caused by an error in mitosis (cell division) in a
growing baby during pregnancy.

Uninformative negative results
If you test negative, and your relatives with
early-onset or suspicious cancers haven't been
tested, it's called an uninformative negative.

Mosaicism can lead to many kinds of
disorders. Referral to a genetics provider is
recommended for mosaic results.

It's uninformative because you still don't know
whether they carried a variant that you didn't
inherit, or whether their cancers can't be
explained by known hereditary cancer genes.

This chapter describes the criteria

The cancer has a mutation

used to determine whether genetic

If you have cancer, your tumor tissue
may have been tested for features, called
biomarkers, that can help guide your
treatment. Biomarker testing is different
than genetic testing for germline (inherited)
mutations. Biomarkers are often mutations
(changes) in particular genes. Mutations in
the tumor or cancer itself are called somatic,
acquired, or simply tumor mutations.

testing would be helpful for you,
as well as recommended care for
a positive result.

General recommendations

For some hereditary cancers, planning the
best treatment depends on whether you were
born with the same difference in DNA that
was found in your tumor. If the cancer itself
has a pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP)
mutation and it would impact your care if the
variant is also germline (inherited), genetic
testing is recommended.

Testing is recommended in the situations
described on this page. If you have a personal
or family history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic,
or prostate cancer, more specific guidance is
provided later in this chapter.

Cancer-causing variants in relatives

Who else might benefit from
testing?

If you have any blood relatives with a
confirmed cancer-causing gene variant,
genetic testing is recommended.

People of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are
at higher risk than average of carrying certain
cancer-causing gene variants. Testing may
be considered if you are of Ashkenazi Jewish
ancestry, even if you don’t have any other risk
factors.

To help make treatment decisions
If you have cancer, genetic testing can
help your provider make decisions about
chemotherapy and other forms of systemic
therapy. Specifically, whether platinum
chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors would be
helpful for certain cancers.

Genetic testing may also be considered for
those diagnosed with serous endometrial
cancer, a rare type of uterine cancer that may
be linked with BRCA variants.

The results can also guide decisions about
whether to have risk-reducing surgery in order
to prevent breast or ovarian cancer.

3 Testing criteria and results-based care » Breast cancer

Breast cancer

A hereditary cause is identified in about 1 in
10 breast cancers. Breast cancer susceptibility
genes include BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2,
CDH1, CHEK2, NF1, PALB2, PTEN, STK11,
and TP53.

Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast.
Almost all breast cancers are carcinomas.
Carcinomas are cancers that start in the cells
that line the inner or outer surfaces of the
body. Anyone can develop breast cancer,
including those assigned male at birth.

If you meet the testing criteria described next,
personalized risk assessment and genetic
counseling are recommended. Genetic testing
is often part of the process.

There are different types of breast carcinoma.
The most common types are either ductal or
lobular.




Ductal carcinoma starts in the cells
that line the milk ducts. Ductal carcinoma
is the most common type of breast
cancer.
Lobular carcinoma starts in the
lobules (milk glands) of the breast.

In this patient guide, the term breast cancer
includes invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

Managing your risk
In people at increased risk
of hereditary breast cancer,
screening with mammograms,
breast MRIs, or both is often
recommended in order to detect
cancer growth early.

3 Testing criteria and results-based care » Breast cancer

Testing in people with breast cancer

To guide your care – In people with
metastatic breast cancer, genetic testing is
recommended to help decide whether PARP
inhibitor therapy should be considered.

If you've been diagnosed with breast cancer
and any of the following apply to you, genetic
testing is recommended.

In those with high-risk, HER2-negative breast
cancer, testing is recommended to help decide
if PARP inhibitor therapy would be helpful after
primary treatment. Ask your oncologist if the
cancer is high risk.

Age – You were diagnosed with breast cancer
at or before age 50
Ancestry – You are of Ashkenazi Jewish
ancestry

If you are receiving treatment for any type of
cancer, a positive result may affect the clinical
trials you are eligible for.

Cancer type – You've been diagnosed with
any of the following:


Male breast cancer



Triple-negative breast cancer



More than 1 type of breast cancer



If you don't meet the criteria just
described
If you haven't been diagnosed with breast
cancer, or you have but don't meet the criteria
just described, testing is recommended in
the following situations.

Lobular breast cancer and you have a
personal or family history of diffuse gastric
cancer

Family history – You have 1 or more close
blood relatives with any of the following:




breast cancer diagnosed at age 50 or
earlier



male breast cancer



ovarian cancer



pancreatic cancer



metastatic or high-risk prostate cancer



You have a 5% or higher risk of a
BRCA1/2 variant based on an earlier risk
calculator, like BRCAPro and CanRisk.

Genetic testing may also be considered if
any of the following apply to you:


Testing is also recommended if you have 3
relatives (including you) on the same side of
your family that have breast or prostate cancer.





NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Genetic Testing for Hereditary Cancers, 2025

You have a first- or second-degree
blood relative that meets the criteria just
described

19

You were diagnosed with breast cancer
between age 51 and age 65.
You were diagnosed with breast cancer
(at any age) and have 1 or more close
blood relatives with certain types of
prostate cancer.
You have a history of malignant phyllodes
tumors.

3 Testing criteria and results-based care » Breast cancer

Testing may also be an option for those with
a 2.5% to 5% risk of a BRCA1/2 variant,
according to an earlier risk calculator. In
this case, when deciding whether to include
genes other than BRCA1/2, your provider will
consider your preferences, your insurance
coverage, and the speed of results. The more
genes that are tested, the more likely you
are to get a variant of uncertain significance
(VUS).

Managing your breast cancer risk
after a positive result

Who isn’t likely to benefit from
testing?

Recommendations for lowering risk are
guided by the penetrance of the specific gene
variant(s) identified. See Guide 8 on page
35 for complete guidance according to gene.

A positive result means that a germline
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was
found in the susceptibility genes included in
the testing panel.
Based on your results, your provider may
recommend some of the strategies described
next to reduce your risk of breast cancer.

In people who don't have close relatives with
breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer,
testing is unlikely to find high-risk variants in
the following groups:




Breast awareness
Breast awareness involves becoming familiar
with your breasts and reporting any changes
to your health care provider. Doing breast self
exams on a regular basis may help you notice
changes. If you are premenopausal, doing the
exams when your period is almost over may
be most helpful.

Those assigned female at birth diagnosed
with breast cancer after age 65
Men diagnosed with localized prostate
cancer and a Gleason Score below 7.
The Gleason score usually ranges from
6 to 10. The lower the score, the slower
the cancer cells are expected to grow and
spread.

Screening mammogram
A screening mammogram uses low-dose
x-rays to take 4 pictures of your breast (two on
each side). A radiologist reviews the images
and decides if you need additional imaging.
If you do, you will likely have a diagnostic
mammogram.
A diagnostic mammogram usually involves
taking more detailed x-ray pictures of the
breast from different angles to check the
suspicious area more closely.

Clinical breast exam

For a breast MRI, a gadolinium-based contrast
agent (GBCA)—a rare, heavy metal—is used
to enhance the quality of the MRI. There
are no harmful effects from GBCA, but it

afterward. Talk to your provider if you have any
concerns. The MRI should be done with and
without contrast.

Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam
of the bare breast performed by a health care
provider to check for lumps or other changes.
While you are seated or lying down, your
provider will palpate (feel) the entire breast,
including the armpit. A nurse or assistant might
also be in the room during the exam.

Risk-reducing mastectomy

Breast MRI

Having surgery to remove the breasts lowers
the risk of developing breast cancer. Surgery
to remove both breasts for this purpose is
called risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of areas inside the body. It
doesn't use radiation.

Risk-reducing mastectomy is an option to
consider for those with germline variants in
certain breast cancer susceptibility genes,
including BRCA1/2, CDH1, PALB2, PTEN
(associated with Cowden syndrome), STK11,
and TP53 (associated with Li-Fraumeni

Your provider may recommend breast MRI in

stopping aromatase (an enzyme in fat tissue)
from converting other hormones in the body
into estrogen.

In premenopausal people, tamoxifen is
most commonly used. This selective estrogen
receptor modulator (SERM) reduces the
amount of estrogen in the body.
Tamoxifen is typically prescribed as a 20 mg
pill for 5 years. Sometimes it is prescribed for
fewer years at a lower dose.
In postmenopausal people, either raloxifene
(Evista) or an aromatase inhibitor is typically
recommended.
Raloxifene is an estrogen blocker like
tamoxifen. For breast cancer prevention,
raloxifene is typically prescribed at a dose of

3 Testing criteria and results-based care » Ovarian cancer

Ovarian cancer

Risk-reducing salpingooophorectomy

Most ovarian cancers actually start in the
fallopian tubes. The cancer forms in the
surface layer of tissue, called the epithelium.
There are more than 5 types of epithelial
ovarian cancer. The most common forms are:


High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)



High-grade endometrioid carcinoma

Surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian
tubes in order to lower the risk of cancer is
called risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy
(RRSO). RRSO is recommended for those
with germline cancer-causing variants in the
BRCA1/2, BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D
genes. And it's an option for those with variants
in several other genes.

Ovarian cancer susceptibility genes include
ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, PALB2,
RAD51C, RAD51D, and the Lynch syndrome
genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, EPCAM).

RRSO can impact your health, emotional
well-being, and quality of life. If you will be
premenopausal when RRSO is performed,
arrange to consult with a menopause specialist
beforehand. More information on surgical
menopause is provided on the next page.

Testing criteria

Option of hysterectomy at time of RRSO
People with germline BRCA variants may be
at slightly higher risk of serous uterine cancer
than the average person. Ask your provider
about the risks and benefits of removing your
uterus at the same time as RRSO.

Testing is recommended for anyone who has
been diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer
(including fallopian tube cancer and peritoneal
cancer) at any age.
If you've never been diagnosed with ovarian
cancer, testing is recommended if:




You have a first- or second-degree blood
relative diagnosed with epithelial ovarian
cancer (including fallopian tube cancer or
peritoneal cancer) at any age.
You don't meet the criteria above but have
a probability above 5% of a BRCA1/2
variant based on an earlier risk calculator,
like BRCAPro or CanRisk.

Based on your specific results, your provider
may recommend taking steps to reduce your risk
of ovarian cancer, such as risk-reducing surgery.

3 Testing criteria and results-based care » Ovarian cancer

Surgical menopause

If you have symptoms, your provider may
suggest menopausal hormone therapy (MHT).
This approach used to be called hormone
replacement therapy (HRT). It can help lessen
side effects and is something to consider if you
don't have breast cancer.

If you are premenopausal, surgically removing
the ovaries results in a sudden drop in
estrogen in the body. This drop can cause
symptoms of menopause, including:


Hot flashes



Sleeping problems



Night sweats



Changes in mood



If your uterus is left in place at the time of
RRSO, MHT with estrogen alone may increase
your risk of endometrial cancer. For this
reason, options typically include:


Vaginal lining can become thin, dry, and
irritated (vaginal atrophy)



Cognitive changes



Weight gain



There are also long-term risks of having a low
estrogen level, including heart disease and
weak bones (osteoporosis).

3 Testing criteria and results-based care » Pancreatic cancer

Pancreatic cancer

If you opt for hysterectomy during RRSO,
you will be a candidate for estrogen-only
menopausal hormone therapy. Using estrogen
alone is linked with a decreased risk of breast
cancer compared to the use of both estrogen
and progestin.

Pancreatic cancer starts in a digestive gland
called the pancreas. The pancreas makes
enzymes that break down proteins, fats,
sugars, and starches. It also makes hormones
called insulin and glucagon that control blood
sugar levels.

Risk-reducing salpingectomy
Surgery to remove the fallopian tubes is called
salpingectomy. If you are premenopausal
and not ready to lose your ovaries, removing
the fallopian tubes first and the ovaries later
may be an option. But, this approach is not
the standard of care for people at high risk of
ovarian cancer.

There are 2 main types of pancreatic cancer.
The more common type forms from exocrine
cells. Exocrine cells make and move digestive
enzymes.
A hereditary cause of pancreatic cancer is
found in about 1 in 10 people. Genetic testing
is recommended for everyone diagnosed with
exocrine pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer
susceptibility genes include ATM, BRCA1,
BRCA2, CDKN2A, PALB2, STK11, TP53, and
Lynch syndrome genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
EPCAM).

While salpingectomy has been shown to lower
ovarian cancer risk in the general population,
it hasn't been proven to lower risk in those at
high risk. In those at high risk, removing the
ovaries and fallopian tubes is recommended.
This is called a risk-reducing salpingooophorectomy (RRSO).

Hereditary pancreatitis is sometimes caused
by germline variants in PRSS1, SPINK1, and
related genes. While these individuals are
also at increased risk of pancreatic cancer,
germline testing for these genes is only
recommended if you also have a personal or
family history of exocrine pancreatic cancer.

After the fallopian tubes are removed, consider
continuing your combination birth control pills
or hormonal IUD. This may keep your ovarian
cancer risk low while you still have your
ovaries.
Salpingectomy is an option for those assigned
female at birth who also want tubal ligation.
This form of surgical sterilization prevents
pregnancy by stopping the sperm and egg
from meeting.

Care for positive results is described on the
next page.

If you freeze eggs or embryos, to become
pregnant later you'll need your uterus but not
your ovaries or fallopian tubes.

PSA
PSA is a protein made inside the prostate
gland. Its job is to help semen transport sperm.
All prostate cells, both normal cells and cancer
cells, make PSA.
If there’s something wrong with the prostate—
like prostate cancer—the prostate may make
more PSA. While most PSA goes into semen,
a little bit ends up in the bloodstream, too. An
unusually high amount of PSA in the blood
may be a sign of prostate cancer.
However, age and other factors—such as an
enlarged prostate or a urinary tract infection—
can also cause high levels of PSA.

3 Testing criteria and results-based care » Li-Fraumeni syndrome

Tumors with the TP53 biomarker

If whole-body MRI isn't available to you, ask
your provider about available clinical trials
you may be able to join. Also ask about other
advanced imaging methods that may be an
option.

It's possible--and even common--for someone
born without a germline TP53 variant to
have a tumor with a somatic (acquired) TP53
mutation. For example, unlike other types of
sarcoma, germline TP53 variants are rare in
those with Ewing sarcoma, gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST), desmoid tumors, or
angiosarcoma.

LFS and radiation therapy
Radiation increases the risk of developing a
sarcoma. If you are receiving treatment for
cancer, radiation therapy is typically avoided if
you have other good treatment options.

If you don't meet testing criteria but the cancer
has a TP53 mutation, genetic testing might be
ordered. Your personal and family history will
be reviewed in order to determine if genetic
testing is worthwhile.

But sometimes radiation therapy is needed. In
this case, make an informed decision by fully
discussing the benefits of radiation compared
to the risk of second cancers caused by
radiation.

Testing is typically ordered for those diagnosed
with any cancer before age 30, or if your
provider feels that it's appropriate.

Children with positive results
If LFS runs in your family, make your
pediatrician aware of the risk of childhood
cancers.

Adults with positive results
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is rare. Referral to a
specialized team or center with expertise in
this syndrome is recommended.

In families with LFS, the following screening
measures are recommended to help detect
cancer early in children:

People with LFS are at high risk of developing
more than one type of cancer. Unfortunately,
there isn't a good screening method for all of
them.

Recommended steps to lower your risk

Breast cancer

• Get a yearly mammogram starting at age 40
• Considering your age, family history, breast density, and preferences,
your provider may recommend breast MRI starting at age 30 to 35.

Prostate cancer

There is growing evidence of a link between the CHEK2 gene and prostate
cancer. Your provider may recommend checking your PSA starting at age
40.

MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM (associated with Lynch syndrome)
Lynch syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary colon and endometrial (uterine)
cancers. Families with Lynch syndrome are also at increased risk of urothelial, brain,
gastrointestinal, ovarian, breast, pancreatic, biliary, and other cancers.
The criteria for testing for Lynch syndrome and care for a positive result is beyond the scope
of this guide. For more information, health care providers are encouraged to refer to the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal,
Endometrial, and Gastric.

PALB2
Increased risk of

Recommended steps to lower your risk

Breast cancer

• Get a yearly mammogram and breast MRI starting at age 30
• Discuss the option of risk-reducing mastectomy with your provider.
• For those assigned male at birth, your provider may recommend the
same breast cancer screening strategy recommended for BRCA
carriers.

Epithelial ovarian
cancer

Talk to your provider about the option of risk-reducing salpingooophorectomy around age 45 or 50.

Pancreatic cancer

See page 25 for information on pancreatic cancer screening.

PTEN (associated with Cowden syndrome)
People with germline PTEN variants are at increased risk of breast, thyroid, colorectal,
endometrial, and kidney cancer. See page 32 for information on Cowden syndrome/PTEN
hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS).

RAD51C and RAD51D
Increased risk of

Recommended steps to lower your risk

Breast cancer

Get a yearly mammogram (and possibly also breast MRI) starting at age
40. Other care is guided by your family history.

3 Testing criteria and results-based care » Gene-specific care

STK11 (associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome)
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a hereditary cancer syndrome that causes benign tumors
to grow in the gastrointestinal tract and dark spots to form on the skin. People with PJS have
a high risk of developing cancers of the breast, colon, stomach, ovaries, small intestine,
pancreas, cervix, uterus, lungs, and testes. Most people with PJS have a cancer-causing
germline variant in the STK11 gene.
Genetic testing for PJS and care for a positive result are beyond the scope of this guide. For
more information, health care providers are encouraged to refer to the NCCN Clinical Practice
Guidelines in Oncology for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal, Endometrial,
and Gastric. See below for information on managing breast and pancreatic cancer risk in people
with this variant.

Breast cancer

• Get a yearly mammogram and breast MRI starting at age 30.
• Discuss the option of risk-reducing mastectomy with your provider.

Pancreatic cancer

See page 25 for information on pancreatic cancer screening.

TP53 (associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome)
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is caused by a pathogenic variant in the TP53 gene. Families with
LFS have a high risk of developing a range of cancers, especially sarcomas, leukemias, brain
cancers, breast cancers, and adrenocortical tumors.
Many other cancers have been linked with LFS, including melanoma, colorectal, gastric, and
prostate cancers. See page 29 for information on Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

Key points










In adults with a positive result, frequent
physical exams and yearly MRIs (wholebody and brain) are recommended.
Mammograms and breast MRIs are
recommended to manage breast cancer
risk. Risk-reducing mastectomy is also an
option.

In people diagnosed with breast cancer,
genetic testing decisions are based on
age, ancestry, family history, cancer
type, and cancer features. If results are
positive, your provider may recommend
managing your risk with clinical breast
exams, mammograms, breast MRIs, riskreducing mastectomy, or risk-reducing
drugs.



Genetic testing is recommended for
everyone diagnosed with epithelial
ovarian cancer (at any age), and for
their first- and second-degree blood
relatives. If results are positive, riskreducing salpingo-oophorectomy may
be recommended to lower your risk.
Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)
may be an option to relieve symptoms of
surgical menopause.

Questions to ask

Genetic testing is recommended for
everyone diagnosed with exocrine
pancreatic cancer. If results are
positive, your provider may recommend
yearly screening with endoscopic
ultrasound or magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography once you
reach a certain age.







In people diagnosed with prostate cancer,
genetic testing decisions are based on
ancestry, family history, cancer stage, and
cancer risk level. If results are positive,
your provider may recommend blood tests
to check your prostate specific antigen
(PSA) level.
Genetic testing for Li-Fraumeni syndrome
is recommended if you meet specific
criteria, if a germline TP53 variant runs in
your family, and in some other situations.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Genetic Testing for Hereditary Cancers, 2025

Genetic testing is recommended for
those with a clinical diagnosis of Cowden
syndrome/PTEN hamartoma tumor
syndrome and in some other situations.
If results are positive, care to manage
your risk involves yearly physical exams,
staying alert for signs of endometrial
cancer, and screening for breast,
colorectal, kidney, skin, and thyroid
cancers. Risk-reducing mastectomy is an
option to lower breast cancer risk.

41

Based on my results, which cancers am I
at risk for?
Does having risk-reducing surgery to
prevent ovarian or breast cancer mean
that I'll never have to worry about getting
those cancers?
Is risk-reducing mastectomy something I
need to consider? If so, who can help me
decide?
