About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Thyroid Carcinoma, Version 3.2024 — June 18, 2024.

There are different types of thyroid

cancer. Most are curable with the
right treatment. When possible,

The two main hormones made by the thyroid
are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).
Together, these are often referred to simply as
“thyroid hormone.” The thyroid uses a mineral
from your diet called iodine to produce these
hormones. Certain foods and iodized salt
contain iodine.

surgery is recommended for most
thyroid cancers.

The thyroid

There are four pea-sized glands on the
back of the thyroid gland. These parathyroid
glands control the amount of calcium in your
bloodstream.

The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the
front of the neck. It has 2 lobes, a right and a
left. A thin piece of tissue called the isthmus
connects the lobes.
The thyroid makes hormones. These
substances are essential for the body to
function properly. They circulate in the blood

Who is at risk?

Thyroid nodules
Thyroid nodules are small, often round areas
of abnormal growth within the thyroid gland.
Most are not cancerous. Very small nodules
usually can't be seen or felt. Your provider
may be able to see or feel a large nodule while
examining your lower neck.

Those assigned female at birth are 3 times
more likely to be diagnosed with a thyroid
cancer compared to those assigned male at
birth.
Compared to other cancers, thyroid cancer is
often diagnosed earlier in adulthood. It is the
most common cancer in adults aged 18 to 33
years. For more information on cancer in this
group, see NCCN Guidelines for Patients:
Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer at NCCN.
org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Most thyroid nodules don't cause symptoms.
They are often found by imaging tests done
for a different reason. Symptoms of a larger
nodule could include:


A visible lump in the neck



Neck pain



Voice changes



Trouble breathing



Problems swallowing

Anything that increases the chances of
developing a disease is called a risk factor.
The most well-known risk factors for thyroid
cancer are described next. Most people with
thyroid cancer have no known risk factors.

Radiation exposure
Anyone who has had radiation treatment to the
head or neck in the past (to treat a childhood
cancer, for example) is at increased risk of
thyroid cancer.
Contact with large amounts of radiation in the
environment as a result of a catastrophic event
also increases the risk of developing a thyroid
cancer.

Family history
Most thyroid cancers are sporadic, meaning
there is no clear cause or risk factor. Only a
small number are hereditary, or the result of
inherited gene mutations (changes).



A personal or family history of thyroid cancer
or a related syndrome may increase the risk of
thyroid cancer. Syndromes related to thyroid
cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP), Carney complex, Cowden syndrome,
and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN).





Cowden syndrome is also known as PTEN
hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). This
inherited syndrome can cause follicular
thyroid cancer, and other cancers and
health problems. Tell your provider if you
have a personal or family history of breast,
endometrial, or colorectal cancer.

The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland
in the neck. It makes hormones that help
regulate metabolism and other body
functions.
Thyroid cancers start as small, often
round areas of abnormal growth called
nodules. Most don’t cause symptoms and
are benign.
Thyroid cancer is the most common
cancer in adults aged 18 to 33 years. The
most well-known risk factors are radiation

Ultrasound

TSH test

Ultrasound is the most common imaging
technique used to look for thyroid cancer. It
uses sound waves to form images showing the
size, shape, and location of a thyroid nodule.

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a
hormone made by the pituitary gland, located
near the base of the brain. TSH controls the
hormones made by the thyroid.

Biopsy

hand-held device called an ultrasound probe
is used. After a gel is applied to the skin, the
probe is moved back and forth over the thyroid
area.

A biopsy removes samples of fluid or tissue
from the body to be tested. Your doctor will
consider the nodule size and other features as
seen on the ultrasound to determine if a biopsy
is needed. Some nodules don't need to be
biopsied and are monitored with ultrasound.

If ultrasound finds any suspicious lymph nodes
in the neck, further imaging with CT or MRI is
recommended. A substance called contrast is
used to make the pictures clearer.

If a biopsy is needed, fine-needle aspiration
(also called needle biopsy or FNA) is
recommended. This method uses a thin needle
to take small samples of suspicious thyroid
nodules. Ultrasound is usually done at the
same time to help pinpoint the suspicious
areas.

Pathology review
The biopsy samples are sent to a pathologist.
Pathologists are physicians with expertise
in examining tissues and cells to diagnose
disease. By examining the sample under
a microscope, the pathologist is able to
determine whether the nodule is cancerous,
and if so, the cancer type.
In certain types of lesions, such as follicular
and oncocytic tumors, fine-needle biopsy
can identify the nature of the cells, but can't
determine if the nodule is cancerous. For
these lesions, surgery is often needed to make
a final diagnosis. Now, molecular tests are
available that can help determine whether the
nodule is cancerous and whether surgery is
necessary.
Papillary carcinoma is the most common
type of thyroid cancer, followed by follicular
carcinoma, then oncocytic. Papillary, follicular,
and oncocytic carcinomas are known as the
differentiated thyroid cancers. Differentiated

cancers usually grow and spread slowly.
Treatment of these types is addressed in
Chapter 4.

Medullary thyroid cancer is the third most
common type of thyroid cancer. This type can
be inherited, meaning it can run in families.
Medullary thyroid cancer is the focus of
Chapter 5.



Anaplastic thyroid cancer is the most
aggressive type of thyroid cancer. It is rare and
most often affects older adults. This type is the
focus of Chapter 6.

The type and other features of biopsied lesions
are recorded in a pathology report. Ask for a
copy of the report to have for your records.

voice and swallowing

Thyroid hormone replacement
therapy
After a total thyroidectomy, medicine is used to
replace the hormones no longer being supplied
by the thyroid. This is called thyroid hormone
replacement therapy. It is needed lifelong in
all people after total thyroidectomy. After a
lobectomy, about 1 in 3 people need thyroid
hormone therapy.

Lobectomy
A lobectomy removes the lobe of the thyroid
that contains the cancerous nodule. The tissue
connecting the two lobes (the isthmus) is also
removed. While under general anesthesia, a
small incision is made in the front of the neck
to remove the cancerous lobe.

Levothyroxine (eg, Levoxyl; Synthroid) is
the most commonly used thyroid hormone
replacement therapy. The goal for most people
is to keep the level of thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) in the low normal range.

Lobectomy may be an option for some small
and low-risk differentiated thyroid cancers.

Total thyroidectomy

For higher risk thyroid cancers, or if there
are signs of recurrence, the TSH level is kept
lower than the normal range (suppressed).
This helps prevent thyroid cancer cells from
growing or returning. Suppression is an
important part of cancer therapy for most
differentiated thyroid cancers.

A total thyroidectomy removes the entire
thyroid gland. Lymph nodes near the thyroid
are also removed if they are known or
suspected to have cancer. This is called a
neck dissection.

3 Treatments » Surgery

Levothyroxine is taken as a pill once a day. It
must be taken on an empty stomach, at least
30 mintutes prior to eating a meal. If not, it
won't be adequately absorbed into the blood.
Finding the right dose can take some trial and
error. If the dose isn't optimal, common side
effects include:


Anxiety



Trouble sleeping





Treatment team
Treating thyroid cancer takes a team
of experts. Your care team may include
an endocrinologist, radiologist, nuclear
medicine specialist, surgeon, radiation
oncologist, and medical oncologist.
You and your team will decide on a
treatment plan that is best for you. This
written course of action covers every
phase of the treatment process.

Racing heart (with or without an abnormal
heartbeat)
Sweating

Blood tests are used to check the TSH level
on a regular basis during thyroid replacement
therapy. Your doctor can find the right dose of
thyroid hormone for you by checking the TSH
level and adjusting the dose as needed.
Too much levothyroxine can cause health
problems, including:


Weakened bones



Heart rhythm problems



Having too much thyroid hormone
(thyrotoxicosis)

Calcium and vitamin D
Your provider may recommend taking calcium
and vitamin D supplements to help strengthen
your bones.

Radioactive iodine

of thyrotropin alfa (Thyrogen) can be used to
increase the TSH level. Thyrogen activates
iodine uptake so that hormone replacement
can be continued therapy and imaging.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy uses a form
of radioactive iodine (iodine-131) to selectively
kill thyroid cancer cells that take up (“eat”)
iodine.

Possible side effects of RAI therapy include:

The goal is to target only the thyroid cells in
the neck (both cancer cells and any remaining
normal thyroid cells) and elsewhere in the
body while sparing healthy cells and tissues.
RAI therapy may be used in the following
situations:








To lower the chances that a high-risk
cancer returns after treatment

Neck pain or swelling in glands near the
jaw



Nausea and vomiting



Dry mouth or eyes



Watery eyes



Change in taste or smell

The dose of RAI therapy is often adjusted for
children with thyroid cancer and people on
dialysis for kidney disease. If any cancer can
be removed by surgery, this will be considered
before starting RAI therapy.

To treat thyroid cancer that has spread
within the body
Shortly after thyroidectomy for some
lower-risk cancers, using lower-dose
iodine-131 (also known as remnant
ablation)

Safety measures

RAI therapy is used after total thyroidectomy
for differentiated thyroid cancers that take up
iodine. It is generally only recommended for
cancers at higher risk of coming back. RAI
isn’t effective against medullary or anaplastic
thyroid cancer.

The radiation will exit your body through urine
and other body fluids. This means that your
body will give off small amounts of radiation
after treatment. For a short time, you will
need to take safety measures around others,
especially children and pregnant people.

How is it given?

Whole-body RAI scan

RAI therapy comes in liquid or pill form and
is taken by mouth. You may be asked to eat
a diet low in iodine for 1 to 2 weeks before
starting this treatment.

After RAI, a whole-body radioiodine scan is
performed to look for remaining thyroid tissue
and “hidden” areas of thyroid cancer in the
body. At some treatment centers, a wholebody scan is also done before RAI therapy.
This imaging can be done using small doses
of iodine-131 or a similar form of radioactive
iodine called iodine-123.

You need a high level of TSH for RAI therapy.
Thyroid hormone replacement may be stopped
for a few weeks beforehand. If this isn’t
recommended for you, hormone injections

stiffness in your neck. It may also be helpful if
the cancer has spread to another organ, such
as the bones or brain, to stop the cancer from
growing in that specific area.

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or
particles to destroy small areas of cancer. To
treat thyroid cancer, radiation is given using a
large machine outside the body. This is called
external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).

You will first have a planning session called a
simulation. You will be placed in the treatment
position and a CT scan or other type of scan
will be done. The images will be used to make
a radiation plan tailored to your body and
cancer.

Radiation therapy is rarely used for papillary
and follicular cancers. Anaplastic thyroid
cancer, in contrast, is almost always treated
with radiation therapy.

During radiation treatment, you will lie on a
table in the same position as during simulation.
A technician will operate the machine from
a nearby room, but will be able to see, hear,
and speak with you at all times. You won't feel
anything while the radiation is being delivered.
One treatment session can take 30 to 60

Radiation therapy may be used for thyroid
cancer that can't be removed with surgery and
doesn't respond to RAI therapy.
Radiation therapy can also relieve symptoms
caused by cancer spread, such as difficulty or
pain swallowing, loss of your voice, or pain or

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses
high-energy radiation

Fertility and family planning
If you want the option of having
children after treatment or are unsure,
tell your care team. Your doctor will
discuss any fertility-related risks of
your treatment plan with you. You may
be referred for counseling about your
fertility preservation options.

While most side effects of radiation therapy
start during treatment and stop shortly after
it is over, some can occur years later. If your
doctor recommends external radiation, they
will discuss what to expect from treatment,
including possible short- and long-term side
effects.

Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy side effects
Side effects of systemic therapy can include:

Systemic therapy is treatment with substances
that travel in the bloodstream, reaching and
affecting cells throughout the body.
Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and
immunotherapy are types of systemic therapy.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapies can target and attack
specific types of cancer cells. They are
generally only used for thyroid cancers that:



Tiredness (fatigue)

Side effects seen more often with targeted
therapy include body aches, rash, high blood
pressure, and abnormal bleeding.

Have returned after treatment
Have spread to areas far from the neck
(metastasized) and are continuing to grow

Some targeted therapies have serious side
effects that can affect your heart, skin, and
digestive system. If systemic therapy is
planned, ask your care team for a complete list
of potential side effects.

The targeted therapies currently used for
thyroid cancer are called kinase inhibitors.
Most are capsules that you swallow.

Chemotherapy

Most side effects only occur during cancer
treatment. But, some can start years later.
For example, long-term side effects of
chemotherapy can include other cancers, heart
disease, and not being able to have children.

Chemotherapy doesn't work well against most
thyroid cancers. It may be used for cancer
that isn't responding to other treatment, or that
has spread to distant areas of the body. It is
most often used in combination with radiation
therapy for anaplastic thyroid cancer—the
least common and most aggressive type.
Most chemotherapy medicines are put directly
into the bloodstream through a vein.

3 Treatments » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may be
approved by the U.S. FDA.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.




Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. Try not to
be discouraged if you cannot join. New clinical
trials are always becoming available.

Phase 1 trials study the safety and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach.
Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many people with cancer.

Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or childcare due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and

Papillary thyroid cancer

Papillary, follicular, and oncocytic
carcinoma are known as

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most
common of all the thyroid cancers. The most
common subtype is “classic type.” Other
subtypes that may grow and spread more
quickly include:

differentiated thyroid cancers.
These cancers usually grow
slowly and have good treatment
outcomes.



Differentiated thyroid cancers are treated with
surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid.
For many years, total thyroidectomy was the
standard treatment for all thyroid cancers.
Today, it remains a treatment option for
everyone with thyroid cancer.

Is surgery always needed?
Some small papillary tumors (no bigger than a
pea) may be safely monitored without surgery.
This approach is known as active surveillance.
The size of the cancer is monitored using
ultrasound.

However, newer research shows that
lobectomy may be just as effective for treating
small, low-risk cancers that haven't grown
or spread beyond the thyroid. A potential
benefit of lobectomy is that thyroid hormone
replacement therapy may not be needed. Or, a
lower dose may be needed.

For active surveillance to be an option,
there also can't be any nearby lymph nodes
suspicious for cancer, and the tumor can't be
in a high-risk location (such as the back of the
thyroid, butting up against the trachea).

Thyroidectomy or lobectomy?
If surgery is needed, either a total
thyroidectomy or lobectomy is performed.
Some papillary cancers should always be
treated with total thyroidectomy. A total
thyroidectomy is recommended for papillary
cancers that have grown or spread beyond
the thyroid—whether into the neck, to nearby
lymph nodes, or to distant areas.

After total thyroidectomy

Tumors larger than 4 centimeters (cm) (about
the size of a walnut) and high-risk types of
papillary cancer should also be treated with
total thyroidectomy. Lymph nodes near the
thyroid that are known to have cancer are also
removed during surgery.

If the results of surgery are very good,
radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is sometimes
used to kill cancer cells left in the body.
If a concerning amount of cancer remains after
surgery, treatment options may include:

There are other reasons your doctor may
recommend a total thyroidectomy. Factors
such as whether the neck area was ever
treated with radiation therapy will be
considered.
If the cancer is small and noninvasive,
lobectomy may be a treatment option in
addition to thyroidectomy. Treatment with
lobectomy is preferred if the following criteria
are met:

The tumor is 1 to 4 cm in size.

The extent of the cancer can't be fully known
until the surgeon sees the thyroid, tumor, and
surrounding areas first-hand, as well as the
results of the pathologic exam of the removed
tissues. If the cancer is larger or more invasive
than expected during a lobectomy, the decision
is usually made during surgery to remove the
entire thyroid.

After lobectomy
After a lobectomy, everything that was
removed or sampled (biopsied) during surgery
is examined and tested. If examination of
the tumor, other tissue, or lymph nodes by a
pathologist finds certain concerning or highrisk features, another surgery to remove the
rest of the thyroid (completion thyroidectomy)
is recommended.

Let us know what
you think!

If the results of surgery and pathologic
examination are very good and no highrisk features are found, more surgery isn’t
usually needed. Your doctor may recommend
thyroid hormone replacement therapy with
levothyroxine to keep the TSH level low or
normal. This is on a case-by-case basis.

Please take a moment to

Because the thyroid continues to make
hormones after a lobectomy, hormone
replacement therapy isn’t always needed.

NIFTP
Pathologic examination after surgery may find
that the tumor is a noninvasive follicular thyroid
neoplasm with papillary‑like nuclear features
(NIFTP). A NIFTP is a low-risk, noninvasive
thyroid tumor.
NIFTP was previously known as the
encapsulated follicular variant of papillary
thyroid cancer. No further treatment is needed
after an NIFTP is surgically removed.

pathologic examination of the removed tissues.
If the cancer is more invasive than expected
during a lobectomy, the decision is usually
made during surgery to remove the entire
thyroid.

Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is the
second most common type of thyroid cancer.
Oncocytic carcinoma is uncommon. This type
was formerly known as Hürthle cell carcinoma
(HCC). Compared to papillary and follicular
tumors, oncocytic carcinoma is more likely to
spread to lymph nodes by the time it is found.

After total thyroidectomy
After surgery, everything that was removed
or sampled (biopsied) is examined by a
pathologist. Pathologic examination may find
that the tumor is benign (not cancer). In this
case, no more cancer treatment is needed.
Lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy
is needed, however.

Both follicular and oncocytic thyroid cancers
are known for invading blood vessels in and
around the thyroid. These cancers can’t be
diagnosed with a needle biopsy alone. Fineneedle aspiration (FNA) can only suggest
these types.

If pathologic examination confirms follicular
or oncocytic thyroid cancer, further treatment
depends on the results of surgery. RAI therapy
may be used to kill cancer cells left in the body.
See the next page for more information.

In order to be diagnosed as follicular or
oncocytic cancer, the cancer must have grown
into veins or arteries in and around the thyroid,
or into the outer layer of the tumor. This can
be learned by pathologic examination of the
removed thyroid, or in some cases with genetic
testing of the biopsy sample.

If a concerning amount of cancer remains after
surgery, there is more than one possibility.
Options may include:

Total thyroidectomy or lobectomy?
A total thyroidectomy is recommended for a
suspected follicular or oncocytic tumor that
has grown beyond the thyroid. The surgeon
will also remove any nearby lymph nodes
known to have cancer. Your provider may also
recommend total thyroidectomy if the tumor is
larger than 4 cm.

after total thyroidectomy.

After total thyroidectomy

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)



Thyroglobulin (Tg)



Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg ab)

Thyroglobulin (Tg) is only made by thyroid
tissue. If the thyroid is removed, there
shouldn’t be any Tg in the blood. Therefore,
checking the Tg level can serve as a way to
monitor for the return of cancer. If the Tg level
rises, it could be a sign that further testing is
needed to check for recurrence.

Short-term follow-up after total thyroidectomy
involves a physical exam and blood tests. A
neck ultrasound is also recommended 6 to
12 months after surgery. More information on
blood tests is provided on the next page.
If you had RAI therapy after total
thyroidectomy, you may have whole-body RAI
imaging to look for cancer after treatment. It
may be helpful for high-risk patients, those with
metastases that took up iodine, or those with
abnormal blood or ultrasound results.

A small number of people with thyroid cancer
make antibodies in response to Tg. These antiTg antibodies in blood can interfere with the Tg
level. If the anti-Tg antibody level goes down,
it may be a sign that treatment is working. If

check for cancer recurrence.

Short-term follow-up after lobectomy involves
a physical exam and TSH blood test. A
neck ultrasound is also recommended 6 to
12 months after surgery. Unlike after total
thyroidectomy, Tg testing isn’t helpful after
lobectomy.

Long-term monitoring
If follow-up test results are normal, it is
considered no evidence of disease (NED).
In those with NED, longer-term surveillance
includes physical exams, blood tests (TSH, Tg,
and Tg ab), and periodic neck ultrasound.

If there is no evidence of disease, longer-term
surveillance includes physical exams, TSH
blood tests, and neck ultrasound. Talk to your
care team about how often you need to have
ultrasounds.

If there is reason to suspect the cancer has
returned, you may have additional lab work,
additional neck ultrasounds, TSH-stimulated
testing (testing while thyroid hormone is
stopped), or imaging procedures such as CT
or MRI.

In addition to surveillance testing, a range of
other care is important for cancer survivors.

4 Papillary, follicular, and oncocytic carcinoma » Recurrence

Recurrence

Cancer that returns to the neck

Although the thyroid has been removed,
cancer can return to the neck or to areas
far from the neck. The return of cancer after
treatment is called recurrence.

If the cancer can be removed based on its
size and location, surgery is the preferred
treatment. For cancers that take up iodine,
treatment with RAI therapy will also be
considered.

Biomarker testing

But, treatment isn't always needed. If the
cancer isn't getting worse and isn't close to
any critical structures, your provider may
recommend close monitoring instead of
treatment.

Biomarkers are targetable features of a cancer.
Many are mutations (changes) in the DNA of
the cancer cells. For thyroid cancers with 1 or
more specific biomarkers, targeted therapy or
immunotherapy may be a treatment option if
needed.

If the cancer can't be removed with surgery,
doesn’t take up iodine, and is getting worse
(progressing), treatment with radiation therapy,
targeted therapy, or both may be an option.

Biomarker testing involves analyzing a piece
of tumor tissue in a lab or testing a sample
of blood. Testing for the following biomarkers
is recommended for recurrent, advanced, or
metastatic cancers that can't be treated with
RAI therapy:


ALK gene fusion



NTRK gene fusion



BRAF gene mutations



The preferred targeted therapy for cancer
that can’t be removed with surgery and is
progressing is lenvatinib (Lenvima). Another
recommended option is sorafenib (Nexavar).
If the cancer gets worse after treatment with 1
or both of these, cabozantinib (Cabometyx) is
recommended.
For cancers with certain gene mutations or
other features, biomarker-based therapy may
also be an option for recurrence. See Guide
1 on the next page.

medullary thyroid cancers)

Metastatic cancer

Guide 1
Biomarker-based treatment

Thyroid cancer that spreads to areas far from
the neck is known as metastatic. Metastatic
tumors can form anywhere but are most
common in the lungs, liver, muscles, bones,
brain, and spinal cord.
If the cancer takes up iodine, RAI therapy is
recommended to treat metastatic papillary,
follicular, or oncocytic thyroid cancers. Local
therapies, such as radiation therapy, may also
be used to treat areas of cancer directly.

If RAI therapy isn’t an option
If the cancer doesn't take up iodine, targeted
therapy may be an option. But, if the
metastatic tumors are growing slowly (or not at
all) and aren't causing symptoms, monitoring
the cancer may be a better option. Some
people live with their thyroid cancer for months
or years without needing treatment. You will
continue to take levothyroxine to keep your
TSH level down.

Local therapies
Small tumors can be treated directly using 1 or
more types of local therapy. If the cancer has
only spread to a limited number of sites, or has
spread to bone and/or is causing symptoms,
it may be possible to remove or destroy the
metastases with surgery and/or radiation
therapy.

To learn whether you are eligible for treatment
with a targeted therapy or immunotherapy,
biomarker testing is recommended. This
testing is described in more detail on page
30. Recommended targeted therapies for
metastatic cancer that can't be treated with
surgery or RAI are listed in Guide 1.

Ablation is another method used to treat
small bone tumors. In ethanol ablation, a
concentrated alcohol solution is injected into
the neck to kill cancer cells. Cryoablation
involves applying an extremely cold wand
directly into the tumor.

Other systemic therapies are available and
may be recommended if those listed in Guide
1 aren't available or appropriate. Joining
a clinical trial is strongly encouraged for
everyone with metastatic thyroid cancer.

delivers high doses of radiation to precise
areas to kill cancer cells.

If the cancer has spread to your bones,

bone-strengthening medications that can slow
damage caused by bone tumors and help
relieve symptoms.

If the cancer has spread to the brain or spinal
cord, treatment options may include surgery
to remove the metastases. Stereotactic

Papillary, follicular, and oncocytic
carcinoma are differentiated thyroid
cancers. Differentiated cancers tend to
grow and spread slowly. They usually
have good treatment outcomes.
Total thyroidectomy is an option for all
of the differentiated cancers. Lobectomy
may also be an option for small, low-risk
cancers.
Total thyroidectomy is recommended
for any cancer that has grown or spread
beyond the thyroid. RAI therapy may
follow.
After a total thyroidectomy, lifelong thyroid
hormone replacement therapy is needed.
Levothyroxine is almost always used.
Hormone replacement therapy isn’t
always needed after lobectomy, because
the remaining lobe of the thyroid is still
making hormones.
Recurrences are usually diagnosed
by lab or imaging studies and treated
with some combination of surgery, RAI,
EBRT, or systemic therapy. Treatment is
individualized.

somewhat differently than
differentiated thyroid cancers.

About 1 in 4 medullary thyroid cancers is
caused by a pathogenic variant (a change) in
the RET gene. These changes are also called
mutations.

Those with hereditary medullary thyroid cancer
are at risk for developing a type of adrenal
cancer called pheochromocytoma.

RET mutations can be passed from parent
to child (inherited). The hereditary form of
medullary thyroid cancer is known as multiple
endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2).

Testing

Compared to sporadic (non-inherited)
medullary thyroid cancer, the hereditary form
tends to start at a much younger age and
behave more aggressively. For this reason, the
thyroid may be removed at a very young age
in infants and children known to have a RET
mutation.

If a needle biopsy (fine-needle aspiration or
FNA) diagnoses medullary thyroid cancer, more
testing will be ordered. Genetic testing and
counseling, blood and lab tests, and imaging
procedures are used to help plan treatment.

Inherited medullary thyroid cancer also tends
to spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of
the body earlier and more often than nonhereditary medullary thyroid cancer. The
cancer can spread to the lungs, liver, or bones.

Everyone with medullary thyroid cancer found
by FNA should be tested for inherited (called
germline) mutations of the RET gene. Those
who have a RET mutation will be referred to a
genetic counselor.

There are different mutations of the RET gene.
Some are more likely to cause thyroid cancer
than others. Some are also associated with

explain what the results mean for members of
your family, including whether they should seek
testing for the same mutation.

The results of the testing described above
are used to determine the spread of cancer
in the body, also known as the cancer stage.
While the stage of medullary thyroid cancer
provides helpful information about the extent
and outlook of the cancer, it doesn’t guide
your treatment. This is because surgery is
recommended for all MTCs.

Seeing a genetic counselor is also encouraged
before having any testing performed. It can
help prepare you for the possible outcomes
and what they mean for you and your loved
ones.

Blood tests

In the early stages of medullary thyroid cancer,
the tumor has not spread beyond the thyroid.
A 2 cm or smaller tumor (about the size of a
peanut) is stage 1.

Before treatment, blood tests will be ordered
to measure the levels of calcitonin, calcium,
and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA
is a protein that can be found in the blood
of people with medullary thyroid cancer and
some other cancers. It may also be used to
check treatment results and monitor for the
return of cancer.

In stage 2 MTC the tumor is larger than 2
cm. It may have grown into muscles next to
the thyroid. In stage 3, cancer has spread to
nearby lymph nodes. The tumor itself may be
small or large.

Imaging

There are 3 categories of stage 4 medullary
thyroid cancer. Stage 4A is moderately
advanced disease. The tumor has grown
extensively into the neck, or has spread to
lymph nodes far from the thyroid.

If an ultrasound of the thyroid and neck hasn’t
yet been done, it is recommended before
surgery. Some people will also have an exam
of the voice box and vocal cords. This is called
laryngoscopy. A vocal cord exam may be
helpful in patients with voice changes, invasive
cancer, or bulky (large) cancer in the middle of
the neck. It may also be ordered in those who
have had surgery involving nerves near the
voice box.

Stage 4B is considered very advanced
disease. Although there is no cancer in nearby
lymph nodes, the tumor has invaded critical
areas or structures such as the spine, large
blood vessels, or the carotid artery.

Additional imaging is needed for metastatic
cancer. This may include computed
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography
(PET), bone scan, and whole-body MRI.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Thyroid Cancer, 2024

Stage 4C is the most advanced stage,
metastatic. The cancer has spread to areas of
the body far from the thyroid.

35

5 Medullary thyroid cancer » Treatment

Treatment

If the parathyroid glands are making too much
parathyroid hormone, one or more of the
glands may be removed during surgery. Some
or all of the tissue of individual parathyroid
glands may be removed.

Sporadic MTC
Sporadic (non-hereditary) medullary thyroid
cancer is treated with surgery to remove the
entire thyroid (total thyroidectomy). Depending
on the size and location of the tumor, the
surgeon may also remove nearby lymph
nodes that are known or suspected to have
cancer. This is known as neck dissection. Neck
dissection may not be needed for some tumors
smaller than 1 cm (about the size of a pea).

Parathyroid tissue can be removed and
transplanted into another area of the body,
such as the forearm. Over time, the tissue
begins to make hormones again. Parathyroid
gland tissue can also be frozen and stored
outside the body (cryopreservation). This
preserves the tissue so that it can be put back
into the body at a later date.

Levothyroxine is given after surgery to
replace the hormones no longer being
supplied by the thyroid. Hormone replacement
therapy is generally needed lifelong after
a thyroidectomy. See the next page for
information on what to expect after surgery.

Levothyroxine is given after surgery to
replace the hormones no longer being
supplied by the thyroid. Hormone replacement
therapy is generally needed lifelong after a
thyroidectomy.
MEN2B
Like MEN2A, MEN2B is treated using total
thyroidectomy. In infants known to have this
type of inherited medullary thyroid cancer, it is
recommended that the thyroid be removed by
age 1.

Hereditary MTC
Treatment of both forms of hereditary
medullary thyroid cancer (MEN2A and
MEN2B) is similar and is described next.
MEN2A
MEN2A, which includes familial thyroid cancer,
is treated using total thyroidectomy. In infants
or young children known to have this type
of inherited medullary thyroid cancer, it is
recommended that the thyroid be removed at
an early age. The timing of surgery is based
on the aggressiveness of the specific inherited
RET mutation.

In addition to the thyroid gland, any neck
lymph nodes known or suspected to have
cancer will be removed. Lymph nodes without
cancer may also be removed in order to
prevent cancer cells from spreading to them.
Levothyroxine is given after surgery to
replace the hormones no longer being

Lymph nodes near the thyroid may also be
removed during surgery. Reasons for removing
lymph nodes may include high calcitonin
or CEA levels before surgery, or abnormal
ultrasound results.

5 Medullary thyroid cancer » After surgery

After surgery
After a thyroidectomy, the best way to monitor
for the return of medullary thyroid cancer is
to check the levels of calcitonin and CEA
on a regular basis. The calcitonin level after
surgery is particularly important. The lower the
calcitonin level, the better.

When surgery is planned in a
child, thyroidectomy should be
performed by a surgeon and a
team experienced in performing
pediatric thyroid surgery.

The first blood test will take place 2 to 3
months after surgery. It is important to wait a
few months before testing because it takes
time for the calcitonin level to drop after the
thyroid is removed.

Normal blood test results

results show cancer, or if you are having
symptoms, see the next page.

If the first blood test after surgery does not
detect calcitonin and CEA is within normal
range, the cancer is likely cured. Going
forward, the calcitonin and CEA levels should
be measured every year. If either level begins
to rise, further testing and workup are needed.

If the imaging tests don’t find anything
concerning and you aren’t having symptoms,
you will be closely monitored. Blood
tests to measure calcitonin and CEA are
recommended every 6 to 12 months.
Depending on how quickly the levels are rising,
imaging procedures or more frequent testing
may be needed. Sometimes another surgery is
considered to remove remaining cancer.

In addition to annual calcitonin and CEA
testing, yearly testing for pheochromocytoma
is recommended for people with an inherited
medullary thyroid cancer (MEN2A or MEN2B).
In those with MEN2A, yearly testing for
hyperparathyroidism is also recommended.

Abnormal blood test results
If the first blood test after surgery finds
calcitonin, or if the CEA level is high, the
cancer may not have been completely
removed during surgery. Or it may have
returned or spread.
Your provider may order imaging tests of your
neck, liver, chest, and/or bones. If imaging

5 Medullary thyroid cancer » If cancer returns to the neck

If cancer returns to the neck
If MTC returns to the neck area, biomarker
(also called somatic) testing is recommended.
This testing looks for non-inherited gene
mutations and other features of the cancer.
In people without an inherited RET mutation
(or if this is unknown), testing the tumor
for somatic (acquired) RET mutations is
recommended.

Immunotherapy side effects
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have unique
side effects. Unlike other cancer treatments,
the side effects of immunotherapy occur
because the immune system is attacking
healthy cells in the body.

The cancer should also be tested for tumor
mutational burden-high (TMB-H), mismatch
repair deficiency (dMMR), and microsatellite
instability-high (MSI-H).

Learning to recognize possible side effects
can help you notice reactions early and
report them to your care team.

Treatment
Surgery is the preferred treatment for
medullary thyroid cancer that returns to the
neck area.

More information on the side effects of
immune checkpoint inhibitors is available
at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

If the cancer can’t be removed using surgery
and is causing symptoms or getting worse,
targeted therapy is often a treatment option. At

care can provide emotional, spiritual, and
social support.

Treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid
cancer depends in part on whether the
cancer is causing symptoms. If the cancer is
stable and isn’t causing symptoms, treatment
may not be needed. Surgery, ablation, or
other techniques to remove or destroy the
metastases will be considered.
If the cancer progresses (gets worse) and
begins causing symptoms, systemic therapy
is often a treatment option. The same targeted
therapies listed above are also preferred for
metastatic disease. If the preferred therapies
are not available or effective, other smallmolecule kinase inhibitors may be considered.
Chemotherapy that includes the drug
dacarbazine (DTIC) may also be an option.
Radiation therapy may be used to help with
symptoms, or as an ablative treatment in some
cases. Surgery, ablation, or other techniques
may be used to treat metastases in order to
relieve symptoms.
If the cancer has spread to bone, intravenous
bisphosphonates or denosumab are
recommended. These are bone-strengthening
medications that can help relieve symptoms
and slow damage caused by bone metastases.
Joining a clinical trial is strongly encouraged
for everyone with metastatic thyroid cancer.
Ask your treatment team if there is an open
clinical trial you might be eligible for.

Medullary thyroid cancer starts in the C
cells of the thyroid. The C cells make a
hormone called calcitonin.
About 1 in 4 medullary thyroid cancers
is inherited. Inherited medullary thyroid
cancer is known as multiple endocrine
neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). It is caused by
mutations in the RET gene.

We want your
feedback!
Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.

Everyone diagnosed with medullary
thyroid cancer using needle biopsy
should be tested for RET mutations and
offered genetic counseling. All medullary
thyroid cancers are treated with total
thyroidectomy.

Take our survey to let us know
what we got right and what we
could do better.
NCCN.org/patients/feedback

Blood tests to measure carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) and calcitonin are
recommended to monitor for the return of
medullary thyroid cancer.
Surgery is the preferred treatment for
cancer that returns to the neck. Other
options may include radiation therapy,
monitoring (no treatment), and targeted
therapy.
Surgery, radiation therapy, or other
techniques may be used to remove
or destroy metastases and relieve
symptoms.
Supportive care can help relieve
symptoms caused by medullary thyroid
cancer and its treatment.

biomarkers, is recommended for all anaplastic
thyroid cancers. Testing helps determine
whether you are eligible for treatment with
targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Testing
should include the biomarkers listed below.

Testing and staging
If a needle biopsy diagnoses anaplastic thyroid
carcinoma (ATC), more testing is needed to
confirm the diagnosis and learn the extent of
the cancer. Testing typically includes blood
tests and imaging procedures to see inside the
head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, voice box
(larynx), and airway (trachea).

Staging
The results of imaging are used to determine
the spread of cancer in the body, also known
as the cancer stage.
All anaplastic thyroid cancers are stage IV (4).
The letters A, B, and C are used to describe
how far the cancer has spread at the time it is
found.
Stages 4A and 4B are non-metastatic. If the
cancer is only in the thyroid, it is stage 4A. If
the cancer has grown into the neck or spread
to nearby lymph nodes, it is stage 4B.
Stage 4C is metastatic disease. The cancer
has spread to areas of the body far from the
thyroid, such as the lungs or bone.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Thyroid Cancer, 2024

6 Anaplastic thyroid cancer » Testing and staging

Stage 4A
In stage 4A anaplastic
thyroid cancer, the cancer
has not grown or spread
beyond the thyroid. The
tumor may be small or
large.

Stage 4B
In stage 4B anaplastic
thyroid cancer, the cancer
may have spread only to
nearby lymph nodes, as
shown here.

Non-metastatic ATC

If surgery isn’t an option
If the cancer can’t be safely removed
using surgery, EBRT is recommended.
Chemotherapy may be given in addition to
radiation therapy.

Non-metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer
includes stages 4A and 4B. Treatment
depends on whether the tumor can safely be
removed using surgery. If it can, the entire
thyroid is removed (total thyroidectomy).
Nearby lymph nodes known or suspected to
have cancer are also removed.

The cancer may be borderline resectable. This
means that surgery isn’t an option right away
due to the size and/or location of the tumor,
but it may become possible. In this case, if the
cancer has any of the biomarkers listed below,
your doctor may recommend treatment with
targeted therapy.

For cancers with a mutation in the BRAF
V600E gene, targeted therapy may be given
first to shrink the cancer before surgery. The
recommended regimen is dabrafenib (Tafinlar)
+ trametinib (Mekinist).

Recommended targeted therapies are listed
below by biomarker:

If surgery successfully removes all of the
cancer, or if only tiny amounts remain, external
beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is next. EBRT
kills microscopic leftover cancer cells in and
around the cancer site.





Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy in
addition to EBRT. When given with radiation,
some chemotherapy medicines make it easier
for radiation to kill cancer cells. This is called
radiosensitizing chemotherapy. Treatment
with both EBRT and chemotherapy during the
same time period is known as chemoradiation.



RET fusion-positive tumors: Selpercatinib
(Retevmo) or pralsetinib (Gavreto)
NTRK gene fusion-positive tumors:
Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) or entrectinib
(Rozlytrek)

After treatment with either radiation therapy
or targeted therapy, surgery may become an
option. This will depend on the size of the
tumor after treatment and other factors.

A 2- to 3-week recovery period is
recommended after surgery, before EBRT (and
possibly also chemotherapy) is started.

Metastatic ATC

Whether you choose to treat the cancer
aggressively or to maximize quality of life,
your doctor may suggest tracheostomy.
Tracheostomy is surgery to create an
opening (called a stoma) in the windpipe.
This surgery is typically done in an operating
room under general anesthesia. An incision
called a tracheotomy is made into the trachea
(windpipe). A curved tube is placed into the
newly created opening (the tracheostomy).
The tracheostomy tube provides an airway
used for breathing.

If anaplastic thyroid cancer spreads to distant
areas of the body, there may be more than one
approach to treatment. Some people choose to
treat the cancer aggressively. Others choose
to maximize their quality of life. Talk to your
care team about the approach that aligns with
your health and personal preferences.
Anaplastic thyroid cancer grows quickly and
can become quite large. Over time, the tumor
may block the airway or cause other airwayrelated problems. Hoarseness, noisy breathing
(stridor), and shortness of breath are possible
signs of a blocked airway.

The decision to have a tracheostomy, and
when, can be a difficult one for those with
ATC and their caregivers. Your care team can
provide information on the benefits and risks of

Guide 2

tracheostomy for you, taking into consideration
your cancer and goals.

Option: Aggressive treatment
If you and your care team decide on this
option, all of the following treatments may be
used together to fight the cancer:





Chemotherapy side effects

Total thyroidectomy and lymph node
dissection

Systemic therapy kills both cancer cells and
healthy cells. The damage to healthy cells
can cause hair loss, cracked skin, mouth
sores, and other side effects.

Radiation therapy
Systemic therapy with or without radiation
therapy (see Guide 2)

Managing side effects is a shared effort
between you and your care team. It is
important to speak up about bothersome
side effects, such as nausea and vomiting.
Ask about your options for managing or
relieving the effects of treatment.

Joining a clinical trial may be another option.
Participation in clinical trials is strongly
encouraged for all patients with metastatic
anaplastic thyroid cancer. Ask your treatment
team if there are any open trials that you may
be eligible for.

More information on supportive care is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient Guides for
Cancer app.

Option: Maximize quality of life
Aggressive treatment isn’t an option for
everyone with metastatic anaplastic thyroid
cancer. It may not be recommended for
health reasons, or it may not align with your
preferences. Everyone’s cancer and priorities
are different. For some, living as comfortably
as possible for as long as possible is preferred
to undergoing treatments that may change
your quality of life.

If anaplastic thyroid cancer has spread to
bones, denosumab (Prolia) or medications
called bisphosphonates may be given to help
strengthen your bones, slow bone damage,
and relieve symptoms caused by the tumors.

In this approach, the thyroid is not removed.
Surgery, radiation therapy, or both are used
to control cancer growth throughout the body.
Removing or destroying areas of cancer
directly can help relieve symptoms caused by
cancer in the neck or distant areas.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Thyroid Cancer, 2024

Supportive care plays an essential role in
the care of patients with anaplastic thyroid
cancer. See Chapter 7: Survivorship for
more information on the range of care that is
available and important for cancer survivors.

6 Anaplastic thyroid cancer » Important conversations

Important conversations

Hospice care can help with the physical and
emotional needs of anaplastic thyroid cancer.
See NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Distress
During Cancer Care, available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Important, often difficult, discussions are
needed after a diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid
cancer. These discussions can help with
making decisions about treatment and other
care.

Prognosis
Prognosis refers to the expected outcome or
course of an individual cancer. The prognosis
for most anaplastic thyroid cancers is poor,
meaning that good outcomes are unlikely.

Monitoring and
management

Discussing prognosis is an important part of
care planning for anaplastic thyroid cancer.
Your prognosis can affect the type and number
of treatments that you may be willing, or able,
to receive.

Imaging procedures (CT or MRI) of the brain,
neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis are needed
on a regular basis for metastatic anaplastic
thyroid cancer. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all
schedule for these scans. Talk to your treatment
team about how often you need imaging. A
combined PET/CT scan may be ordered 3 to 6
months after treatment of metastatic disease to
determine the extent of the cancer.

Weigh treatment options
Consider and discuss the goals of treatment
with your care team. Care to improve quality
of life may be more helpful than cancer
treatment. Talk to your doctor about your
treatment options. For example, controlling the
tumor growth may be preferred to aggressive
treatment. Participation in clinical trials is
strongly recommended for all patients with
anaplastic thyroid cancer. Talk to your treatment
team about clinical trials you may be eligible for.

If surveillance testing continues to find no
evidence of disease (NED), monitoring will
continue. Surgery, radiation therapy, or both
are used to control cancer growth throughout
the body. If the cancer returns or gets worse
(progresses), trying a different systemic therapy
may be an option. Joining a clinical trial is
strongly encouraged if one is available to you.

Palliative care
Supportive care is available for everyone with
anaplastic thyroid cancer. Supportive care
can provide relief from symptoms as well as
emotional, social, and spiritual support. Your
doctor may suggest hospice care during this
time.

In addition to surveillance testing, a range of
other care is important for cancer survivors. See

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the
least common and most aggressive type
of thyroid cancer.
All anaplastic thyroid cancers are stage
4. The letters A, B, and C are used to
describe how far the cancer has spread at
the time it is found. Stages 4A and 4B are
non-metastatic. Stage 4C is metastatic.

Supportive care is available for
everyone with cancer. It isn't
meant to treat the cancer, but
rather to help with symptoms and
make you more comfortable.

If surgery is possible, non-metastatic ATC
is treated with total thyroidectomy and
lymph node dissection. Radiation therapy,
and sometimes also chemotherapy, is
used to kill cancer cells remaining after
surgery.
If surgery isn’t an option, treatment
with radiation therapy (and possibly
chemotherapy) is recommended. If
the cancer has biomarkers, treatment
with targeted therapy may be an option
instead of radiation therapy.
For borderline resectable cancers,
shrinking the tumor with targeted therapy
or possibly immunotherapy may be an
option. If treatment with radiation therapy
or targeted therapy works well, surgery
may become possible.
Treatment of metastatic anaplastic
thyroid cancer may focus on maximizing
quality of life rather than treating the
cancer. Aggressive therapy includes total
thyroidectomy, radiation therapy, and
systemic therapy.
Supportive care is essential for everyone
with anaplastic thyroid cancer. It can help
relieve the side effects of cancer and its
treatment. It can also provide mental,
social, and spiritual care and support.

Dietary supplements

Get other recommended health care for
your age, such as blood pressure screening,
hepatitis C screening, and immunizations (like
the flu shot).

Eastern medicine
Medical marijuana
Herbal teas and preparations
Homeopathy

Diet and exercise

Hypnosis

Try to exercise for at least 150 minutes per
week. This will help you stay at a healthy body
weight.

Meditation
Reiki
Yoga

Alcohol may increase the risk of certain
cancers. Drink little to no alcohol. Eat a diet
rich in plant-based foods.

Massage therapy
If you have questions or are curious about
complementary therapies, talk to your
treatment team. Many cancer centers
have integrative oncology programs.
Integrative oncology is an approach to
cancer care that combines conventional

A hormone made by the C cells of the thyroid
gland. It helps control the calcium level in the
blood.

metastasis
The spread of cancer cells from the first tumor
to another body part.

chemotherapy
Drugs that work throughout the body to kill
cancer cells.

neck dissection
Removal of the lymph nodes and other tissue
in the neck area.

clinical trial
Research on an investigational test or
treatment to assess its safety or how well it
works.

nodule
A small mass of abnormal tissue.

computed tomography (CT)
A test that uses x-rays to view body parts.

noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm
with papillary‑like nuclear features (NIFTP)
A low-risk, noninvasive thyroid tumor. Formerly
known as encapsulated follicular variant of
papillary thyroid cancer.

contrast
A substance put into your body to make clearer
pictures during imaging tests.

Words to know

observation
A period of scheduled follow-up testing to
watch for signs of cancer spread (metastasis)
or return (recurrence).

stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
A special ablative radiation technique that
delivers high doses of radiation to precise
areas to kill cancer cells.

papillary thyroid cancer
The most common type of thyroid cancer.
Starts in follicular cells. Also called papillary
thyroid carcinoma (PTC).

thyroid
A gland located beneath the larynx (voice box)
that makes thyroid hormone and calcitonin.
The thyroid gland helps regulate growth and
metabolism.

parathyroid gland
One of 4 small glands near the thyroid that
make parathyroid hormone.

Thyrogen
A form of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
made in a lab. It is used to test for remaining
or recurring cancer cells in patients who have
been treated for thyroid cancer. Also called
thyrotropin alfa.

pathologist
An expert in examining cells and tissues to
diagnose disease.
pathology report
A document with information about cells and
tissues removed from the body and examined
with a microscope for disease.

thyroid hormone
Refers to the 2 main hormones made by the
thyroid: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine
(T3). The thyroid uses a mineral from your diet
called iodine to produce these hormones.

pituitary gland
A gland found near the base of the brain. It
makes hormones that control how other glands
in the body work or make hormones.

tumor
An abnormal mass of cells.
whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)
A type of external radiation therapy used to
treat cancer in the brain.

positron emission tomography (PET)
A test that uses radioactive material to see the
shape and function of body parts.
PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS)
An inherited syndrome that can cause follicular
thyroid cancer and other cancers and health
problems. Also called Cowden syndrome.
supportive care
Care given to improve the quality of life of
patients who have a serious or life-threatening
disease. Also called palliative care.
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
A non-surgical and highly precise type of
radiation therapy that can be used to treat
small brain or spine tumors.
