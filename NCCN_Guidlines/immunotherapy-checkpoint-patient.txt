About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities,
Version 1.2024 — December 7, 2023.

Overview

durvalumab (Imfinzi)
dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli)

The possible side effects of immunotherapy
range from mild to life-threatening. Doctors call
them immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
Most are manageable if found and treated early.

retifanlimab-dlwr (Zynyz)
CTLA-4 inhibitors
ipilimumab (Yervoy)

Unlike other cancer treatments, immunotherapy
side effects occur because the immune
system is attacking healthy cells in the body.
This is similar to what happens in people with
autoimmune disorders.

tremelimumab (Imjudo)
LAG-3 inhibitor
relatlimab (Opdualag)

Reactions can start during or after
immunotherapy. Some may worsen with each
dose. Side effects tend to be more severe
when treatment includes more than one type of
checkpoint inhibitor. Main types include:


PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors



CTLA-4 inhibitors



LAG-3 inhibitors

*approved at this time

How checkpoint inhibitors work
One job of the immune system is to spot
cancerous and other abnormal cells. There
are proteins on the surface of cancer cells
(such as PD-L1) that interact with proteins
on immune cells (such as PD-1). At these
meetings, the immune cell doesn't see the
cancer cell as a threat. Checkpoint inhibitors
block this interaction and allow the immune cell
to kill the cancer kill.

You will be monitored for side effects and to
see how treatment is working. Expect to have
lab tests and physical exams on a regular
basis. Tell your primary care doctor and other
care providers that you are taking a checkpoint
inhibitor.

Treating side effects

Side effects
Side effects of steroid therapy include:

Treating side effects is a team effort. Your care
team will work with specialists as needed to
guide your care. Some severe reactions may
require treatment at a specialized care center.
In many cases, the first step in managing
a side effect is to pause or discontinue
immunotherapy. This should be a shared
decision that you make with your provider after
talking it over.



Increased appetite



Weight gain



Mood changes



Retaining water



High blood pressure

Steroids can irritate the lining of the stomach.
This is called gastritis. If you take other
medications that also do this, your doctor may
prescribe you a medication to help prevent it.

Corticosteroids
Many side effects are treated with
corticosteroids (steroids for short). Steroids
reduce the activity of the immune system.
These are not the same as steroids used
to build muscle mass (anabolic steroids).
Steroids are not helpful for stopping or
reversing some effects, such as hormonerelated problems.

Steroids can raise blood sugar level. This is
a problem for people whose blood sugar is
already high due to diabetes or pre-diabetes.
Blood sugar monitoring and treatment may be
needed during steroid therapy.
Long-term treatment with steroids weakens the
bones. This is called osteoporosis. Vitamin D
and calcium can help prevent bone loss. Your
doctor may also recommend physical therapy
and weight-bearing exercises.

Prednisone and methylprednisolone are the
most commonly used steroids. The main
difference is that methylprednisolone comes in
an injectable form and can be put directly into
the bloodstream, rather than having to take a
pill.

Taking steroids for a long time can also cause
opportunistic infections. These are infections
that are more frequent or more severe in
people with weakened immune systems.
Depending on the steroid dose and how long
you take it, your provider may start you on an
antibiotic to prevent infections.

Steroids work best when started early. If you
notice any new or worsening symptoms, don't
wait to tell your care team.

Stopping steroids
Stopping steroids too quickly can cause
anxiety, sweating, nausea, and trouble
sleeping. Your care team will guide you as you
lower the dose slowly, over several weeks.
This is called tapering.

1 Immunotherapy basics » When steroids are not enough

When steroids are not
enough

Rituximab (Rituxan)
B cells are a type of immune cell that make
antibodies. While most antibodies are helpful
in fighting infection, sometimes B-cells make
antibodies that can attack organs such as the
thyroid gland. Rituximab kills B cells that have
a marker called CD20. It is given by IV.

Sometimes steroids are not enough and other
treatments that suppress the immune system
are needed. Those most often used are
described next. The choice of treatment will
depend on the problem and how severe it is.

Plasmapheresis

Infliximab (Remicade)

Plasma is the watery, light yellow part of blood
that contains antibodies and other proteins. In
this procedure, plasma is removed from your
blood and replaced with plasma from a donor.
It is also called plasma exchange.

Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
blocker. It blocks a protein in the immune
system that worsens immune attack.
Infliximab is given intravenously (put into
the bloodstream through a vein). It can reactivate tuberculosis and the hepatitis B virus.
Your blood will be tested for tuberculosis and
hepatitis B and C. If you are a hepatitis carrier,
you will be monitored during treatment and for
a few months afterward.

Methotrexate
Methotrexate is a type of medicine called
an antimetabolite. It slows down the
body's immune system. In people not on
immunotherapy, methotrexate is used most
often to treat inflammatory conditions (such as
rheumatoid arthritis) and some cancers.

Intravenous immunoglobulin
therapy (IVIG)
IVIG is an IV infusion of helpful antibodies
naturally made by the immune system. The
antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) come
from different people.

Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept)
This oral medication slows down the immune
system. It’s used for a range of autoimmune
problems. In people not on immunotherapy
it is used to prevent rejection after an organ
transplant.

1 Immunotherapy basics » After a severe side effect

After a severe side effect
Immunotherapy may be paused for certain
severe side effects. Restarting treatment with
the same checkpoint inhibitor isn't always
possible. This may be the case even for less
severe effects.

Immunotherapy Wallet Card

If you have the option of resuming your
checkpoint inhibitor after a severe side effect,
you will want to make an informed decision.
Discuss the benefits and harms with your care
team. If other cancer treatment is working, it
may not make sense to restart immunotherapy.
The anti-cancer benefits may not be worth the
risk of another severe problem.

Ask your care team for an
immunotherapy wallet card. This card
lists your immunotherapy regimen,
potential side effects, and contact
numbers for your cancer care team.
Carry it with you at all times. If a card is
not available, ask for a printable list of
your treatment regimen.

Communication is key

A printable card is available from
the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS)
website.

Stay in close contact with your care team,
especially the nurses. While many side effects
come on slowly, others can start and worsen
quickly. Reporting symptoms when they start
can help find problems early. It also helps
prevent severe complications. Symptoms that
seem unrelated, like diarrhea and shortness of
breath, could be signs of an irAE.

attention. Be sure to contact your care team
using the most efficient method.

If you need to go on steroids, the process of
tapering (slowly stopping) takes 4 to 6 weeks,
sometimes longer. During this time you will be
in close contact with your care team to monitor
your dose. The dose changes will be noted in
your record. This is important information used
to guide your care.
Ask your care team if there is a way to report
your symptoms online. Patient portals or
messaging systems can be an easy way to
communicate with your team. However, new
or worsening side effects may need urgent

Immunotherapy uses the immune system
to kill cancer cells.

Check point inhibitors can have
some pretty serious side effects.
My husband had some really awful
ones. But when these drugs
work, they really work. When I
asked him if he’d do it again if
needed, his response was
‘in a heartbeat!’"

Immune checkpoint inhibitors cause
immune cells to attack cancer cells.
Sometimes they also attack healthy cells.
This causes side effects called immunerelated adverse events (irAEs).
Most side effects are treated with steroids
(prednisone or methylprednisolone).
Side effects of steroids include increased
hunger, weight gain, mood changes,
retaining water, and high blood pressure.
Steroids are stopped by slowly lowering
the dose over 4 to 6 weeks. This is called
tapering.
Other immune-suppressing treatments
may be needed for side effects that do not
improve with steroids.
Stay in close contact with your care team.
Ask if you can contact them online using
a patient portal or messaging system.

Skin problems are common during

Rash

treatment with a checkpoint

A rash that has both flat patches and bumps is
common during immunotherapy. Doctors call
this a maculopapular rash. It often starts in the
area between the hips and shoulders (the torso)
and grows outward. You might also have other
symptoms like itching, burning, or tightness.
Blistering rashes are more serious than
maculopapular rashes and should be reported
to your care team right away (see next page).

inhibitor. Most are mild and can
be managed without stopping
immunotherapy. While rare, very
serious skin reactions can occur.

Using an emollient is recommended for
everyone with a rash. These ingredients found
in skin care products soothe, moisturize, and
protect the skin from irritation. They are also
called barrier creams.

Skin
Immunotherapy-related skin issues usually
start in the first few weeks of treatment. If
you develop symptoms of a skin problem,
your doctor will do a full-body skin exam. This
includes:


The inside of the mouth



Hair and scalp



Fingernails and toenails

For a rash affecting a small area (less than
30 percent) of the body, immunotherapy can
be continued. You will be prescribed a topical
steroid to apply at home. Topical means it
is applied to the top of the skin. It could be
a cream, ointment, lotion, or gel. If the rash
is itchy, your doctor may prescribe an oral
antihistamine to see if it helps relieve the
itching.

The goal is to find all problem areas and
learn how much of the body is affected. Your
provider may take pictures of the problem
areas to track healing. If you have a history of
skin problems, tell your care team. In this case,
seeing a dermatologist on a regular basis is
recommended.

A rash covering more than 30 percent of
the body that is interfering with basic selfcare, such as bathing, is considered severe.
Immunotherapy will be paused. Your doctor
will consult with a dermatologist right away.
In-hospital care may be needed. A tiny piece of
inflamed skin may be removed and tested (a
biopsy). Treatment with both a topical steroid
and systemic (oral or intravenous) steroids is
recommended.

Your provider will ask about your symptoms
and how much they are affecting your normal
activities and self-care. They may order blood
testing for a severe drug reaction syndrome
that causes fever, rash, and swelling of
the face and hands. Depending on your
symptoms, a small piece of tissue may be
removed for testing (a skin biopsy).

Blisters

Treatment with systemic (oral or IV) steroids
will be started. If there is no improvement,
your doctor may add treatment with rituximab
(Rituxan) or dupilumab (Dupixent). Intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be given with
either of these for severe blistering. In-hospital
care is needed for severe or life-threatening
blistering. Immunotherapy will be stopped.

A blister is a fluid-filled sac in the outer layer
of skin. Blistering is a medical emergency,
especially when it affects the mouth or
genitals. It may be a sign of a rare and serious
disorder in which the outer layer of skin
separates from the connective tissue beneath
it. Your doctor will consult with a skin expert
(dermatologist) right away.

Itching

The contents of an unbroken blister are usually
removed and tested. It is also common to
have blood tests to look for specific antibodies
(proteins).

Itching (pruritus) is also common, with or
without a rash. The itching may be constant or
may come and go. Oral antihistamines (allergy
medicines) are recommended to help lessen
itching. Using a fragrance-free moisturizer
all over the body can also help relieve and
prevent itching.

For blistering in one small area with no
other symptoms, your doctor will prescribe
a high-strength topical steroid. It should be
applied to all inflamed and blistered areas.
Immunotherapy may be paused until all
blisters have healed.

For mild itching in a small area, you will be
prescribed a medium-strength topical steroid.
Your provider may also suggest an over-thecounter pain and itch relief cream.

For blistering affecting a larger area of
the body, immunotherapy will be paused.

Itching is common during
immunotherapy. Treatment
with a topical steroid is
recommended for mild and
moderate rashes. An oral
antihistamine can help
relieve the itching.

2 Skin and mouth » Skin

Lichen planus

More intense or widespread itching that
comes and goes is considered moderate.
There are often skin changes from picking and
scratching, such as lesions, bumps, swelling,
oozing, crusting, or thickening of the skin.
Your provider will prescribe a high-strength
topical steroid. Immunotherapy will be paused
until there is improvement. They may also
prescribe gabapentin or pregabalin. These
oral drugs can help relieve itching. If there is
no improvement, light therapy (called narrowband ultraviolet B [UVB] phototherapy) will be
considered.

Lichen planus is a condition that can affect the
skin on the body or the inside of the mouth. On
the skin it causes reddish-purple bumps and
patches that are usually itchy. Inside the mouth
it causes erosions (shallow indents) in mouth
tissue. Intersecting fine white lines and dots
can often be seen.
Treatment with either a tacrolimus-based
ointment or a high-strength topical steroid
is recommended. The steroid is often a gel
for the mouth, a solution for the scalp, and a
cream, lotion, or ointment for other affected
areas.

For itching that is constant and intense or
widespread, immunotherapy will be paused.
Treatment with systemic (oral or IV) steroids
will be started. Your provider may also
prescribe gabapentin or pregabalin. If there is
no improvement in about a month, you may
be prescribed dupilumab (Dupixent). This is
a biologic medicine given under the skin by
injection.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Immunotherapy Side Effects:
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, 2024

Depending on how much of the body is
affected, treatment with a systemic (oral or
IV) steroid may also be needed. For severe
lichen planus covering more than 30 percent
of the body, your doctor will also consider
treatment with other types of anti-inflammatory
medicines. If available, your provider may
recommend narrow-band ultraviolet B (UVB)
light therapy.

Psoriasis and related diseases

If a larger area of the body is affected,
immunotherapy will be paused. You will start
treatment with a high-strength topical steroid
and a vitamin D cream or ointment, such
as calcipotriene. Treatment with one of the
following may be added:

Psoriasis shows up as thick, red, and scaly
patches on the skin. It occurs most often in the
following areas:


Around the joints



On the scalp





Around the navel (belly button)





Behind the ears

If only a small area of the body (less than
10 percent) is affected, immunotherapy can
usually be continued. Your doctor will prescribe
a high-strength topical steroid and a vitamin D
cream or ointment, such as calcipotriene.

apremilast (Otezla)
acitretin (not for people of childbearing
age)



cyclosporine



methotrexate

You will be referred to a dermatologist to see
if treatment with a biologic is an option. These
protein-based drugs target specific parts of the
immune system. Biologics are made in a lab
from living cells. They are given by injection or
through a vein.
If available, narrow-band UVB light therapy
may also help with moderate or severe
psoriasis.

UVB light therapy
Narrow-band UVB light therapy may
help improve psoriasis or lichen
planus that hasn't responded to
other treatment.

2 Skin and mouth » Mouth

Mouth

Inflamed mucosa
Immunotherapy can cause your mouth to
become sore and inflamed. Symptoms of an
inflamed mucosa include irritated gums or
throat, mouth sores, and lichen planus. Lichen
planus is described earlier in this chapter.

The moist, inner lining of the mouth is called
the (oral) mucosa. Symptoms can include:


Dry mouth



Mouth pain



Irritated mouth, gums, and/or throat



Mouth sores or blisters



Changes in mouth tissue



Sensitive gums or teeth



Changes in taste

If you only have some food restrictions,
your symptoms are considered mild. You
can continue immunotherapy. Reducing the
amount of acid your stomach makes can help.
Treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or
a histamine-2 (H2) blocker is recommended.
You will also be prescribed a high-strength
topical steroid. This may be a liquid that you
swish around your mouth, or a gel applied to
affected areas. Magic mouthwash can also
help. This mouth rinse is a mixture of 3 things:

Your provider will examine your mucosa,
gums, jaw, tongue, and teeth. They will ask
about your symptoms, and whether you’ve had
to change what you normally eat and drink.
Your doctor may remove a small piece of
tissue from your lip or inside your mouth. They
may also use a cotton swab to collect samples
from areas of concern. The sample will be
tested for fungal and viral infections.

An anesthetic (relieves pain)



An antihistamine (relieves inflammation)



An antacid (helps the other ingredients
coat the mouth)

For more severe symptoms, immunotherapy
will be paused. Treatment with both a topical
and systemic (oral or IV) steroids is needed. If
you can’t eat at all, you will be admitted to the
hospital.

Depending on your symptoms, making
changes to your diet may help. Avoid crunchy,
spicy, acidic, or hot food/drinks as needed for
comfort.
Try to maintain good oral hygiene. An
oral rinse that contains chlorhexidine is
recommended. This medicine kills or prevents
the growth of bacteria in your mouth. It also
reduces swelling and irritation of the gums.
If available, your doctor may refer you to a
specialist. This could be a dermatologist, oral
medicine specialist, dentist, or ear, nose, and
throat (ENT) doctor.

2 Skin and mouth » Mouth

Dry mouth

Mouth pain

Also called sicca syndrome, dry mouth is
common during immunotherapy. It’s caused
by the immune system attacking the glands
that make saliva. Steroids may help a little, but
long-term care for the lack of saliva is usually
needed.

Mouth pain is also possible during
immunotherapy. It is often described as a
burning feeling. It may occur alone or with
other symptoms. People often report that the
pain seems worse than it should given any
other symptoms.

Blood tests for specific antibodies (proteins)
can help diagnose sicca syndrome. Your
provider will also check to see if you’re taking
any medicines that worsen dry mouth.

Your care team will rule out other possible
causes of the pain. They will check for problems
of the jaw and/or teeth, such as an infection
or abnormal growth. They will also inspect the
tongue and all of the skin inside the mouth.

If your symptoms are mild and you don’t need
to change your normal eating habits much, you
can continue immunotherapy. Try to drink more
fluids and limit caffeine intake. Even taking
small sips of water throughout the day can help.

Treatment with a topical steroid is one option.
This will likely be a gel, a dental paste, or an
elixir that you swish and hold in the mouth.
Viscous lidocaine is another option. This
numbing mouth rinse helps relieve pain and
swelling in the mouth and throat.

Saliva substitutes and moisture-preserving
mouth rinses, toothpastes, and sprays are
recommended. Sugarless chewing gum,
lozenges, or candy can also help your mouth
make more saliva.

If the pain is mild and isn’t affecting your
eating or drinking habits, you can continue
immunotherapy. For more severe symptoms,
immunotherapy will be paused. Your doctor will
also consider treatment with gabapentin.

For more severe symptoms, immunotherapy
will be paused. Treatment with an oral steroid
will be started. Your doctor will also prescribe a
cholinergic agonist. These are oral medicines
that increase the amount of saliva in the
mouth. If you are unable to eat at all, you will
be admitted to the hospital.
Saliva protects your teeth. Not making enough
saliva can lead to cavities and tooth loss.
Your doctor may refer you to a dental health
specialist to help avoid these problems.

Fatigue (tiredness) is a common side
effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Severe fatigue could be a sign of a
hormone problem. Urgent testing and
treatment may be needed.
Fatigue can be an early sign of a heart
problem. Prompt evaluation can prevent
severe complications. Hospitalization may
be needed if a heart problem is found.
Evaluating fatigue includes a physical
exam, blood tests, and a medication
review.
Your doctor may make changes to your
medications to see if it lessens your
fatigue.
Lifestyle changes can help with fatigue.
Hydration, diet changes, and practicing
good sleep habits are recommended.
Immunotherapy can be continued for mild
fatigue but may be paused if it becomes
more severe.

this does not typically cause
symptoms.

Treatment

Diarrhea and inflamed bowel

Depending on your baseline habits, mild
symptoms may mean 1 to 3 bowel movements
above normal per day and no colitis symptoms.
Anti-diarrheal medications can help. Try
to drink more fluids than usual. If needed,
your doctor may prescribe mesalamine
and/or cholestyramine. Mesalamine is an
anti-inflammatory drug taken by mouth.
Cholestyramine is most often used to lower
cholesterol but can also relieve diarrhea. Try
to avoid foods with lactose. A BRAT (bananas,
rice, apple sauce, toast) diet may help make
stools firmer and less frequent.

Diarrhea, or having more bowel movements
than usual, is common during immunotherapy.
The lining of the colon (large bowel) can
also become inflamed. This is called colitis.
Symptoms include:


Watery stools



Cramping



Urgency



Abdominal pain



Blood (if severe) or mucus in stool



Fever



Nighttime bowel movements

Immunotherapy is usually paused for more
severe symptoms. Depending on your starting
habits, this could mean at least 4 bowel
movements above normal per day along with
colitis symptoms. Treatment with systemic (oral
or intravenous) steroids is needed. If there
is no improvement, an infusion of infliximab
(Remicade) or vedolizumab (Entyvio) may
be given. Based on the response, you may
receive additional doses. If these treatments
don't help, other immune-suppressing drugs
will be considered.

Everyone’s baseline (starting) bowel habits are
different before immunotherapy. It's good to
know yours, as it is often the changes in your
habits that are important. Knowing how often
you have a bowel movement (per day or every
1 to 2 days) and the consistency of your bowel
movements can help you know what your
baseline bowel pattern looks like.

Hepatitis

Key points

The liver is a large organ located on the right
side of the body, under the rib cage. It filters
blood and helps digest food by making a
substance called bile.





The levels of substances (enzymes) made
by the liver will be checked using blood tests.
High levels may be a sign that the liver is
inflamed or damaged. This is called hepatitis. It
doesn't usually cause symptoms.





Some drugs can damage the liver. Taking
too much acetaminophen (Tylenol), for
example, can cause liver injury. Certain dietary
supplements and alcohol use can also damage
the liver. Your doctor will review all of your
medications and supplements. Use of drugs
that may harm the liver will be avoided or
limited. Others will be adjusted based on how
well your liver is working.





If liver enzyme levels get too high, treatment
with steroids is needed. Immunotherapy
may be paused. If there is no improvement,
mycophenolate mofetil may be added. It is an
immune-suppressing drug.



Bilirubin is a yellow substance in blood. Liver
problems can cause it to build up in blood. If
bilirubin and liver enzyme levels are very high,
liver failure could occur. In-hospital care is
needed.

Diarrhea and inflamed bowel (colitis) are
common side effects of immunotherapy.
Diarrhea is an increase in bowel
movements, which may be watery.
Symptoms of inflamed bowel include
watery stools, bleeding, mucus, cramping,
urgency, abdominal pain, and fever.
Anti-diarrheal medication and staying
hydrated can help relieve mild symptoms.
Avoiding lactose and/or starting a BRAT
diet may make stools firmer and less
frequent.
Mesalamine or cholestyramine may
be added for mild symptoms that don't
improve with anti-diarrheal medication.
More severe bowel symptoms are treated
with steroids. Infliximab or vedolizumab
may be added if needed.
Immunotherapy can cause the liver to
become inflamed (hepatitis). This doesn't
usually cause symptoms. If liver enzyme
levels become too high, treatment with
steroids is needed.

Sensitivity to the cold

You will be prescribed a medicine that replaces
thyroid hormone. It is called levothyroxine.
It is taken as a pill once a day. Determining
the right dose for you can take some trial and
error.

Hormones are substances that travel in blood.
They regulate many important body functions.

Thyroid
The thyroid is a gland in the neck. It makes the
hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine
(T3). Together they are often called just
“thyroid hormone.” Thyroid hormone helps
many organs function properly (such as your
heart and gut) and helps regulate metabolism
and body temperature. Thyroid hormone levels
will be checked with blood tests before and
during immunotherapy.

Thyroiditis
Painless irritation of the thyroid gland caused
by immune system attack is called thyroiditis.
First, hormone levels rise. This doesn't usually
cause symptoms. If it does, you may have
weight loss, fatigue, sweating, or anxiety. If you
have symptoms, your doctor may prescribe
a beta-blocker. This type of drug blocks the
effects of stress hormones on the heart.
After 4 to 6 weeks, thyroid hormone levels
may drop, but may also return to normal.

replacement therapy may be temporarily
increased. Wearing a medical alert bracelet is
recommended for this pituitary problem.

The pituitary is a gland in the brain. It makes
hormones that control other glands and body
functions. If the pituitary becomes inflamed, it
does not make enough of certain hormones.
The problems that can result are described
below. Permanent damage to the pituitary can
occur.

Rarely, the level of cortisol can become
dangerously low. This is known as an adrenal
crisis. In-hospital care is needed. Symptoms of
adrenal crisis are listed in Guide 2.

Central hypothyroidism

Testing for pituitary problems includes blood
tests and sometimes magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the brain.

This is a rare form of underactive thyroid. In
this type the level of thyroid hormone is too
low due to a problem with the pituitary or
hypothalamus. The symptoms are the same
as those normally seen with underactive
thyroid. Weight gain, constipation, dry skin,
and sensitivity to cold are most common.
Your doctor will prescribe levothyroxine. This
medication replaces thyroid hormone.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency
This condition occurs when the pituitary
doesn't make enough adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH). As a result, glands on top
of the kidneys (adrenal glands) do not make
enough cortisol. Cortisol helps the body
respond to stress, fight infection, and regulate
blood sugar. The most common symptoms of
low cortisol due to pituitary damage include:


Fatigue



Loss of appetite



Muscle weakness

Guide 2
Adrenal crisis symptoms
Severe fatigue
Nausea/vomiting
Low blood pressure

Secondary adrenal insufficiency is managed
with medication to replace the hormones
not being made by the body. This includes
hydrocortisone tablets to replace natural
cortisol. They may be needed for the rest of
your life. Your doctor will determine the lowest
dose needed to prevent symptoms.

Confusion
Feeling sleepy or tired
Headache*
Increased sensitivity to light*

Normally, the adrenal glands make much more
cortisol at certain times. This happens when
there is infection, illness, injury, or trauma to
the body. In these cases your dose of hormone

is also needed if you have symptoms of a
diabetic emergency, described next.

The pancreas is a gland behind the stomach.
One of its jobs is to make a hormone called
insulin. Insulin absorbs glucose (sugar)
into cells for use as energy. If the pancreas
becomes inflamed or damaged, it does not
make enough insulin. This is type 1 diabetes. It
is a rare side effect of immunotherapy.

Diabetic ketoacidosis
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a blood sugar
crisis. It occurs when blood sugar becomes
very high. Fat is broken down too quickly and
toxic acids build up in the blood and urine. It
can be life-threatening if insulin is not received.
Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:

Type 1 diabetes requires daily insulin therapy
for life. Living with diabetes can be hard but
managing it has come a long way. There are
new ways to monitor and manage blood sugar.
Many people find continuous glucose monitors
(CGM) to be an easy way to check blood sugar.
Blood tests are used to monitor for
type 1 diabetes. Your blood sugar level
will be checked each time you receive
immunotherapy. Further testing will be ordered
if the blood sugar level is too high. Testing

The pancreas
The pancreas is a large
gland behind the stomach.
During immunotherapy the
immune system can attack
the pancreas. This causes
damage that affects
hormone levels.

Thyroiditis is painless damage to the
thyroid gland. Thyroid hormone levels
often rise before dropping too low,
causing symptoms such as weight gain,
dry skin, and constipation. A medicine that
replaces thyroid hormone is used to treat
underactive thyroid.
Symptoms of low cortisol due to pituitary
damage include fatigue, loss of appetite,
and muscle weakness. It is treated
with hydrocortisone tablets. An adrenal
crisis can occur if cortisol gets very
low. Symptoms include severe fatigue,
nausea/vomiting, and headache.
Type 1 diabetes is a rare side effect that
requires lifelong treatment with insulin.
A diabetic emergency can occur if blood
sugar becomes too high. Symptoms
include vomiting, confusion, abdominal
pain, and fast heart beat.

severe cases. Your provider is likely to swab
the inside of your nose to detect viruses, such
as the flu and COVID-19. They may also order
tests of your phlegm (mucus), blood, and
urine.

No symptoms
Pneumonitis that doesn’t cause symptoms but
can be seen on imaging tests is considered
mild. Your doctor may recommend briefly
pausing immunotherapy until a repeat chest
CT (with contrast) is done. You will likely have
a follow-up visit in 1 to 2 weeks to see if there
is improvement.

Another test that can help rule out infection
is bronchoscopy. This minimally invasive
procedure allows your doctor to see inside
your lungs. A thin, flexible camera with a tiny
light is guided through your nose or mouth and
into your lungs. A small amount of sterile saline
(saltwater) is flushed through the tube to rinse
a small part of your lungs. The saline is then
suctioned back through the tube and sent to a
lab for testing. This is called a bronchoalveolar
lavage. It is typically done with some medicine
to make you comfortable during the procedure.
If there is a chance that cancer has spread to
the lungs, your doctor may perform a small
lung biopsy during bronchoscopy.

Mild or moderate symptoms
Symptoms of pneumonitis include shortness
of breath, cough, fever, and chest pain. If
you have symptoms, immunotherapy will be
paused. You will have some or all of the tests
previously described. Until infection has been
ruled out, you may be prescribed an antibiotic.
Treatment with steroids will be started. Your
doctor will check your symptoms and oxygen
saturation about every 3 to 7 days.

Bronchoalveolar lavage
During a bronchoscopy, a small amount of sterile
saline (saltwater) may be put into the lungs. The
saline washes the airway and is then suctioned
back through the tube. The fluid is tested for

Immunotherapy can cause joints,

Inflammatory arthritis is not the same as
osteoarthritis, which is caused by use of a joint
over many years. Also, inflammatory arthritis
often affects joints throughout the body, rather
than just one or two. Symptoms include:

tendons, ligaments, bones, and
muscles to become inflamed.
This chapter describes these side
effects and their treatment.

Blood tests can provide helpful information
about muscle and joint problems. Your provider
will order blood tests based on the suspected
problem. Tests often ordered for these
conditions include:


C-reactive protein (CRP)



Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)



Rheumatoid factor (RF)



Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)

Stiffness in the morning
Stiffness after rest that improves with
activity

Your doctor will examine the painful or swollen
joints to see how they function. In addition
to blood tests, you may have imaging of
the affected joints. Your provider may also
consult with a specialist in arthritis and similar
conditions (a rheumatologist).
Options for treating inflammatory arthritis are
described next. Severe arthritis can lead to
permanent joint damage. If your symptoms are
disrupting your daily habits and imaging tests
show joint erosion, immunotherapy may be
paused.

NSAIDs
If only 1 joint is affected or if pain is mild,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
are used to help relieve symptoms. Ibuprofen
(Advil), aspirin, and naproxen (Aleve) are
NSAIDs. Your provider may suggest treatment
with celecoxib (Celebrex). It is a newer type of
NSAID called a COX2 inhibitor.

Inflammatory arthritis is not a single disease.
It is a group of disorders caused by immune
attack on joints. Major types include:

7 Muscles and joints » Muscle weakness and pain

Muscle weakness and pain

will be increased. If still no improvement,
treatment with a DMARD (described next) will
be considered.

Immunotherapy can cause muscle weakness,
called myositis. Myositis most often affects
muscles in the neck, upper arms, shoulders,
hips, and thighs. There may also be muscle
pain (myalgia).

DMARDs
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
(DMARDs) reduce the signs and symptoms
of rheumatoid arthritis and can slow tissue
damage. DMARDs include methotrexate,
sulfasalazine, leflunomide (Arava), and
hydroxychloroquine. Blood tests are needed to
see if you are eligible for a DMARD.

Muscle strength testing can help find nervous
system problems that may be causing the
weakness. Your doctor may also order
electromyography (EMG) or MRI of the
affected muscle(s). EMG measures muscle
and nerve function.

Biologics

For milder symptoms, you will be prescribed
an oral steroid. You will have blood tests on
a regular basis to check the levels of creatine
kinase and aldolase.

In some cases, treatment with a biologic will be
considered. Biologics are made in a lab from
living cells. These protein-based drugs target
specific parts of the immune system. They are
given by injection or through a vein.

For severe or life-threatening symptoms,
immunotherapy will be paused. You will be
admitted to the hospital. Treatment with
intravenous steroids will be started. For
symptoms that don't improve with steroids,
treatment with one of the following may be
added:

Other medications
For severe symptoms that haven’t improved
with other treatment, a TNF inhibitor or an
IL-6 inhibitor may be considered. Infliximab
(Remicade) is a TNF inhibitor. IL-6 inhibitors
include tocilizumab (Actemra) and sarilumab
(Kevzara).

Polymyalgia rheumatica

PMR is closely related to another condition
called giant cell arteritis, described next. Many
people who have one of these also have
symptoms of the other.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a disorder
that causes muscle aches, pain, or stiffness.
The shoulders and hips are most often
affected. The symptoms often come on quickly
and are worse in the morning.
Blood and lab tests are used to gather more
information. If your provider suspects PMR
based on your symptoms, you may have an
ultrasound of your shoulders, hips, or both.
PMR is treated with oral steroids. If there is
no improvement, your steroid dose may be
increased and immunotherapy paused. If
symptoms persist, treatment with a DMARD
or an IL-6 inhibitor may be added. You may be
referred to a specialist for further care.
When your symptoms are gone, steroids will
be tapered over 6 to 12 weeks (maybe longer).

rheumatologist will decide if an IL-6 inhibitor
(such as tocilizumab or sarilumab) is a good
option for you.
When your symptoms are gone, steroid
therapy will be tapered extra slowly. The
tapering period for GCA is at least 8 to 12
weeks.

Changes in behavior
Headaches
Seizures

Symptoms include pain, muscle weakness in
the legs (sometimes the arms), and sensory
problems. Bladder and bowel problems are
also common. In-hospital care is needed.
Treatment with IV steroids will be started. If
your symptoms don't improve or get worse,
IVIG or plasmapheresis may be added.

muscle, support and recover heart function,
and prevent the myocarditis from recurring.

Heart and blood vessel side effects are rare,
but can come on quickly and become very
severe.

Damage to the heart muscle can lead to
changes in heartbeat. Electrical defibrillation
treatment and/or a pacemaker may be needed.
This small device is implanted in the chest. It
helps the heart to function. It may be needed
permanently.

Myocarditis
The heart muscle may become inflamed. This
is called myocarditis. The heart becomes
bigger (swollen) and weaker. Severe cases
can lead to heart failure and changes in
heartbeat. In people not on immunotherapy,
myocarditis is usually caused by infection.

Other heart and blood vessel
problems
The outer lining of the heart (pericardium) can
become inflamed. This is called pericarditis.
Fluid can build up around the heart (pericardial
effusion) and may need to be removed.

Symptoms include:


Fatigue



Chest pain or pressure



Very slow, very fast, or irregular heartbeat



Shortness of breath



Swollen legs, ankles, or feet



Lightheadedness

Inflammation of blood vessels (arteries and
veins) is also possible. This is called vasculitis.

If you have symptoms you will be examined
by a heart expert (cardiologist or cardiooncologist). You will have testing to look for
heart and blood vessel problems. The goal is
to find heart problems early and learn if they
are due to immunotherapy or other heart or
blood vessel diseases. You may be admitted
to the hospital for closer monitoring, for more
testing, or for treatment.
Myocarditis is treated first with high-dose IV
steroids. If there is improvement, you will be
switched to oral steroids. Steroids will then
be slowly stopped (tapered) and replaced
with other medicines. During steroid tapering
you will be monitored very closely. The goal
is to reverse immune attack against the heart

serious. Immunotherapy may be paused.
Treatment with steroid eye drops, steroid eye
injections, or an oral steroid is recommended.

A number of symptoms can signal an eyerelated side effect. See Guide 4.

Episcleritis

If you have symptoms or vision changes, your
doctor will refer you to an ophthalmologist for a
complete eye exam. This eye expert will guide
your care. Certain infections and diseases can
cause eye problems. Your provider will order
blood tests to rule out these and other possible
causes of your symptoms.

The episclera is a thin layer of clear tissue
that covers the white of your eye. If this layer
becomes inflamed it doesn't usually affect
eyesight. Treatment is not always needed.
Artificial tears can help with symptoms.
immunotherapy is typically continued for mild
inflammation. If there are changes in eyesight,
immunotherapy may be paused. Treatment

Over-the-counter eye drops (artificial tears)
can help with dryness and irritation. These
saline (salt)-based drops moisturize and
soothe the eyes. Contact lenses and eye
makeup can make symptoms worse. Try to
avoid these and other irritants.

Guide 4
Eye and vision symptoms
Blurred/distorted vision

Steroid eye drops are often all that is
needed for mild symptoms. More severe
symptoms may require steroids and pausing
immunotherapy.

Blind spots
Change in color vision

Uveitis

Sensitivity to light

The layer of tissue beneath the white of the
eye is called the uvea. It has 3 parts. When
any of these parts is inflamed, it is called
uveitis. If not treated, serious problems such
as blindness can occur.

Tenderness or pain
Eyelid swelling
Bulging eyes

The part of the uvea that most often becomes
inflamed is the iris. This is the colored ring
around the pupil. Immunotherapy will be
paused for iritis (also called anterior uveitis).
Treatment with steroid drops is recommended.
An oral steroid may also be prescribed.

Red or purple discoloration of the eye
New floaters
Itchy eyes
Eye redness

Inflammation of the back of the uvea or of all
three parts is less common. It is also more

typically continued. Artificial tears can help with
symptoms.

Scleritis

If there are changes in eyesight,
immunotherapy may be paused. Treatment
may include steroid eye drops, an oral steroid,
or a topical antibiotic.

The sclera is the white of the eye. It protects
the eye and helps maintain its structure. When
the sclera is inflamed it is often painful. Other
symptoms include eye tenderness, redness,
and swelling.

Maculopathy
Maculopathy is damage to the center part of
the retina, called the macula. It causes blurry
central vision. Central vision is important. It’s
what you use to read, drive, and recognize
faces. Immunotherapy will be paused, even
for mild symptoms. Treatment for maculopathy
may include steroid eye drops or an oral
steroid.

Scleritis is considered mild if it does not affect
vision. Mild scleritis is treated with an oral
NSAID. Systemic (oral or intravenous) steroids
are needed for scleritis that is causing vision
changes. Immunotherapy may be paused.

Keratitis
The clear tissue on the front of the eye (the
cornea) can also become inflamed. This
is called keratitis. It does not usually affect
eyesight. Treatment is not always needed. If
the inflammation is mild, immunotherapy is

If you have symptoms or vision
changes, your doctor will refer
you to an ophthalmologist
for a complete eye and vision
exam. Examination with a
microscope with a bright light
(a slit lamp) is a key part of a
complete exam.

8 Less common side effects » Kidneys » Pancreas

Kidneys

Pancreas

The kidneys remove waste and extra water
from blood. One substance that gets filtered
out is creatinine, a waste product of muscles.
The level of creatinine in your blood and
protein in your urine will be checked during
immunotherapy. A high level of creatinine
signals that the kidneys aren’t working well.

The pancreas does more than make
hormones. It also makes substances that
help digest food. These are called enzymes.
When inflamed or injured, liver cells leak more
enzymes than normal into the bloodstream.
Blood tests are used to check enzyme levels
during immunotherapy. If the levels go up a
little, any symptoms are usually mild and may
include:

Causes other than immunotherapy will be
considered. Certain medicines can damage
the kidneys if taken at a high dose for a long
time. Your doctor will review your medications
and make any needed changes.



Nausea



Bloating

Acute kidney injury



Burping

Acute kidney injury occurs when the kidneys
suddenly stop filtering blood. This kidney crisis
comes on quickly, usually in less than a few
days. Wastes build up and disrupt blood’s
chemical makeup. Symptoms include:



Pain in abdomen



Back pain



Making less urine



Swollen legs, ankles, or feet



Shortness of breath



Fatigue



Confusion



Nausea



Chest pain or pressure

No treatment is needed.
High levels, however, signal that the pancreas
is under immune attack. It becomes very
inflamed over a very short period of time. This
is called acute pancreatitis.
If this is suspected, imaging with CT and
sometimes a special type of MRI will be
ordered. If confirmed, in-hospital care is
needed. Treatment involves oral or intravenous
steroids and intravenous fluids.

In severe cases, seizures or coma are
possible. In-hospital care may be needed.
Treatment with steroids will be started. You
may first have a kidney biopsy. Immunotherapy
will be paused.

Immunotherapy can cause rare but
serious problems affecting the nervous
system, heart, kidneys, eyes, and
pancreas.

Immunotherapy side effects can
start even after treatment is over.
Stay alert for new symptoms
for at least 1 year after finishing
immunotherapy.

Symptoms of a nervous system side
effect can include muscle weakness,
confusion, headaches, sensitivity to light,
changes in behavior, and seizures.
Heart and blood vessel side effects are
rare but serious. Symptoms include
worsening fatigue, chest pressure or pain,
shortness of breath, heartbeat changes,
and swelling in the lower body.
Eye changes during immunotherapy
can include dryness, pain, tenderness,
redness, swelling, and vision changes. An
ophthalmologist will guide your care.
Symptoms of acute kidney injury include
making less urine, lower body swelling,
shortness of breath, fatigue, confusion,
and nausea.
High levels of substances made by
the pancreas can be a sign of acute
pancreatitis. This rare side effect requires
in-hospital care.
