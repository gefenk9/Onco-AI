About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Bladder Cancer, Version 4.2024 – May 9, 2024.

What is bladder cancer?

you understand your diagnosis

Bladder cancer is a disease that occurs when
cells in the inner lining of the bladder grow out
of control. The bladder is a hollow, balloonlike organ that stores urine. It’s located in
your pelvis—the area between your hip bones
in your lower abdomen. The bladder’s inner
lining, called the urothelium, prevents urine
from leaking back into the body.

of bladder cancer. It will also
explain your options for treatment.
Taken together, you’ll have the
confidence to make well-informed
decisions about what’s best for
you. This may reduce some of the
fear and worry.

What does the bladder do?
• The bladder is a hollow organ in
the lower pelvis. Its main job is
to store urine (pee). In adults, the
bladder can hold up to 2 cups of
urine.
• Urine is made by the kidneys
and flows down to the bladder
through two tubes called ureters.
• The bladder gets bigger as it fills
with urine and gets smaller when
you pee. It’s about the size of an
orange when empty and the size
of a grapefruit when full.
• When you urinate, the muscles in
the walls of the bladder contract.
This forces the urine out of the
bladder and through a tube
called the urethra, which streams
it out of the body.
• Together, these organs are called
the urinary tract.

1 Bladder cancer basics » About bladder cancer

Bladder cancer happens when abnormal
(cancer) cells develop genetic errors
(mutations) that cause them to make many
more cancer cells. Cancer cells also avoid
normal cell death. As cancer cells increase,
they crowd out and overwhelm normal cells.
Over time, the cancer cells may form a tumor
in the bladder. Sometimes the cells grow
deeper and invade the bladder’s muscle
layer. The cancer may even break through the
bladder and spread to other parts of the body.

Other (non-urothelial) types of bladder cancer
are much less common. These include
squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma,
and small cell carcinoma.

Is bladder cancer common?
Bladder cancer is one of the most common
cancers in adults. Most people who have
bladder cancer are aged 55 years and over.

How is bladder cancer found?

Bladder cancer is often found at an early
stage when the cancer is highly treatable.
However, bladder cancer commonly comes
back again even after treatment. In many
cases, bladder cancer comes back in a
different place and sometimes more advanced
than before. That’s why follow-up testing is
so important. People with bladder cancer
need regular follow-up tests for many years to
check if the cancer has returned.

Bladder cancer is usually found when a person
has symptoms. A symptom is a problem or
feeling that may signal a disease or condition.
The most common symptom of bladder cancer,
and the one that usually appears first, is
having blood in your urine (hematuria).
How does blood get into urine? Bladder tumors
are likely to release a little blood, which mixes
with the urine in your bladder. The blood may
turn your urine pink or bright red. Or, if there
isn’t enough blood to be visible, your urine
may look normal. But your clinical team can
still detect blood by looking at a sample of the
urine under a microscope.

The most common kind of bladder cancer
starts in the urothelial cells, which are stretchy
cells that line the inside of the bladder.
Urothelial cells also form the inner layer in
the rest of the urinary tract, which includes
the kidneys, the ureters, and the urethra.
Cancer of the urothelium can start in these
areas instead of the bladder, although it’s less
common.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Blood in the urine can be caused by many
other things besides bladder cancer. The most
common cause is an infection in the urinary
tract. So anyone with blood in their urine
should see a health care provider to get their
urine tested.

6

1 Bladder cancer basics » About bladder cancer

Other symptoms of bladder cancer include:


Frequent urination



Urgency to urinate



Painful urination



Back pain

What does aggressive
mean?
When health care professionals describe
cancer as aggressive, they mean the
cancer is likely to grow or spread more
quickly than average.

Not every person with bladder cancer will have
all these symptoms. Some people will have no
symptoms.

Aggressive can also be used to describe
a treatment that’s stronger or more
intense than other treatment options.

A person with one or more of these symptoms
should visit a doctor or other health care
provider who can recommend different tests.
These tests are used to make a diagnosis. (A
diagnosis means identifying an illness by using
tests.)

Bladder cancer
Bladder cancer is often described
by how far it has spread into the
muscle layer of the bladder.
Here, the cancer tumor has grown
through the inner lining (urothelial
layer) and invaded the muscle
layer in the bladder wall. This type
of cancer is known as muscleinvasive bladder cancer.

Some people reading this book may have
already been tested and given a diagnosis of
bladder cancer. For those who haven’t been
diagnosed yet, the only way to make sure you
have bladder cancer is to have tests that:




However, only some individuals with these
genetic mutations go on to develop bladder
cancer.

What are the risk factors for
bladder cancer?

Look inside your bladder (cystoscopy and
imaging)

A risk factor is something that increases your
chance of developing a disease. Risk factors
don’t necessarily cause bladder cancer. But
people with bladder cancer often have one or
more of these risk factors:

Study your urine (urinalysis and cytology)
Analyze a sample of surgically removed
bladder tissue (resection and biopsy)

We’ll talk about these and other tests in
Chapter 2.



What causes bladder cancer?
Many people wonder why they got cancer.
Cancer experts don’t know exactly what
causes bladder cells to grow out of control.
What they do know is that bladder cancer and
other cancers start with abnormal changes
(mutations) in the genes of cells.





Genes are tiny parts of a cell that carry the
instructions for how cells behave. These
instructions also control how new cells are
made. Sometimes, mutations can mix up these
instructions. This can turn normal cells into
cancer cells.



In most people with bladder cancer, these
mutations aren’t passed down in families
(hereditary mutation). They happen on their
own and only in cancer cells. Still, you may
have a higher risk for bladder cancer if another
family member also had bladder cancer.
In rare cases, mutations in these genes can
be passed down in families. This results in
an increased risk of getting bladder cancer.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Smoking – Smoking is the greatest risk
factor for bladder cancer. It accounts
for about half of all cases. Secondhand
smoke increases bladder cancer risk, too.
Quitting smoking, even after diagnosis,
can still be helpful.
Age – The risk of bladder cancer
increases as you age.
Family history – Your risk increases
if you or anyone in your family has had
bladder cancer. Also, people with an
inherited condition called Lynch syndrome
have a greater risk of cancer in the
urinary tract, including bladder cancer.
Chemical exposure – Some chemicals
used in dyes, rubber, leather, printing
materials, textiles, and paint products
have been linked to an increased risk for
bladder cancer.

How advanced is my bladder
cancer?

What’s the best treatment for
bladder cancer?

Once bladder cancer is found, it’s important to
know how far it has grown or spread. Bladder
cancer advances in 3 phases:






There’s no single treatment that’s best for
everyone. The best treatment for bladder
cancer is the treatment that’s best for you.
You’ll work with your treatment team to choose
which option makes the most sense for you.
This choice is based on your cancer stage
as well as your overall health and personal
preferences.

Non–muscle-invasive bladder
cancer has grown on or in the bladder’s
inner layer of urothelial cells, but not into
the bladder’s muscle layer.
Muscle-invasive bladder cancer
has grown through the bladder’s inner
urothelial layer and into its muscle layer.
But it hasn’t grown anywhere else.

Very often, the best option includes more than
one type of therapy. Common treatments for
bladder cancer include:

Metastatic bladder cancer has
spread outside the bladder to other areas
of the body. Common areas of metastatic
bladder cancer include the lymph nodes,
bones, lungs, liver, and the inner wall of
the abdomen. (Lymph nodes are small,
bean-shaped glands that transport a fluid
called lymph and help fight infection.
Lymph nodes are found around the
urinary tract and all over the body.)



Surgery



Chemotherapy



Immunotherapy



Radiation therapy



Targeted therapy

Surgery, by itself or with other treatments, can
be used in many stages of bladder cancer.
For less advanced cancer, a minor surgical
procedure can be used to remove just the
tumor. For more advanced cancer, the entire
bladder can be surgically removed.

Treatment is different for each of these three
phases of bladder cancer. These phases are
further divided into stages, which are explained
in Chapter 3.

In addition, you may receive chemotherapy
or immunotherapy directly into the bladder.
For people with metastatic bladder cancer,
chemotherapy or immunotherapy is used to
treat cancer anywhere in the body. Another
treatment option is to join a clinical trial.
You’ll also receive treatment for any side
effects caused by cancer therapy.

Can bladder cancer be cured?

Even so, there’s hope. If the cancer does
come back, it can be treated. Many people
live with bladder cancer and still have a good
quality of life.

Bladder cancer in an early (non-invasive)
stage can usually be cured. Treatment for
more advanced stage (muscle-invasive)
bladder cancer can be complicated but it may
still get rid of the cancer.

Plus, new and improved ways to detect and
treat bladder cancer are helping people live
longer and with fewer side effects than ever
before.

Metastatic bladder cancer is not typically
curable, but it is still treatable. And treatments
are improving all the time. For most people
with bladder cancer, treatment provides a
longer and more comfortable life with fewer
symptoms.

Experts predict that treatment will improve
rapidly over the next few years, with better
results for all stages of bladder cancer.

It’s important to know that bladder cancer
commonly comes back even after treatment.
In fact, bladder cancer is more likely to come
back than almost any other kind of cancer.
From now on, you and your health care
providers will have to keep watching for any
sign that the cancer returns.

As a result of clinical trials,
many new treatments for bladder
cancer have been approved or
are on the horizon. As always,
you can try to join a clinical
trial at almost any point during
cancer care.

diagnose and treat bladder cancer.
This chapter explains these tests
and what to expect when being
tested.

Physical exam

Before you can be treated, you’ll need several
tests to confirm your diagnosis. These tests
measure how much the cancer has grown and
how quickly it’s growing. Tests are also used to
plan treatment, to find out how well treatment
is working, and to check if the cancer comes
back after treatment.

A physical exam is a check of your body for
any signs of disease. Your health care provider
may feel for abnormalities or tenderness in
your abdomen and pelvis.

Blood and urine tests

This chapter describes what tests you may
have and what to expect during testing. Bring
someone with you to listen, ask questions, and
write down the answers.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and how
well organs are working. A blood test requires a
sample of your blood, which is removed through
a needle placed into your vein. One sample
may be used for several different blood tests:

Tests and procedures that you may receive are
described next. Not everyone will need all of
these tests.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and
platelets in your blood. Your doctor will want
to know if you have enough red blood cells
to carry oxygen throughout your body, white
blood cells to fight infection, and platelets to
control bleeding.

General health tests
Medical and family histories
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you’ve had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Also, put together
a list of your prescription medications and
any over-the-counter medicines, herbals, or
supplements you take. Tell your doctor about
any symptoms you have.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures important chemicals, proteins, and
other substances in your blood. Levels that
are too high or low could be a sign of a health
problem in areas like the kidneys or liver.

2 Tests for bladder cancer » Blood and urine tests

Who’s on your multidisciplinary care team?
Treating bladder cancer takes a team
approach. Some members of your care
team will be with you throughout your
cancer treatment, while others will be
there for parts of it. Your team should
communicate and work together to bring
the best knowledge from each specialty.
This is called multidisciplinary care.
Depending on your diagnosis, your
multidisciplinary team may include a dozen or more specialists and care providers:
Your primary care doctor handles medical
care not related to your cancer. Your primary
doctor can help you express your thoughts about
treatments to your cancer care team.

A diagnostic radiologist reads the results
of x-rays and other imaging tests.
An anesthesiologist gives anesthesia, a
medicine so you don’t feel pain during surgery
or procedures.

A urologist is an expert in the urinary system
and the male reproductive organs.

Advanced practice providers are
an important part of any team. These are
registered nurse practitioners and physician
assistants who monitor your health and provide
care.

A urologic oncologist is a surgeon who
diagnoses cancers of the urinary tract and the
male reproductive organs, and treats the cancer
using surgery and intravesical therapy.
A medical oncologist treats cancer using
systemic therapies such as chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. A medical oncologist will often
coordinate your care with other team members.
If not, ask who will coordinate your care.

Residents and fellows are doctors who
are continuing their training, some to become
specialists in a certain field of medicine.
Nutritionists offer guidance on what foods
or diet are most suitable for your particular
condition.

A radiation oncologist prescribes and
plans radiation therapy to treat cancer.

Psychologists and psychiatrists are
mental health experts who help manage issues
such as depression, anxiety, or other mental
health conditions that affect how you feel.

Oncology nurses provide your hands-on
care, like giving systemic therapy, managing
your care, answering questions, and helping
you cope with side effects.

Genetic counselors are experts who
interpret how your family history may impact
your treatment.

A pharmacist prepares chemotherapy and
other medicines, and can offer treatment advice.

2 Tests for bladder cancer » Cystoscopy and biopsy

Some important tests in a CMP are:




to identify some of these specific tumor cells.
Scientists call these biomarkers.

Liver function test looks at
enzymes made by the liver, like alkaline
phosphatase and bilirubin.

At this time, biomarker tests may provide some
helpful clues about bladder cancer, but aren’t
quite reliable enough to diagnose it. Biomarker
tests are also sometimes used for surveillance
in people who’ve been treated for non–muscleinvasive bladder cancer. Surveillance means
watching to see if the cancer comes back after
it has been treated or removed.

Kidney function test measures waste
products like creatinine and blood urea
nitrogen (BUN) to check if your kidneys
are working normally. This test can be
very helpful for deciding your treatment.

Urine cytology

Cystoscopy and biopsy

Urine cytology is a lab test that analyzes your
urine for any cancer or precancerous cells. You
may receive a urine cytology test if you have
blood in your urine.

Cystoscopy is a procedure to look inside your
urethra and bladder for any sign of cancer.
This procedure uses a cystoscope, a tube
with a camera and a light at the end, which is
inserted into the urethra and through to the
bladder.

A urine cytology is done like other urine tests—
you pee into a small plastic container. Or,
your urologist may collect a sample of your
urine during cystoscopy. Either way, the urine
sample is sent to a lab for testing. At the lab,
a pathologist (a doctor who examines cells
and tissue to find disease) uses a microscope
to look for any abnormal cells in your urine
sample.

Cystoscopy may be done at your urologist’s
office, a hospital, or a clinic. The procedure
takes only a few minutes, doesn’t require
general anesthesia, and you can go home
afterward.
During a cystoscopy
You’ll lie on your back on an exam table. You
may be positioned with your feet up and your
knees apart. After lubricating your urethra (and
possibly numbing it with an anesthetic gel),
your urologist will slowly insert the cystoscope
into the opening of the urethra. This opening
is at the tip of the penis or just in front of the
vagina. This may be uncomfortable at first but
it shouldn’t be painful. The cystoscope will
move through the urethra and into the bladder.

If abnormal cells are found, it means that
cancer may be located anywhere in the urinary
tract. You’ll need a cystoscopy procedure to
find out if it’s in the urethra or the bladder. If
cancer isn’t found in the urethra or bladder,
you’ll need imaging tests to investigate the
ureters, kidneys, or other areas.

Urine tests for tumor markers
Tumors shed cancer cells somewhat like a
dog sheds hair. These cancer cells can end
up in your urine. Urine tests are now available
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

The urologist will view a monitor that shows
real-time images of the inside of the bladder.
15

2 Tests for bladder cancer » Cystoscopy and biopsy

If any areas appear suspicious, the urologist
may use a small tool on the cystoscope to
remove tiny tissue samples for testing (biopsy).
If a biopsy can’t be done during this visit, you
might be scheduled for a separate procedure
on another day.

In addition to biopsy samples, the urologist can
completely remove very small cancer growths
during the cystoscopy. However, if a tumor is
found, you’ll need to have it removed in an
operating room at a clinic or hospital. This
procedure is further explained in Chapter 4.

Cystoscopy
A cystoscopy is an exam to look inside the urethra and bladder for any signs of cancer.
If anything looks suspicious, the urologist can use a small tool on the cystoscope to
remove tiny tissue samples for testing (biopsy).
A flexible cystoscope (upper left) is used for viewing and biopsy. A rigid cystoscope
(bottom right) is more invasive, but it can also remove small tumors.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

16

2 Tests for bladder cancer » Imaging

In a very similar exam, called a ureteroscopy,
the cystoscope goes a little farther to examine
the upper parts of the urinary tract—the ureters
and inner kidneys. A ureteroscopy is done only
if something seems abnormal with the ureters
or kidneys.

Is blue light cystoscopy better?
Cystoscopy commonly uses a white light
to see inside the bladder. Some newer
cystoscopes now use a blue light. When
combined with a special dye injected into
the bladder, blue light cystoscopy can
identify tumors a little more distinctly than
white light. Another technology called
narrow-band imaging also helps detect
tumors more clearly during cystoscopy but
doesn’t require a dye.

After a cystoscopy
After the procedure, you may have one or
more of these side effects:





Bleeding from your urethra, which can
appear bright pink in your urine or on
toilet paper
A burning sensation during urination
Urinating more often for the next day or
two

While both blue light cystoscopy and
narrow-band imaging may potentially detect
tumors better than standard white light,
they’re relatively new and still in the “testing
phase.” More research will show whether
they can replace or be used with white light
as the standard detection method.

If a tissue sample was taken for a biopsy, it will
be sent to a lab and tested for cancer.

Imaging
Imaging means taking detailed pictures
(images) of the insides of the body. The
images can show the size, location, and other
features of cancer. Imaging can reveal where
the cancer started and whether the cancer has
spread (metastasized).

Types of imaging include x-rays, computed
tomography (CT), positron emission
tomography (PET), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), and ultrasound.

After your scan, your images will be studied
by a radiologist. A radiologist is a doctor who’s
an expert in interpreting imaging tests. The
radiologist will send the results to your doctor
or care team.

CT scan
A CT scan takes many x-rays of the same
body part from different angles. A computer
combines all the x-ray pictures to make a
series of cross-sectional images.

This information helps to plan the next steps
of your care. Your doctor or other health care
provider will discuss the results with you. Be
sure to ask any questions you have.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

To look for cancer that has spread beyond
the bladder, you may have a CT scan of your
abdomen and pelvis. The pelvis is the area of

bones; it contains reproductive organs as well
as the bladder and rectum.

can be done with one or two machines,
depending on the cancer center.

MRI

A CT scanner is a large machine that has a
tunnel in the middle. During the test, you’ll
lie on a table that moves slowly through the
tunnel. Pillows or straps may be used to help
keep you still during the test.

MRI uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of the inside of the body. An
MRI is used to get a more detailed view of
cancer within the bladder or urinary tract. It’s
also used to see if cancer has spread to the
liver, nearby lymph nodes, or the bones in your
pelvis.

PET/CT scan
A PET scan uses a radioactive drug injected
into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the
body. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on
PET scans.

Like a CT scanner, an MRI is a large machine
with a tunnel in the middle. Unlike CT, MRI
doesn’t use radiation (x-rays). An MRI also
makes much more noise and takes longer than
a CT scan. Tell your team if you get nervous
in small spaces. You may be given a sedative
(medicine) to help you relax. You’ll need to
remain as motionless as possible during each
scan. You may be positioned with pillows or
bolsters to help you keep still.

When a PET scan is combined with CT,
it’s called a PET/CT scan. PET/CT creates
detailed images that are useful in certain
clinical situations for finding cancer that has
spread outside the bladder. A PET/CT scan

2 Tests for bladder cancer » Imaging

Because an MRI uses magnets, you can’t
bring any metal objects (such as a cell phone,
wristwatch, belt with a metal buckle, or jewelry)
into the imaging room.

Tips for testing
Results from blood tests, imaging
studies, and biopsies will be used to
determine your treatment plan. It’s
important you understand what these
tests mean. Ask questions and keep
copies of your test results. Online patient
portals are a handy way to access your
test results.

Other types of imaging
CT and MRI are commonly used to see how
far bladder cancer has spread. Other types of
imaging are sometimes used to look for cancer
in other parts of the urinary tract or other parts
of the body:






Urogram uses a contrast solution
and either CT or MRI to see how well
your entire urinary tract is working. The
contrast makes the lining of your kidneys,
ureters, and bladder easier to see. You
may have a urogram if you’re feeling
symptoms such as pain in your side or
back, or if you have blood in your urine.

Follow these tips for testing:

3 Bring someone with you to doctor
visits, if possible.

3 Write down questions and take

notes during appointments. Don’t
be afraid to ask your care team
questions.

Renal ultrasound shows your kidneys,

these tests. (Ask your care team or go to

For bladder cancer, the most common
germline mutations are found in these genes:
CDKN2A, FGFR3, PIK3CA, ERBB2. If you
have an inherited risk, your cancer might
require additional testing or specialized
treatment.

The goal of this type of genetic testing is to
look for germline (inherited) mutations that
occur in every cell in your body. Germline
testing may be more appropriate for people
who have:

Already had cancer



A close relative with bladder cancer



Age below 50



Cancer of the upper urinary tract



High grade (fast growing) cancer



Quitting smoking
Smoking increases the risk for bladder cancer.
People who smoke are 3 times more likely to
die from bladder cancer than people who don’t
smoke.
The more you smoke, the greater your risk.
Your family and friends could also have a
greater risk because your secondhand smoke
may increase their risk for bladder cancer, too.

Lynch syndrome or a family member with
Lynch syndrome

If you have one or more of these factors, you
should ask about genetic counseling. A genetic
counselor is an expert who has special training
in genetic diseases and can help you decide
whether to have germline testing. The test is
done using a sample of your blood, saliva,
urine, or tumor tissue. A genetic counselor

Tests of your blood and urine can show
if something in your body isn’t working
right. This may be a clue that you have a
serious illness, such as cancer.

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit
If you smoke tobacco or use e-cigarettes,
it’s very important to quit. Smoking or
vaping can limit how well cancer treatment
works. Smoking greatly increases your
chances of having side effects during
and after surgery. It also increases your
chances of developing other cancers.

Cystoscopy uses a viewing device
inserted through the urethra to look for
cancer inside the bladder.
Imaging tests can show whether cancer

3 Staging and grading » How far and how fast?

The stage and grade of your



cancer represent how far and how
fast your cancer has grown. Your
care team needs to know the stage
and the grade of your cancer to
predict the course of your disease



and to make a treatment plan.

How far and how fast?

Grade measures the overall
aggressiveness of the cancer. It’s an
estimate of the rate that the cancer is
growing. Cancer grade is either low grade
(slow) or high grade (fast).

It’s important for your care team to know the
stage and the grade of your cancer to predict
the course of your disease and to make a
treatment plan.

You’ve had many tests to learn about your
cancer. But before you receive treatment, your
care team needs to figure out how far your
cancer has grown and how fast it’s growing.
This is done with staging and grading.

The next chapters explain how these ratings
are used to choose treatments. But first, let’s
get to know more about staging and grading.

Layers of the bladder
The wall of the bladder
has four main layers.
From the inside to the
outside, they are:
• Inner lining (urothelial
layer)
• Connective tissue layer
• Muscle layer
• Outer fatty layer

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Stage measures the physical extent of
the cancer. It’s a number rating of how
far the cancer has grown into the bladder
wall. Numbers range from 0 to 4, where 0
means no growth into the bladder and 4
means it has grown through the bladder
wall and out to other parts of the body.

23

3 Staging and grading » Stage

Stage

An important thing about bladder cancer is
whether the tumor has or hasn’t grown into the
bladder muscle. Cancer in stage 0 and stage
1 haven’t grown into the muscle layer (non–
muscle-invasive). Cancer in stages 2, 3, and
4 have grown into the muscle layer (muscleinvasive). Cancer that has invaded the muscle
layer needs more intense treatment.

Staging is a way to describe how much cancer
is in your body, how much it has grown, and
how far it has spread. If the cancer has spread
outside the bladder (metastasized), staging
describes where it has spread to and whether
it’s affecting other parts of the body.
Staging uses your test results to identify and
locate your cancer. Staging helps you and your
care team select the best therapy.

Stage 0
Stage 0 is the earliest stage of bladder cancer.
This stage of cancer affects only the inner
lining of the bladder (urothelial layer). Stage 0
has two subgroups:

There are five stages of bladder cancer: 0, 1,
2, 3, and 4. Some stages are also divided into
subgroups.



You may see the cancer stage written with a T,
where the T stands for tumor: T0, T1, T2, T3,
and T4.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

24

Stage 0a describes cancer cells that
grow from the inner lining toward the
hollow center of the bladder, rather than
into the bladder wall.

3 Staging and grading » Stage



Stage 0is stands for carcinoma in situ
(CIS). This is a flat patch of cancer cells
that hasn’t grown any farther than where
it started. It’s still on the surface of the
bladder lining and has yet to invade
deeper layers. However, carcinoma in situ
is fast-growing, aggressive, and can be
very serious.



Stage 4
Stage 4 cancer has grown through the bladder
wall and may have spread to lymph nodes or
organs far from the bladder. Stage 4 has two
subgroups:

Stage 1
Stage 1 has grown through the inner lining
of the bladder wall and into the layer of
connective tissue. But stage 1 hasn’t invaded
the muscle layer of the bladder wall (non–
muscle-invasive).





Stage 2
Stage 2 bladder cancer has grown into the
muscle layer (muscle-invasive), but it hasn’t
reached the fatty layer covering the outside of
the bladder nor has it spread anywhere else.

Stage 3
Stage 3 has grown through the bladder
wall and into the fatty layer surrounding the
bladder. It may also have spread to lymph
nodes and organs nearby (in the pelvis). Stage
3 has two subgroups:


Stage 3A bladder cancer may only be
in the fatty tissue surrounding the bladder
or it may have spread to a single nearby
lymph node. It may also invade nearby
reproductive organs such as the prostate
gland, uterus, or vagina. Stage 3A cancer
has not spread to nodes or organs that
are far from the bladder.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Stage 3B has the same traits as stage
3A but has spread to multiple lymph
nodes in the pelvis. Stage 3B cancer has
not spread to lymph nodes or organs far
from the bladder.

25

Stage 4A has invaded the wall of the
pelvis or abdomen. Or, it has spread to
lymph nodes far from the bladder.
Stage 4B has spread to far away lymph
nodes and organs like the bones, liver,
or lungs. Stage 4B is metastatic bladder
cancer.

The next piece of information used to plan
treatment is the cancer grade. The grade
measures how aggressive the cancer is. It’s
a rating of how fast the cancer will likely grow
and spread.

The inner lining of the bladder is made of
urothelial cells. Most cases of bladder cancer
start in the urothelial cells. So this type of
cancer is called urothelial cancer.
But in rare cases, urothelial cell cancer has
features that look like other types of cells.
These are referred to as subtypes. Some of
them include:

To figure out the grade, a sample of your tumor
will be studied in a laboratory by a pathologist.
The pathologist will compare the cancer cells
to normal cells. The more different they look,
the higher the grade. And the higher the grade,
the faster the cancer is expected to spread.




LG means that the cancer cells are low
grade (slow growing).
HG means that the cancer cells are high
grade (fast growing).



Glandular subtype



Squamous cell subtype



Micropapillary subtype



Plasmacytoid subtype



Sarcomatoid subtype



Nested subtype



Lymphoepithelioma-like subtype



Microcystic and tubular subtype

It’s important to investigate whether you have
one of these or another subtype. In general,
treatment for these uncommon subtypes is
similar in the early stages to treatment for
typical urothelial cancer. However, some
subtypes might grow or advance faster than
typical urothelial cell cancer. And faster
growth might mean it needs more aggressive
treatment.

The stage of cancer describes how deep
it has grown into the bladder wall and how
far it has spread. Cancer stage is used to
determine which tests and treatments will
help you receive the best outcome.

Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.

Bladder cancer at stage 0 and stage 1
haven’t invaded the muscle layer. Stage
0 means that abnormal cells have grown
on the inside lining of the bladder. Stage
1 means that a tumor has formed and has
invaded the layer of connective tissue in
the bladder wall.

Stages 2, 3, and 4 bladder cancers are
muscle-invasive. The tumor has invaded
the muscle layer of the bladder wall.
In stage 3 bladder cancer, the tumor
has grown into the fat layer around the
bladder. There may also be cancer in
nearby lymph nodes.
Stage 4 is metastatic bladder cancer.
This is cancer that has spread outside the
bladder and to distant sites in the body.
Cancer grade is an estimate of how fast
the cancer is expected to grow. Low
grade bladder cancer is slow growing.
High grade cancer grows more quickly.

4 Treatment options for bladder cancer » Surgery

This chapter explains the different



treatment options for bladder
cancer. Many people with bladder
cancer receive more than one
type of treatment. Together, you



and your care team will choose a
treatment plan that’s right for you.

Types of surgery for bladder cancer include
tumor removal and bladder removal.

Tumor removal
For bladder cancer, a surgical procedure
called a resection removes the tumor but
leaves the rest of the bladder in place. The full
name of the procedure is called a transurethral
resection of bladder tumor (TURBT, sometimes
pronounced tur-bit).

There are several ways to treat bladder
cancer. It’s likely that you’ll need a few different
types of treatment over months or years.
Treatments include:





Surgery – The goal of surgery is to
take out the tumor and sometimes the
surrounding tissue. Surgery procedures
range from snipping a single tumor from
the bladder lining to removing the entire
bladder and other organs.

Even though it has a complicated name, the
concept of TURBT is simple. It’s a procedure
that removes tumors through the urethra
without having to cut into the abdomen. The
tumor can then be tested to provide a more
detailed diagnosis.

Intravesical therapy – Intravesical
therapy involves filling the bladder with
a liquid medication that helps destroy
cancer cells.

TURBT is done in an operating room in a
clinic or hospital. You’ll be given anesthesia
to put you to sleep. The urologist then guides
an instrument with a small cutting device
through the urethra and into the bladder. The
instrument is used to examine and remove the
tumor from the bladder lining.

Systemic therapy – Systemic therapy
is typically an intravenous (IV) treatment
that treats cancer anywhere in the whole
body. Types of systemic therapy include
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and
targeted therapy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Clinical trial – Clinical trials are done to
test experimental treatments. You may be
able to join a clinical trial at any time.

Surgery

Treatment for bladder cancer is based on
many things. This includes the extent, severity,
and type of cancer. It also includes your
age, your ability to perform daily tasks, your
other health issues, and the availability and
affordability of drugs. Importantly, treatment is
also based on your wishes and preferences.



Radiation therapy – Radiation therapy
is a local therapy, which means it affects
a specific area of the body. Sometimes
chemotherapy or another therapy is
added to radiation therapy to enhance
treatment.

A treatment called intravesical therapy is often
done in combination with TURBT. (More about

Confirm the initial bladder cancer
diagnosis.

Bladder removal

Take a sample of the bladder wall to see if
the tumor has invaded the muscle layer.

A procedure called a cystectomy treats bladder
cancer by removing the entire bladder. When
the word radical is used, it means taking out
the bladder as well as nearby lymph nodes.
If the disease has spread farther, sometimes
other nearby organs also need to be removed,
including:

Remove all the visible tumor.

After the procedure, most people can go home
the same day. But you’ll need a few days to
rest and recover. You may feel pain or burning
when you urinate and have blood in your urine
for the following 2 weeks or so.
Another TURBT procedure may be needed
about 2 to 6 weeks after the first one. The
second TURBT is done to make sure all the
tumor is removed. Or it may be done to get a
deeper biopsy sample for the pathologist to
examine.

Because a radical cystectomy removes your
entire bladder, you’ll need a new way for urine
to exit your body. So another procedure, called
a urinary diversion, is also done at the same
time.
To find out about the 3 types of urinary
diversion, see the next page.

Radical cystectomy is the most widely used
surgery for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
It’s a major operation that involves cutting
into your abdomen. You’ll need to stay in the
hospital for at least several days. It may take 2
to 3 months or longer for you to recover.

Partial cystectomy
A partial cystectomy is a surgical procedure to
remove part of the bladder. It’s not widely used
for the treatment of bladder cancer. Fewer
than 1 out of 20 people with bladder cancer
are eligible for a partial cystectomy. It can only
be done if the cancer is in a spot that can be
neatly removed without taking out the whole
bladder.

Common side effects and complications of
a radical cystectomy include constipation,
diarrhea, bleeding, bowel problems, infections,
and changes in sexual function. Talk to your

4 Treatment options for bladder cancer » Surgery

Types of urinary diversion
If your bladder is removed, urine needs another way to leave your body. This requires an additional
surgical procedure called a urinary diversion. There are 3 types of urinary diversions:

Ileal conduit

Neobladder

In this urinary diversion, the
surgeon removes a section of the
small intestine (ileum) to use as
a tube (or conduit). The surgeon
also creates a small hole, called
a stoma, in the abdominal wall.
One end of the tube is connected
to the ureters, much like the
bladder was. The other end of
the tube is attached to the stoma.
Urine drains from the kidneys and
ureters, passes through the tube,
and exits the body through the
stoma.

For this procedure, the bladder
is replaced with a segment of
small intestine that acts like a new
bladder (neobladder). Like the
original bladder, this substitute
bladder is attached to the ureters
at one end and to the urethra at
the other end. This means that
urine follows the same path out of
the body it normally would if you
still had your bladder. Because
urine leaves the body in the usual
way, a stoma and an ostomy bag
aren’t needed.

Urine can trickle out of the stoma
at any time. A small disposable
bag is attached to the outside
of your abdomen to collect the
urine when it comes out of the
stoma. This is called an ostomy
bag (or ostomy pouch). The bag
is attached to your body with the
help of an adhesive ring. The ring
sticks to the skin and acts as a
watertight barrier.

A neobladder doesn’t work exactly
the same way as a real bladder.
You’ll probably need to empty it
more often at first, maybe every 1
to 3 hours. Also, urine might come
out when you don’t want or expect
it to, like during sleep. This is
called urinary incontinence. With
time and training, you’ll be able
to better control the flow of urine
from your neobladder. Even so,
a neobladder may be difficult to
empty completely. Some people
have a catheter inserted through
their urethra to help empty the
neobladder.

Most people find that they need to
empty the bag every 2 to 4 hours,
depending on how much liquid
they drink. A closable spout at the
bottom of the bag allows the urine
to be emptied into a toilet without
taking off the bag.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

32

Continent cutaneous
pouch (Indiana pouch)
This urinary diversion uses a
portion of the large intestine to
create a pouch to hold urine. (It’s
also called an Indiana pouch
because it was developed by
surgeons at Indiana University.)
A section of the small intestine is
used to connect the pouch to a
stoma in the wall of the abdomen.
A one-way valve, made from part
of the intestine, prevents the urine
from flowing out of the stoma.
The stoma can be covered by
a small bandage. Sometimes
the stoma can be made in the
belly button, making it much less
noticeable. A catheter must be
inserted into the stoma, through
the valve, and into the pouch
several times a day to drain the
urine.
A benefit to this type of urinary
diversion is that no ostomy bag
is needed. This may appeal to
people with concerns about body
image or people who don’t want to
worry about the bag coming loose
or leaking.

4 Treatment options for bladder cancer » Intravesical therapy

Intravesical therapy

the bladder. Intravesical BCG can lower the
chance of recurrence (cancer coming back) or
getting worse (invading bladder muscle).

While surgery is done to remove visible
cancer, intravesical therapy is used to destroy
cancer cells that aren’t visible or are hard to
reach.

Intravesical BCG is commonly used for highgrade bladder cancer that hasn’t invaded the
muscle layer. It’s usually started about 3 to 6
weeks after TURBT, to allow the bladder time
to heal. It’s given once a week for 6 weeks.
You should have a full re-evaluation at 12
weeks after starting treatment.

Intravesical therapy means putting medicine
directly into the bladder. It’s done with a
flexible tube, called a catheter, inserted into
the urethra. The medicine flows through the
catheter and into the bladder using a process
called instillation.

To prevent recurrence, you might be asked to
continue having intravesical BCG therapy. This
is called maintenance therapy. Maintenance
therapy involves three intravesical BCG
treatments (given in one week) at 3 months
and again at 6 months after TURBT. You may
continue to have maintenance therapy every
6 months for up to 3 years, depending on the
risk of recurrence.

The two main intravesical therapies used to
treat bladder cancer are bacillus CalmetteGuérin (BCG) and chemotherapy.

Intravesical BCG
Intravesical BCG therapy uses a fluid that
contains a very weak bacterium (germ). The
germ triggers the immune system, causing the
immune system to attack cancer cells inside

Possible side effects of intravesical BCG
therapy include fever, chills, the urge to

Intravesical therapy
Intravesical therapy is a
treatment where a liquid
medicine is placed directly

medicine aims to destroy
any cancer cells that TURBT
left behind and to prevent
any new cancer cells from
forming.

urinate, pain or difficulty when urinating, and
blood or particles (clots) in your urine. Talk to
your treatment team about the side effects.
There may be ways to help lessen these
effects.

BCG shortage
Even though BCG has been used for
decades to treat bladder cancer, it’s been
in short supply in the United States and
worldwide for several years. As a result,
many people with non–muscle-invasive
bladder cancer haven’t been able to
receive this treatment or have received a
reduced dose. Patients with the highest
risk are given the first opportunity to
receive it.

If intravesical BCG doesn’t work on its own,
a number of other treatment options are
available in addition to treatment in clinical
trials. Ask your provider or another member of
your care team about these potential options.

Intravesical chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a drug used to kill
actively growing cancer cells. Intravesical
chemotherapy is given to treat the cancer and
to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.

If a regular course of BCG treatment isn’t
available to you, your treatment team
may offer intravesical treatment with
chemotherapy instead.

Intravesical chemotherapy can be given soon
after a TURBT procedure. The treatment is
a one-time dose instilled within 24 hours of
TURBT surgery. It’s meant to “clean up” any
cancer cells that surgery may have left behind
and to prevent any new cancer from growing.

Other options include:

3 Reduced doses or a shorter course
of BCG treatment

3 Eliminating BCG maintenance

Intravesical chemotherapy may also be an
option if BCG is unavailable, or if you were
given BCG therapy but it wasn’t effective. In
these cases, it’s given on the same schedule
as BCG therapy: once a week for 6 weeks,
usually beginning 3 to 4 weeks after TURBT.
Maintenance intravesical chemotherapy, if
given, is usually on a monthly basis for 1 to 2
years.

3 Bladder removal surgery (for those
at high risk of the cancer returning
after treatment)

3 Joining a clinical trial

Because intravesical chemotherapy only
goes into the bladder, not the entire body, it
doesn’t usually cause the harsh side effects
that chemotherapy is known for. However, it
may cause the same type of side effects as
intravesical BCG therapy.

4 Treatment options for bladder cancer » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

What is dose-dense
chemotherapy?

Systemic therapy means a treatment that
affects the whole body. It’s generally given
directly into a vein (intravenously, or IV). The
most common types of systemic therapy
for bladder cancer are chemotherapy and
immunotherapy.

The term dose-dense refers to a
method of speeding up chemotherapy
by shortening the amount of time in
between treatments (doses). The most
common systemic chemotherapy used
to treat bladder cancer is a combination
of medicines known as dose-dense
methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin,
and cisplatin (or ddMVAC).

To determine which type of systemic therapy is
best for you, your treatment team will consider
your overall health. This includes how your
heart, liver, and kidneys are functioning, how
far the cancer has progressed, and your ability
to do day-to-day activities.
Note that systemic chemotherapy is different
than intravesical chemotherapy. Systemic
chemotherapy is a whole-body therapy.
Intravesical chemotherapy only affects the
inside of the bladder.

A commonly used chemotherapy for bladder
cancer is cisplatin, which contains the metal
platinum. Platinum-based chemotherapy
medicines can be effective against bladder
cancer but can also damage the kidneys.
People with kidney conditions or other health
issues may not be able to have chemotherapy
or, if possible, may receive non-platinum
chemotherapy medicine.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is treatment with drugs to
kill cancer cells. Most chemotherapy drugs
are liquids that are slowly injected into a
vein (infusion). The drugs travel in your
bloodstream to treat cancer throughout your
body. Chemotherapy may also harm some
healthy cells, which is why it can cause harsh
side effects. Talk to your care team about any
potential side effects from your chemotherapy
treatment.

Chemotherapy is given in a sequence of
treatments called a cycle. A cycle includes a
period of treatments (such as once-a-day for
a few days) followed by a time of rest (several
days or weeks). This treatment cycle is then
repeated a few times. For example, you might
have 3 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy over 2 to 3
months.

Chemotherapy may be given before surgery
or sometimes after surgery depending on your
type or stage of bladder cancer. Chemotherapy
alone (without surgery) is sometimes the main
treatment for people who have metastatic
bladder cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a type of systemic therapy
that uses your immune system (your body’s
natural defense against infection and disease)
to find and destroy cancer cells.

4 Treatment options for bladder cancer » Radiation therapy

Checkpoint inhibitors are one type of
immunotherapy used to treat bladder cancer
and other cancers. Checkpoint inhibitors block
the natural braking mechanisms in the body
to allow your immune system to better identify
and fight the cancer. The checkpoint inhibitors
for bladder cancer include:


Keytruda (pembrolizumab)



Opdivo (nivolumab)



Bavencio (avelumab)



Tecentriq (atezolizumab)

Because targeted therapy doesn’t harm normal
cells as much as chemotherapy, the side
effects tend to be different.
Notably, the preferred therapy for metastatic
bladder cancer is a combination of a targeted
therapy (Padcev) and an immunotherapy
(Keytruda).

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses high-energy waves—
such as x-rays—to kill cancer cells and shrink
tumors. The type of radiation therapy usually
used for bladder cancer is called external
beam radiation therapy (EBRT). In EBRT, a
large machine aims radiation at the tumor
area.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy is a systemic treatment that
can pick out and attack certain types of cancer
cells. Targeted therapy is more often used for
people with specific gene mutations. If you
don’t have the mutation that the medicine
“targets,” this treatment is unlikely to help.

Radiation therapy can be given alone but is
more often given with other bladder cancer
treatments:

Targeted therapies for certain types of bladder
cancer include:






Chemoradiation

Padcev (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv), also
known as an antibody-drug conjugate,
targets and attaches itself to a specific
protein, Nectin-4, found on the surface of
bladder cancer cells.

Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are
often used together to treat bladder cancer.
When given together, they work better than
they do alone. This is called chemoradiation
or chemoradiotherapy. Like many cancer
treatments, chemoradiation works better for
certain people than for others.

Balversa (erdafitinib) is a targeted therapy
used for people whose bladder cancer is
due to specific mutations in the FGFR3
gene.

Trimodal therapy

Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy)
seeks and latches onto the protein Trop-2,
found in large numbers on cancer cells.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Trimodal therapy refers to a combination
of three treatments: TURBT to remove
all visible cancer, followed by radiation
and chemotherapy given together
(chemoradiation).

4 Treatment options for bladder cancer » Clinical trials

In certain people with bladder cancer, trimodal
therapy can be used instead of bladder
removal surgery (radical cystectomy). This
is why trimodal therapy is referred to as a
"bladder preserving" treatment.





Clinical trials

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in certain ways
in order to compare how they respond to a
specific treatment.

After being developed and tested in a
laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If a new
drug, device, or treatment approach is found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, it may
be approved by the FDA.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and benefits
of joining.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of their treatment options, including
standard treatments and clinical trials. Talk
with your care team about whether a clinical
trial may make sense for you.

All of this information is also provided in
an informed consent form. This agreement
confirms that you’ve been fully told about your
part in the trial. Read the form carefully and
ask questions before signing it. Take time
to discuss it with family, friends, or others
you trust. Keep in mind that clinical trials are
voluntary and you can seek treatment outside
of the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.



Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Who can enroll?

Therapy may also be given as part of a
clinical trial. A clinical trial is a type of medical
research study and a vital way to assess new
treatment methods.



Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.

Frequently asked questions

Worldwide

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

The U.S. National Library of Medicine
(NLM)

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It’s common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You’ll be informed if a
placebo is part of a clinical trial before you
enroll.

Are clinical trials free?
There’s no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor usually pays for researchrelated costs, including the study drug. You
may, however, have costs indirectly related to
the trial, such as the cost of transportation or
childcare due to extra appointments.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Depending on the trial, you may continue to
receive standard cancer care. The standard
treatment is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You’re responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that aren’t covered by
your insurance.

4 Treatment options for bladder cancer » Supportive care

Supportive care

Intravesical therapy – swelling
(inflammation) of the bladder lining, frequent
urination, pain or burning feeling when
urinating, blood in the urine, infection

Supportive care is health care that relieves
symptoms caused by cancer or by its
treatment. The aim of supportive care is to
improve your quality of life. Supportive care
may include relieving symptoms, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling.

Chemotherapy – nausea, vomiting, extreme
tiredness (fatigue), fever, infection, tingling or
numbness, rash, diarrhea
Immunotherapy – autoimmune reaction,
fatigue, fever, nausea, loss of appetite,
infection, diarrhea, constipation

Supportive care is available at any cancer
stage. Speak to your care team about how
you’re feeling and if you’re having any side
effects. You can read more about supportive
care in Chapter 8.

Not every patient develops nausea or vomiting
from cancer therapy. But if you have these side
effects, it’s important to reduce them as much
as possible to prevent them from interfering
with your treatment.

Side effects of treatment

Read more about these side effects in NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Nausea and Vomiting,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

A side eﬀect is an unhealthy or unpleasant
physical or emotional condition caused by
treatment. All treatments for bladder cancer
can cause side eﬀects.
Some people have many side eﬀects while
others have few. Some side eﬀects can
be very serious while others are simply
unpleasant. Most side eﬀects appear soon
after treatment starts and go away after
treatment ends. Other side eﬀects are longterm or may appear years later.
Side effects depend on many factors,
especially the type of treatment (radiation
versus chemotherapy, for example) and the
length or the dose of treatment. Here are some
common side effects of different treatments:
Bladder removal surgery – bleeding,
blood clots, kidney problems, infection, sexual
dysfunction, incontinence, problems caused by
the urinary diversion

Other notable side effects
Some side effects happen more commonly in
people with bladder cancer, particularly after
bladder cancer surgery. While you may not
get these side effects, you should be aware of
them as you consider the benefits and risks of
different treatments:








Sexual dysfunction – Treatment or
cancer itself may interfere with your
ability to have sex. Sexual dysfunction
also includes a decreased desire to have
sex. This may be due to a lack of energy,
being self-conscious about your body
after surgery, or feeling stressed out and
depressed.





Trouble controlling the flow of
urine – Urine may come out when you’re
not expecting it. This is referred to as
urinary incontinence. But there are things
you can do, like pelvic floor exercises,
that can help you regain control of urine
function.



Many side effects can be managed. Some can
even be prevented. Ask your treatment team
for a complete list of short- and long-term side
effects and information on how to manage
them.

Treatment options for bladder cancer
depend on the stage and grade of your
cancer, your overall health, and your
preferences.
Transurethral resection of bladder tumor
(TURBT) is a procedure that examines
tumors on the bladder wall and removes
them.
Radical cystectomy is the most widely
used surgery for muscle-invasive bladder
cancer. It involves removing the bladder,
nearby lymph nodes, and other organs in
the pelvis.
A urinary diversion is a surgical procedure
included with a radical cystectomy. Its
purpose is to provide a new way for urine
to leave the body.
Intravesical therapy is the use of cancer
medicine placed directly into the bladder
through a catheter. The medicine is slowly
put into the bladder using a process
called instillation.
Chemotherapy is treatment with drugs
to kill cancer cells. Most chemotherapy
drugs are liquids that are slowly injected
into a vein (infusion). Chemotherapy
affects cancer cells (and other cells)
throughout the whole body.
All treatments for bladder cancer can
cause side eﬀects. Ask your care team
about ways to deal with the side effects of
treatment.

Stage 0 and stage 1
bladder cancers

Treatment for non–muscleinvasive bladder cancer aims
to reduce the chance of cancer

Stage 0 bladder cancer occurs only on the
surface of the urothelial layer (inner lining) of
the bladder. There are two types of stage 0
bladder cancer:

and to prevent the cancer from
progressing to a more advanced



stage.

Bladder cancer that hasn’t grown into the
muscle layer of the bladder wall is called non–
muscle-invasive. Stage 0 and stage 1 bladder
cancers are non–muscle-invasive. Often, non–
muscle-invasive bladder cancer can be treated
without removing the bladder.



Stage 0is (also called carcinoma in situ,
or CIS) is a flat tumor on the inner lining
of the bladder.

Stage 1 bladder cancer has grown into the
layer of connective tissue of the bladder wall
but hasn’t reached the muscle layer.

Stage 0 and stage 1
bladder cancers
Stage 0 bladder cancer
occurs only on the inner
lining (urothelial layer) of
the bladder wall.
Stage 1 bladder cancer
has grown through the
inner lining and into
the layer of connective
tissue, but it hasn’t
reached the muscle layer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

Stage 0a (also called noninvasive
papillary carcinoma) are finger-like
projections that grow from the inner
surface toward the hollow center of the
bladder.

43

5 Treatment for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer » Stage 0 and stage 1 bladder cancers

Treatment for stage 0 and stage 1 bladder
cancers depends on whether the cancer
has low, medium, or high risk for coming
back (recurrence) or continuing to grow
(progression). The level of risk is based on
certain features, including the stage, whether
it’s growing slow or fast (low or high grade),
its size, and whether there’s more than one
tumor. See Guide 2.

Your biopsy sample and your first TURBT test
typically reveal this risk. A second (repeat)
TURBT may be needed if the first TURBT
didn’t remove enough of the tumor or didn’t
include any muscle tissue from the bladder
wall. If the repeat TURBT finds that the cancer
has invaded the muscle layer, the tumor will
be treated as muscle-invasive bladder cancer
(stage 2 or higher).

For example, a small, slow-growing stage
0a tumor has a low risk of recurrence or
progression. On the other hand, cancer with
multiple large fast-growing stage 0a tumors
has a high risk.

Also, you may have received a single dose
of intravesical chemotherapy when you had
your first TURBT. This can help prevent
cancer recurrence. This “one-shot” intravesical
treatment is separate from the 6-week course
of intravesical therapy recommended in

Guide 2.

You’ve had a lot of tests. Now your care team





High risk bladder cancer with
very high-risk features has a greater
chance of progressing to an advanced
stage, so radical cystectomy is the
preferred treatment. However, intravesical
BCG may be an option in certain cases.

Very high-risk features include:

Low risk bladder cancer care is
surveillance. Surveillance means
watching out for cancer to reappear after
it’s been treated. For stage 0 bladder
cancer, surveillance usually involves
follow-up cystoscopy and urine cytology
tests every 3 to 6 months for 2 years or
more.

•

Medium risk bladder cancer has
a fair chance of recurring. Although
surveillance is a reasonable option,
the preferred treatment is a 6-week
course of intravesical therapy (BCG or
chemotherapy).

•

•

•

Intravesical BCG therapy has no effect
on it.
Tumor cells are found in the blood or in
lymph vessels outside of the main tumor
(lymphovascular invasion).
Cancer recurrence develops in the
urethra.
The cancer is a rare subtype that
usually leads to poor outcomes.

Supportive care should also be available
during treatment. Supportive care is for
relieving symptoms and for other concerns.

High risk bladder cancer has a major
risk of coming back or growing further.
High risk cancer is typically treated with
intravesical BCG therapy (if you haven’t
had BCG before), although radical
cystectomy is also an option.

If you have high-risk non–muscle-invasive
bladder cancer but you can’t have BCG or
if it doesn’t work for you, then the preferred
treatment is a radical cystectomy. If you
can’t have or don’t want a cystectomy, then
intravesical chemotherapy is an option.
If neither BCG nor cystectomy is a good
option, then Keytruda (pembrolizumab),
Adstiladrin (nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg),
or Anktiva (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln)
may be possible options in certain specific
cases.

Follow-up care is all about watching for the
recurrence of cancer. When cancer does
return, it’s helpful to know how to deal with it.





If cancer returns during follow-up therapy,
it’s usually detected by a cystoscopy exam.
However, sometimes a urine cytology test
indicates signs of cancer when cystoscopy
doesn’t. Here’s what will happen depending on
the results of these tests:



Urine cytology of the upper urinary tract
Ureteroscopy, a test that examines the
insides of the kidneys and ureters

If the biopsy of the bladder or urinary tract
finds cancer, you’ll have another TURBT to
find out your current level of risk.
See Guide 2.

If cystoscopy finds cancer

Treatment for other test results:

If cancer appears on a follow-up cystoscopy
test, you’ll have another TURBT to re-assess
the cancer risk. The level of risk indicates the
appropriate treatment. See Guide 2.





For example, if the repeat TURBT shows
that the cancer has come back as high risk
non–muscle-invasive cancer, the preferred
treatment is intravesical BCG therapy. Radical
cystectomy is also an option, especially if
you’ve had BCG therapy before and it didn’t
reduce the cancer. After this treatment, you’ll
resume follow-up.



If none of the tests detect cancer, you
should have a follow-up visit in 3 months
for more tests.
If a biopsy finds cancer in the prostate,
then further testing and treatment of the
prostate is needed.
If a urine cytology of the upper tract
indicates cancer, then you’ll need further
testing and treatment of the upper urinary
tract.

After treatment, your follow-up schedule will
depend on the current stage of your cancer
and what treatment you’ve already received.

If urine cytology indicates cancer
If the results from a follow-up urine cytology
test suggest cancer may have returned—and
a second cytology test confirms the first one—
then more testing is needed to pinpoint where
the cancer is.
Further testing will look for cancer in the
bladder as well as other areas such as the
prostate and upper urinary tract.

Treatment for non–muscle-invasive
bladder cancer is based on the risk that
the cancer will come back or continue to
grow.
Surveillance is often the best care for low
risk bladder cancer. Surveillance means
occasional testing to find out if cancer has
returned.
The preferred treatment for medium risk
bladder cancer is intravesical therapy with
either BCG or chemotherapy.
High risk cancer is typically treated with
intravesical BCG therapy, although radical
cystectomy is also an option.
Radical cystectomy is the preferred
treatment for high risk bladder cancer with
very high-risk features.
Follow-up testing is based on the risk of
the cancer returning. The higher the risk,

chemotherapy drugs, one of which is
cisplatin. Cisplatin has been shown to
be the most effective chemotherapy for
treating bladder cancer. Typically, 3 to 6
cycles of chemotherapy are given before
bladder removal surgery. For recommended
chemotherapy options, see Guide 5.

Can you tolerate chemotherapy with the
drug cisplatin?
Are you healthy enough to undergo a
major surgery to remove your bladder?

To help answer these questions, you’ll receive
further evaluation, such as CT or MRI imaging
of the abdomen and pelvis. Another essential
test checks the health of your kidneys. This is
a simple blood test to make sure your kidneys
are working well enough to handle the stress
of chemotherapy.

About 1 to 2 months after finishing
chemotherapy, you’ll have surgery to remove
the bladder (radical cystectomy). A radical
cystectomy is often the best option to treat
muscle-invasive bladder cancer and help
prevent it from returning. During the radical
cystectomy procedure, the surgeon will also
create a urinary diversion.

Some people with stage 2 bladder cancer can’t
have surgery or don’t want it. If this describes
you, you can skip the next section and go
directly to Treatment without bladder removal

Radiation therapy (in selected patients
whose tumor was larger and/or cancer

There are three treatment options that don’t
involve removing the bladder:
Trimodal therapy
Trimodal therapy is a bladder preserving
treatment for certain people with muscleinvasive bladder cancer. In trimodal therapy,
TURBT (transurethral resection of bladder
tumor) first removes any visible tumor and then
chemotherapy and radiation are used together
to kill any cancer cells left over. Trimodal
therapy may be a good option if Guide 7
describes your cancer.

Follow-up
For recommendations on follow-up care and
monitoring for the return of cancer, see
page 61.

Treatment without bladder
removal
Not everyone may need, want, or be able
to have a radical cystectomy. If you have
other serious health problems or you’re
physically unable to do many day-to-day
activities, surgery may not be a good option
for you. Or, your tumor may be small enough
to be removed without removing the whole
bladder. Bladder cancer treatment that doesn’t

Radiation therapy alone
If you’re not able to have chemoradiation and
you’re not able or don’t want to have radical
cystectomy, radiation therapy alone is a
possible treatment option for people with stage
2 or stage 3A bladder cancer.

Guide 7
Can you have bladder preserving treatment?
Chemoradiation without bladder removal surgery is an option only for some
people with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Every person is different, but here are some common characteristics of those who
can have bladder-preserving treatment:
• The tumor is smaller than 6 centimeters (about as long as a house key
or an egg).
Common
characteristics

• The tumor is not blocking the flow of urine from the kidneys into the
bladder.
• No carcinoma in situ (CIS). CIS is an area of flat, fast-growing cancer
cells on the inside lining of the bladder.
• The tumor can be entirely removed by TURBT.

“

TURBT
Having only a TURBT procedure may be an
option for people who can’t have, or don’t
want, radical cystectomy. This option may work
better if the tumor is smaller than 2 centimeters
(about the size of a penny or a grape). Within 4
weeks of the TURBT, you should have a repeat
TURBT to make sure there’s no cancer left
behind.

Come armed to each and every
appointment with all of your
questions and concerns—and do
not leave until you get them all

What’s next?
The tumor should be checked 2 to 3 months
after you’ve finished treatment. Depending on
whether cancer is still found, this is generally
what might happen next:
If no cancer is found, you can begin followup care and monitoring for the return of cancer.
If cancer is still there and you can have
radical cystectomy, treatment options are
based on the type and size of the remaining
tumor. Options include TURBT with or without
intravesical therapy if the tumor is now stage
1, radical cystectomy if the tumor is stage 2, or
treatment for metastatic cancer.

Surveillance is a key part of your follow-up
plan. Be sure to go to follow-up visits and
stay in touch with your treatment team.

If cancer is still there but you can’t
have or don’t want radical cystectomy,
treatment options include cisplatin-based
chemotherapy, TURBT with or without
intravesical therapy, and supportive care. For
stage 2 bladder cancer, radiation therapy alone
is also an option if you didn’t have it previously.

Stage 3B bladder cancer

Systemic therapy
Systemic therapy affects the whole body, not
just part of it. The goal of systemic therapy is
to shrink the tumor as much as possible and,
most importantly, kill any cancer cells outside
of the bladder.

Stage 3B bladder cancer is considered locally
advanced. This means the cancer has grown
outside the bladder and spread to multiple
lymph nodes in the pelvis or to at least one
lymph node in the upper pelvic region. But
the cancer has not spread to organs or lymph
nodes far from the bladder.

The most common systemic therapies
for locally advanced bladder cancer are
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and
immunotherapy. The recommended treatment
options are listed in Guide 8.

The main treatment options for stage 3B
bladder cancer are systemic therapy or
chemoradiation. Additional treatment may
be needed depending on how well the main
therapy works.

The standard treatment for locally advanced
bladder cancer has long been platinum-based
chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin).
More recently, cancer experts have begun
treating locally advanced and metastatic
bladder cancer with a combination of a

from the bladder.

After either type of treatment, you’ll need a few
tests to see if the therapy worked. Testing is
recommended after 2 to 3 cycles of systemic
therapy, or 2 to 3 months after finishing
chemoradiation. Tests include cystoscopy,
TURBT, and examination and/or imaging of
your abdomen and pelvis.

Treatment options for stage 4A bladder
cancer depend on whether the cancer has or

When you’ve finished initial treatment, the
next phase of cancer care will begin. This is
the follow-up (or surveillance) phase. During
this time, you’ll have occasional tests to watch
out for your cancer to return. As mentioned
elsewhere in this book, bladder cancer can
come back at any time. So be sure you
don’t skip or forget to go to any follow-up
appointments.

Follow-up
For recommendations on follow-up care and
monitoring for cancer recurrence, see Followup care, on the right.

Stage 4A metastatic
Stage 4A cancer has spread to distant lymph
nodes in the body (metastasized). The main
treatment is systemic therapy, which is
treatment that affects cancer cells throughout
the body. For recommended systemic therapy
options, see Guide 8.

If you have any symptoms or problems, don’t
wait until your next follow-up visit. Call your
doctor or care team right away.
The specific tests you should have—and how
often you should have them—depend on
whether your bladder was removed.

After treatment, you’ll have a few tests to
see if the therapy worked. Tests may include
cystoscopy, TURBT, and imaging of your
abdomen and pelvis. If the tests show that the
cancer didn’t grow or spread after systemic
therapy, you may have maintenance treatment
to retain the benefits of therapy and to slow the
cancer from growing. Bavencio (avelumab),
a checkpoint inhibitor, is the preferred
maintenance option.

If your bladder was removed
Even if you had surgery to remove your
bladder, cancer can still come back in other
areas, such as the upper urinary tract, the
urethra, or elsewhere in your body. So you can
expect to have follow-up tests and visits for
many years.

If no cancer is found or if there’s less
cancer after initial therapy, then your doctor
may ask you to consider local therapy with
surgery or radiation to get rid of any cancer
in the bladder that may be left behind. This
treatment is mostly for people who want to
be very aggressive with therapy and who had
good results with systemic therapy.

If a bladder tumor grows into the thick
layer of muscle in the bladder wall, it’s
called muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Stage 2, 3, and 4 bladder cancers are
muscle-invasive.
Radical cystectomy is the main treatment
for people with stage 2 or 3A bladder
cancer who are healthy enough for
surgery. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy
is often given beforehand to shrink the
tumor prior to the surgery.
Some people with stage 2 or 3A muscleinvasive bladder cancer can’t have or
don’t want a radical cystectomy. For these
people, treatment options include TURBT
and chemoradiation, radiation therapy
alone, or TURBT alone.
The main treatment options for stage 3B
and 4A bladder cancers are systemic
therapy or chemoradiation.
Follow-up testing after treatment for
muscle-invasive bladder cancer includes
imaging, urine and blood tests, and tests
to check your liver and kidney health.

or metastatic cancer. Treatment
of metastatic bladder cancer is
focused on helping you live as
normally and as comfortably as
possible, for as long as possible.

Being diagnosed with metastatic bladder
cancer is very difficult. It can cause a lot
of anxiety and stress. Talking about it with
doctors, nurses, therapists, or counselors, as
well as other people with bladder cancer, can
be helpful. Ask your treatment team about
these and other resources.

Stage 4B is metastatic bladder cancer. This
cancer has grown through the bladder wall and
has spread (metastasized) to lymph nodes or
organs far from the bladder. Metastatic bladder
cancer may have spread to areas like the
bones, liver, or lungs.

These are called “first-line” therapies because
they have the best chance of working, so they
should be used first.

The main treatment for metastatic bladder
cancer is usually systemic therapy. Systemic
therapies—like chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
and targeted therapy—affect the whole body.
To determine which systemic therapy medicine
is best for you, your care team will consider
your overall health. This includes how your
heart, liver, and kidneys are functioning, how
far the cancer has progressed, and your ability
to do day-to-day activities.

The standard first-line treatment for metastatic
bladder cancer has long been platinum-based
chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin). But
cancer experts are now treating metastatic
bladder cancer with a combination of a
targeted chemotherapy (Padcev) and an
immunotherapy (Keytruda). This combination
appears to be more effective than platinumbased chemotherapy for metastatic bladder
cancer.

Tests may include:

If you’re not able to have this combination
treatment or if it’s unavailable, platinum-based
chemotherapy and other immunotherapy
and targeted therapy medicines are still
recommended for treating metastatic bladder
cancer.

Bone scan or MRI to look for any cancer
in your bones
CT of your chest to look for cancer in your
lungs and other organs

Maintenance therapy

CT or MRI imaging of your brain and
spinal cord

If you had platinum-based chemotherapy as
your first-line therapy, and your cancer didn’t
grow or spread as a result, then you may have
maintenance treatment to retain the benefits of
therapy and to slow the cancer from growing.
Bavencio (avelumab), a checkpoint inhibitor, is
the preferred maintenance option.

Blood test to see if your kidneys can
process chemotherapy drugs
Biopsy of any suspicious areas
Molecular or genomic testing to find
biomarkers that show you can have
certain targeted therapies.

Maintenance therapy may not be required after
other types of first-line systemic therapy.

Follow-up
After you’ve been on therapy for a while, your
treatment team will want to see how well the
therapy is working. Follow-up tests are listed in

Guide 13.

If you had chemotherapy as your first-line
treatment, then the preferred next treatment
option is immunotherapy with Keytruda. Other
preferred next treatment options include
Opdivo (nivolumab), Bavencio, Padcev, or
Balversa (if genetic testing shows you have a
change in the FGFR3 gene.)

If the cancer stays the same or improves,
treatment is usually continued.
If the cancer continues to grow or if the
treatment is too harsh, a different treatment
should be considered.

What’s next?

Key points

After you’ve been treated for metastatic
bladder cancer, you’ll continue to have tests
and visits to watch out for cancer to return
or progress, or to treat your existing cancer.
Surveillance is a key part of your follow-up
plan. So be sure to continue to go to followup visits and stay in touch with your treatment
team. As always, you can ask to join a clinical
trial.







Know that you can have bladder cancer and
still enjoy life after diagnosis and treatment.
Try to enjoy life as much as possible. Join a
support group if you need additional resources.



Some people may reach a point where
treatment stops working and there are no other
treatments available. Even people who are
still receiving treatment may feel at times like
there’s no hope. It’s common to feel frustration,
anger, regret, despair, and uncertainty—
even all at the same time. Talk with family
or friends. Or talk to your doctor or another
member of your care team. They can point you
to professionals who can help you deal with
these feelings and guide you toward your next
steps.

Treatment of metastatic bladder cancer is
focused on helping you live as normally
and as comfortably as possible, for as
long as possible.
Talking about your diagnosis with doctors,
nurses, therapists, or counselors, as well
as other people with bladder cancer, can
be helpful.
You should expect further testing to find
out how many metastases there are and
where they are in the body.
The main treatment for metastatic bladder
cancer is systemic therapy. Systemic
therapies include chemotherapy,
immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors),
and targeted therapy.
Joining a clinical trial is strongly
recommended for people with metastatic

psychological, social, financial,
and spiritual issues. Many
resources are available to help
you feel better and to answer your
questions.

The main concern for most patients with
cancer is to find treatment that works. Having
cancer is about more than treatment, though.
Cancer care is a rollercoaster that includes
many additional physical and emotional
challenges. It’s important to know that you can
get support for these challenges.

More information about cancer and
distress is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Supportive care
Supportive care is for relieving the symptoms
of cancer and the side effects of cancer
therapies, and other health issues related
to the cancer. Supportive care—also
called palliative care—can also help with
psychological, social, and spiritual issues.
Supportive care involves the whole person, not
just their cancer.

Notably, supportive care can help prevent
or treat physical and emotional symptoms.
Supportive care can also help with financial
support, advance care planning, and end-oflife concerns.

Supportive care can be given at any stage of
disease, not just at the end of life.

It’s important to talk openly with your treatment
team about supportive care. Ask questions and
reach out if you need more information about
your next steps.

Supportive care addresses many needs. It can
help with making treatment decisions. It can
also assist with coordinating care between
health providers.

available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Exercise can make you feel
better. Plus, research has shown
that exercise helps some people
with bladder cancer live longer.

Financial concerns
The financial cost of bladder cancer can be
overwhelming. Bladder cancer has the highest
cost over a patient’s lifetime of any cancer.
As a result, many people with bladder cancer
and their loved ones struggle with the cost of
treatment, as well as the stress of paying for it.

Anxiety and depression
Many people with cancer experience
symptoms of distress, such as anxiety and
depression. You may feel anxious during
testing, or you may experience depression
during a hard part of treatment. Tell your
treatment team so that you can get help.

To make things worse, you may miss work
during treatment or become unemployed. Or
you may have trouble paying for or getting
medicines. Or you may have too little or no
health insurance.

Help can include support groups, talk therapy,
or medication. At your cancer center, cancer
navigators, social workers, and other experts
can help. Some people also feel better by
exercising, talking with friends or loved ones,
or relaxing.

If you struggle to pay for food, housing,
treatment, follow-up care, and other expenses,
or you have difficulty getting to appointments,
talk with your care team’s social worker,
patient navigators, and hospital financial
services. They may be able to help you find
financial support and transportation options.

Support groups
Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, have a look at the online resources
listed on page 90 of this book.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

You can also talk to your treatment team about
work, insurance, or money problems. They’ll
include information in the treatment plan to
help you manage your finances and medical
costs. If your doctors and care providers don’t
talk about how to pay for treatment, it’s okay
for you to ask them about it first.

Advance care planning

the best possible care at the end of your life.
Patients with incurable cancer can set up
an advance care plan early on to feel less
stressed and better able to cope with their
condition.

When cancer is diagnosed very late or keeps
progressing despite all treatment efforts, it
may be time to consider what lies ahead. This
exploration of what’s important to you is called
advance care planning.

The advance care planning process starts
with an open and honest discussion with your
care team about your prognosis—what you
may experience in the coming months—and
the medications or therapies that may give
you the best quality of life. Quality of life
refers to a person’s overall enjoyment of life,
including their sense of well-being and ability
to participate in their usual activities.

Advance care planning is for everyone,
not just for those who are very sick. Even
when cancers are curable, talking about
future scenarios should begin when starting
treatment.
Advance care planning means deciding what
care you would want if you become unable to
make medical decisions for yourself. It’s about
making sure that your wishes are understood
and respected. The focus is on you receiving

This discussion should include your spouse
or partner and other family members who love
you and are likely to be with you at the end.

Make your wishes clear. It’s important that
everyone clearly understands the goals of your
care and your personal wishes about what
should—and should not—be done.

Note that hospice is a special kind of endof-life care. Hospice refers specifically to
an insurance benefit for people whose life
expectancy is 6 months or less. Hospice
supports those at the end of life by bringing in
additional care providers and resources such
as home care.

You can decide if there is a point where you
might want to stop cancer treatment. You can
also decide what treatments you would want
for symptom relief.

The goal of end-of-life care is to give people the
best life possible with the time they have left.
Care can be provided in your home, a hospice
facility, or even in the hospital. A major goal is to
keep you pain-free and make sure that you can
leave this world comfortably and with dignity.
Hospice doctors, nurses, social workers, and
chaplains are experts in helping patients work
through the spiritual and emotional challenges
of coping with the end of life.

Once you’ve made these decisions, you’ll fill out
a legal document that explains what you want to
be done if you aren’t able to tell your care team
yourself. This document is called an advance
directive. Doctors are required to follow the
instructions in an advance directive when you’re
too ill to make decisions about your care.
Tell your care team and family about your
advance directive and its contents. Give a
copy of your advance directive to all your
doctors. Make sure you give a copy to anyone
you’ve authorized to make decisions on your
behalf (health care proxy). If your family or
loved ones disagree with your plan, speak
to your care team. Sometimes they or other
specialists can help you and your family
navigate these difficult conversations.

“Find a support network that understands
your cancer type and the journey you are
taking. Learning from others and having
a safe place to ask questions is a huge
benefit.”

You can change your advance care plan at any
time. Frequent conversations with your care
team can help.

End-of-life considerations
End-of-life care provides medical,
psychological, and spiritual support for people
who are close to the end of life as well as the
people who love them. The goal is comfort, not
a cure. It may also be called comfort care or
hospice.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Bladder Cancer, 2024

“

Providing support for family members is a
key part of hospice care. Most programs offer
counseling and support groups for family
members, including support after the patient
has died. This is referred to as bereavement.
It can be very comforting to know that your
loved ones will have that kind of support after
you’re gone.

Be your own advocate. Ask a lot
of questions, even the ones you
are afraid to ask. Don’t be afraid to
ask for a second opinion. You have
to protect yourself and ensure
you make the best decisions for
you, and get the best care for your
particular situation.”

choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest
conversation with your care team.

Second opinion
It’s normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer treatment shouldn’t
be ignored, there is usually time to have
another cancer care provider review your test
results and suggest a treatment plan. This
is called getting a second opinion, and it’s a

second opinions!

A treatment given after the initial therapy kills
all visible cancer. Consolidation therapy is
used to treat any cancer cells left behind by
previous therapy.

biomarker
Something found in your body that can be
measured to assess your health. Usually
identified by a blood test or a test of tumor
tissue.

continent urinary reservoir
A type of urinary diversion in which a portion of
the large intestine is used as a pouch to hold
urine. A section of the small intestine connects
the pouch to a hole (stoma) in the wall of the
abdomen. A catheter is used to drain urine
from the reservoir. Also called an Indiana
pouch.

biopsy
A procedure that removes fluid or tissue
samples to be tested for disease.
bone scan
An imaging test used to view bones for cancer
or other problems.

cystectomy
A surgical procedure that removes all or part of
the bladder.

cancer grade
A rating of the difference between cancer cells
and normal cells under the microscope. It’s
used to predict how fast the cancer is likely to
grow or spread.

cystoscopy
A procedure that allows a doctor to see inside
the bladder using a special tool inserted
through the urethra. Usually occurs in a
procedure room in the doctor’s office.

carcinoma in situ (CIS)
A flat area of cancer cells that hasn’t grown
any farther than where it started.

dose-dense chemotherapy
A method of speeding up chemotherapy
by reducing the amount of time between
treatments.

chemoradiation
Cancer treatment with both chemotherapy and
radiation therapy.

external beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
A cancer treatment in which a machine outside
the body sends radiation to cancer cells inside
the body.

chemotherapy
Cancer drugs that stop the cell life cycle
to kill the cancer cells. Chemotherapy for
bladder cancer can be given as systemic or
intravesical therapy.

first-line therapy
The first type of treatment given for a condition
or disease. First-line therapy is the one
considered to be the best treatment.

computed tomography (CT)
An imaging test that uses x-rays from many
angles to make a picture of the inside of the
body.

hematuria
The presence of blood in urine.

92

Words to know

small intestine (ileum) is used as a pipeline
(conduit) for urine to leave the body through a
hole (stoma) in the abdomen.

non–muscle-invasive
Bladder cancer that hasn’t grown into the
muscle layer of the bladder wall.
positron emission tomography (PET)
A test that uses radioactive material to see the
shape and function of body parts.

immunotherapy
A drug treatment that helps the body’s immune
system find and destroy cancer cells.

radiation therapy
A treatment that uses high-energy rays
(radiation) to destroy cancer cells.

intravesical therapy
A treatment that uses a catheter to put
medicine directly into the bladder.

radical cystectomy
A surgical procedure that removes the bladder,
nearby lymph nodes, and other organs in the
pelvis.

local therapy
A treatment given to a specific area or organ of
the body. Examples are surgery and radiation.

recurrence
The return of cancer after a cancer-free period.

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

and powerful magnets to make pictures of the
insides of the body.

resection
A surgical procedure that removes as much
cancer as possible while leaving the rest of the
tissue or organ in place.

maintenance therapy
Therapy meant to prolong positive results after
a good response to treatment, usually given
before progression may occur.

stage
A rating of the extent of cancer in the body.
supportive care
Health care that relieves symptoms caused by
cancer or by its treatment.

metastasis
The spread of cancer from the place where it
started to another part of the body.

surveillance
Ongoing testing after treatment ends to watch
for cancer to return.

muscle-invasive
Bladder cancer that has invaded the muscle
layer of the bladder wall.

systemic therapy
A type of treatment that works throughout the
body.

mutation
An abnormal change in the genetic instructions
for making and controlling cells.

targeted therapy
A cancer treatment that can target and attack
specific types of cancer cells.

neobladder
A type of urinary diversion in which a piece
of small intestine is made into a new urinary
reservoir. This is connected directly to the
urethra so you can pee more normally.
