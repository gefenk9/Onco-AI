About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Version 1.2024 —
December 21, 2023.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are

MPNs are not…

a type of blood cancer. Also called
MPNs, these cancers grow slowly,

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)

Like MPNs, MDS are cancers of blood stem
cells within the myeloid cell line. MDS cause
low numbers of blood cells.

so many people with MPNs have
long lives. The impact of MPNs
on quality of life greatly varies

Myelodysplastic syndromes/
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/
MPN)

between people. For some, MPNs
cause life-changing symptoms.

MDS/MPN is a group of cancers distinct from
MPN and MDS. The mature blood cells are
abnormal, and there are high numbers of blood
cells.

What are MPNs?

Systemic mastocytosis

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a
group of rare blood cancers with an unusual
name. What exactly does the name mean?






Systemic mastocytosis is a buildup of a type of
white blood cells, called mast cells, in the body,
excluding the skin. A subtype called systemic
mastocytosis with an associated hematologic
neoplasm (SM-AHN) can occur with MPN.

The first part of the first word—myelo —
refers to bone marrow. Almost all bones
have a soft center, called marrow, where
most blood cells are formed.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

AML is a cancer of myeloid cells in bone
marrow. It causes many abnormal myeloid
blasts, which cannot become mature blood
cells. An MPN may transform into AML although
it rarely does.

The second part of the first word—
proliferative —refers to the rapid growth
of cells.
A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of
cells.

Put together, the name myeloproliferative
neoplasms means cancers of blood cells in
the bone marrow. There are many types of
blood cells, so there are many types of blood
cancers. Let’s review in the next section how
blood cells are made to further understand
what MPNs are.

1 MPN basics » What are MPNs?

MPNs affect very young blood cells

make different cells that are a step closer to
being blood cells. These different cells are
called progenitor cells.

Blood cells do not live long, so they need to be
replaced often. They arise from changes in a
series of cells. The process can be simplified
into 3 steps:

2. Progenitor cells belong to one of two
families of blood cells—myeloid or
lymphoid cell lines. Progenitor cells change
into blast cells. Blasts, for short, are young
(or immature) blood cells.

1. Hematopoietic stem cells develop into
every type of blood cell, including red blood
cells, white bloods cells, and platelets.
They make exact copies of themselves and

Blood cells
Blood stem cells are the cells from which all blood cells are formed. They go through a series
of changes to become mature blood cells. The three main types of blood cells are red blood
cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes), and
platelets (thrombocytes).

What are the classic
MPNs?

3. Each type of blast is set to become a
certain type of mature blood cell. Mature
blood cells are fully developed cells that
perform specific functions. The main types
of blood cells are red blood cells, white
blood cells, and platelets.

There are several types of MPNs, but this book
is about the most common (or classic) types:


MPNs affect cells in the first step of blood cell
formation. They are cancers of blood stem
cells but only affect the myeloid family of cells.
Myeloid blasts mature into blood cells, but
too many blood cells are made. The type of
mature blood cell that is in excess depends on
the type of MPN.





Essential thrombocythemia (ET)
causes an excess of platelets.
Primary myelofibrosis causes an
excess of megakaryocytes that trigger
a buildup of scarring (fibrosis) in bone
marrow.

More information on the classic types of MPN
is in Chapter 2: Tests for MPN.

“

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an MPN
with too many granulocytes, a type of white
blood cell. Some people call it a classic MPN,
but it is often discussed by itself. Its treatment
is based on a cancer marker that the other
classic MPNs do not have.

MPNs are classified as a blood
cancer, but it is a cancer with a
very small c! It is easy to become
fearful and obsessed when first
diagnosed (I know I was!), but
MPNs are for most people highly
treatable. Find a doctor that is an
MPN specialist and join reputable
online MPN patient forums, it
makes all the difference."

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, 2024

Polycythemia vera (PV) causes an
excess of red blood cells.

What’s the best treatment?

Preventing complications
Your care team will watch for 3 major
complications of MPNs:

There’s no treatment for MPNs that’s best for
everyone. The best treatment is the treatment
that’s right for you. Your treatment plan should
follow best practices—cancer care based on
science and expert consensus. The following
chapters explain the best practices of testing
for and treating classic MPNs.

Abnormal bleeding



Blood clots



Disease progression

Abnormal bleeding (hemorrhage) and blood
clots (thrombi) are most common in PV and
ET. But both also occur with myelofibrosis.
Abnormal bleeding is often minor but can be
severe. Blood clots can block blood vessels.
They can be fatal, though this is rare.

Treatment may not be needed
MPNs are chronic cancers. Chronic cancers
can be stable for several years and typically
progress slowly. Treatment may not be needed
right away or ever, but these blood cancers are
not typically cured.

MPNs can progress into more severe diseases
but most do not. ET and PV can progress
into myelofibrosis. Though rare, MPNs can
progress into acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
When MPNs progress to AML, the term MPN
blast-phase (MPN-BP) is commonly used.

People with MPN often live many years with
proper treatment. Many people have nearnormal lifespans. But for some, the cancer
worsens more quickly. The course of the
cancer depends on the MPN type, features of
the cancer, and your age and health.

Preventing complications is discussed in
Chapter 4: Clotting in PV and ET and in
Chapter 5: Myelofibrosis.

Relief of symptoms
MPNs cause a wide range of symptoms―
fatigue, headaches, and abdominal pain, just
to name a few. In recent years, valid surveys
to assess symptoms have been developed. To
learn more, read Chapter 3: Symptoms and
surveys.

Advocate for yourself
You are a member of your cancer care team.
Discuss the recommendations in this book with
your team. Together, you can make a care plan
that’s best for you.

The burden of MPN symptoms varies greatly
between people. For many people, though,
the burden is intense and reduces their quality
of life. Symptoms may restrict everyday
activities and work hours. Relief of symptoms
is discussed in Chapter 6: Supportive care.

There is a list of suggested questions in
Chapter 7 to ask your team. You’re more likely
to get the care you want by asking questions
and making decisions with your team.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms, also called
MPNs, are a type of blood cancer. MPNs
cause high numbers of blood cells.

You need to be your own advocate,
particularly since this is a rare
cancer and the significant majority
of healthcare experts are not
aware of MPNs. If I didn't observe
my own blood work, push for
appointments with hematologists,
and not stop asking 'why,' I still
would not know about my diagnosis
and may not have learned until it
was potentially too late."

The three classic MPNs are polycythemia
vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia
(ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
MPNs are chronic cancers, which means
they worsen slowly.
With treatment, most people live a long
life, though many struggle with intense
symptoms. For others, the cancer
may worsen quickly or cause a fatal
complication.

MPNs rarely run in families. It is very rare to
be born with an abnormal gene that causes an
MPN. Most people acquire changes in genes
after birth that may lead to an MPN.

Much diagnosis and treatment
is blood work number based
and can be done virtually. Get
a second opinion or third. Had I

Some other types of cancers and health
conditions do run in families. Be prepared
to discuss the health problems of your close
blood relatives. These include your siblings,
parents, and grandparents.

features of blood cells can be a clue as to what
disease you have.

Blood tests can measure blood cells, proteins,
and chemicals in the bloodstream. They are
commonly used to screen for disease and to
plan treatment of blood cancers.

A blood smear can also show if there are
immature blood cells called blasts in the blood.
Normally, blasts are only in bone marrow, but
sometimes myelofibrosis forces them out.

Some blood tests are done with a machine
while others need a pathologist to complete.
A pathologist is a doctor who’s an expert in
tissues and cells.

Metabolic panel and liver tests
A comprehensive metabolic panel measures
up to 14 types of chemicals that come from
your organs. It is a screening test for many
diseases. It can also show if the MPN is
affecting your organs, such as your bones and
liver.

For MPN, a doctor called a hematopathologist
may be part of your care team. A
hematopathologist is an expert at diagnosing
cancers of blood and immune cells.

Likewise, liver function tests are used to
assess if the MPN is affecting your liver. These
tests measure a yellow-colored fluid called bile
and liver proteins and enzymes.

Complete blood count with
differential
A complete blood count (CBC) with differential
is a very common lab test. Test results include:








Lactate dehydrogenase and uric
acid

Counts of white blood cells, red blood
cells, and platelets

Most cells have a protein called lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) and a chemical called
uric acid. High levels of LDH and uric acid
may be signs of myelofibrosis. During certain
phases, myelofibrosis causes many blood cells
to die. Dying blood cells release LDH and uric
acid.

The percentage of red blood cells in blood
(called hematocrit)
The amount of a protein called
hemoglobin within red blood cells
Counts of the most common types of
white blood cells in the blood—basophils,
neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and
lymphocytes

Erythropoietin and iron
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone made by
the kidneys. It helps to make red blood cells,
and iron is needed to make hemoglobin in red
blood cells. Blood tests of EPO and iron help
diagnose PV. In PV, high red blood cell counts
suppress EPO levels. Also, iron levels may be
low despite having high hemoglobin levels.

Blood smear
A pathologist will inspect your blood using a
microscope. This is known as a blood smear.
With a microscope, a pathologist can see
the size and shape of blood cells. Abnormal

Bone marrow tests

Other blood tests
Other blood tests are sometimes needed.
People who will have a treatment called
an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(HCT) need human leukocyte antigen testing.
To learn more about allogeneic HCT, read
Chapter 5: Myelofibrosis.

Bone marrow is the soft center in the middle of
most bones. It is like a sponge holding liquid
and cells.
A bone marrow biopsy removes a core sample
of marrow. A bone marrow aspiration removes
liquid and cells. These procedures are often
done at the same time. They’re performed on
the back of the hip bone. You may receive an
injected pain blocker or light sedative to relax
you beforehand.

Coagulation testing may be done to assess
how well your blood clots. Some people are
diagnosed with acquired von Willebrand
syndrome (aVWS) or another blood clotting
disorder based on these tests.

A pathologist will inspect your bone marrow
using a microscope. This is known as bone
marrow histology. Histology can detect
abnormal numbers of bone marrow cells. It can
also show how much bone marrow is scarred
(fibrosis).

Removing bone marrow
samples
Samples of your bone
marrow might be removed
and tested for diagnosis or
treatment planning. A bone
marrow aspiration removes
a small amount of liquid
bone marrow. A bone marrow
biopsy removes a small piece
of bone with marrow. These
procedures are often done on
the back of the hip one after
the other.

prognosis if it wasn’t done before. A prognosis
predicts how the cancer will behave and
respond to treatment.

Biomarker tests look for biological clues, or
markers, of cancer. Molecular tests are a type
of biomarker test that look for abnormal genes
called mutations. Some people call them
genetic tests. Cytogenetic tests show if there
are abnormal chromosomes.

Biomarker tests for abnormal
chromosomes
Cytogenetics are useful for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Results can help with
identifying MPN subtypes, grading bone
marrow fibrosis, and assessing the prognosis
of the cancer.

Biomarker test for CML mutation
The hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) is the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and
multiplex RT-PCR are molecular tests that
detect BCR-ABL1 in either a blood or bone
marrow sample. If BCR-ABL1 is missing, CML
is ruled out.

A picture of chromosomes called a karyotype
is used for cytogenetics. A FISH test may
be done, too. These tests are done on bone
marrow aspirate or a blood sample.

Biomarker tests for MPN mutations
If CML is ruled out, molecular testing is used to
look for markers of classic MPNs.

I'm happy I found the right

2 Tests for MPN » How to diagnose MPNs

How to diagnose MPNs

To be considered PMF, the minor criterion—
another sign of myelofibrosis—must be
detected with blood tests. This sign may
be low red blood cell counts or hemoglobin
(anemia), high levels of white blood cells or
LDH, or an enlarged spleen. Another sign of
overt PMF is blasts in a blood smear.

The International Consensus Classification
(ICC) and World Health Organization (WHO)
have created diagnostic standards for MPN.
These standards include major criteria and
related minor criteria. A pathologist will use the
tests described in this chapter to decide if the
criteria for an MPN are met.

Polycythemia vera
The first major criterion for PV is a high
hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red cell mass. Your
health care provider may reorder blood work to
check that a high level persists.

Primary myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis is called primary myelofibrosis
or PMF if it is the only MPN that you have
had. There are 2 stages of PMF based on the
amount of scarring (fibrosis) in bone marrow:


Prefibrotic PMF (pre-PMF or early PMF)



Overt PMF





The first criterion of myelofibrosis is a high
number of abnormal megakaryocytes in bone
marrow. The bone marrow in pre-PMF has
either minor or no scarring, whereas there is
major scarring in overt PMF. In pre-PMF, the
number of bone marrow cells is higher than
normal, although at times the production of red
blood cells may be low.



Myelofibrosis can only be diagnosed after
other blood cancers have been excluded. The
second criterion requires other types of MPN,
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and other
myeloid neoplasms to be ruled out.

Hematocrit is the percentage of red
blood cells in blood. Hematocrit is high
when greater than 49 percent in those
born male and 48 percent in those born
female.
Red cell mass is the volume of red blood
cells in the blood. It is a nuclear medicine
test and is not often used to diagnose
MPNs. The red cell mass is high when
it is 25 percent greater than the normal
value.

The second criterion for PV is a high number
of myeloid blood cells compared to fat cells in
bone marrow. This is called hypercellularity.
Myeloid blood cells include red blood cells,
platelets, and granulocytes. For more
information on blood cells, read Chapter 1:
MPN basics.

The third criterion is having a JAK2, CALR, or
MPL mutation. A JAK2 mutation is the most
common, and a CALR mutation is the second
most common. About 1 out of 10 people with
PMF don’t have any of these three mutations.
In these cases, the MPN is described as triple
negative.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, 2024

Hemoglobin is a protein within red blood
cells. Hemoglobin is high when it is
greater than 16.5 g/dL if assigned male at
birth or 16.0 g/dL for female.

The third criterion for PV is a JAK2 mutation,
but it is not required for diagnosis. Almost

16

2 Tests for MPN » How to diagnose MPNs

everyone with PV has a JAK2 V617F mutation.
The few people without this mutation most
often have a JAK2 exon 12 mutation instead.

Know your MPN

3 What is the subtype?
3 What are the mutations, if any?
3 What treatment are you on?

If no JAK2 mutation is found, PV is diagnosed
if the first two major criteria are met, and you
have low EPO levels (the minor criterion).

It is important to tell any clinician who
treats you about the MPN and treatment.
Otherwise, you could receive care that is
harmful.

Essential thrombocythemia
The first major criterion for ET is a high platelet
count. A high platelet count is 450 × 109/L or
above.

“

The second criterion is a high number of
abnormal megakaryocytes in bone marrow.
Megakaryocytes in ET are larger than normal.
Their nucleus—the brain of the cell—has more
divisions (lobes) than normal.

My friend, a nurse, advised that
I get a second opinion for my ET
diagnosis. He went with me, and
at the end he asked, 'What's the
prognosis?' Doc says, 'I understand
you ride a road bike and stay in
shape. More than likely, if you
follow your hematologist advice,
you'll live 20 years, unless you get
hit by a bus.' That was 12 years
ago, and I am still pedaling. I am
almost 79 years old."

ET can only be diagnosed after other blood
cancers have been excluded. The third
criterion requires other types of MPN, MDS,
and other myeloid neoplasms to be ruled out.
The fourth criterion is having a JAK2, CALR,
or MPL mutation, but it is not required for
diagnosis. A JAK2 mutation is the most
common, and a CALR mutation is the second
most common. About 1 out of 10 people with
ET don’t have any of these three mutations.
In these cases, the MPN is described as triple
negative.
When the fourth criterion is not met, ET can be
diagnosed based on the minor criteria. These
criteria include another genetic marker or no
underlying cause of the high platelet count.
Other causes of high platelet counts include
low iron, chronic inflammation, and effects of
medicine.

Symptoms and test results differ between
the early, middle, and late phases of
an MPN. Health care providers need
to know what each MPN looks like as it
progresses.

The pathologist will identify the MPN subtype
when possible. Although rare, there are
times when the MPN subtype is not clear.
These cancers are called MPN, not otherwise

The classic MPNs can have very similar

Be ready to tell your care team about any
health problems and treatments you’ve
had in your lifetime.
Your health care provider will examine
your body for signs of disease. The exam
will include touching parts of your body to
see if anything feels abnormal.
You will also need to provide samples of
blood, bone marrow, or both. Your blood
and bone marrow will be sent to a lab to
be tested for signs of MPNs and other
diseases.
Despite criteria to diagnose MPN types,
diagnosis can be challenging. Most MPNs
have a genetic marker. These markers
include JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations.

MPN symptoms

ET symptoms

A symptom is a physical or mental change that
may be related to a disease. Most people with
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) have
symptoms related to the cancer. Symptom
burden is often severe even in people
with polycythemia vera (PV) or essential
thrombocythemia (ET).

In ET, high numbers of platelets can cause
headaches, vision problems, dizziness,
high-pitched ringing in the ears (tinnitus),
and numbness and tingling in the limbs
(paresthesia). Other microvascular symptoms
include poor concentration, sleep problems,
and sexual problems.

MPNs cause a wide range of symptoms.
Generally, there are 3 types of symptoms that
your care team will plan treatment with:


Microvascular symptoms



Enlarged spleen symptoms



Constitutional symptoms

Enlarged spleen symptoms
Among people with MPNs, bone marrow may
become unable to make enough healthy blood
cells. When the bone marrow makes too few
blood cells, other parts of the body may start
producing the cells instead.

These symptoms are described next. For
information on treating symptoms, read
Chapter 6: Supportive care.

The spleen is a very common backup to bone
marrow for blood cell production. It is a small
organ to the left of the stomach.
When the spleen supplies the body with blood
cells, it gets bigger. An enlarged spleen is
called splenomegaly. Your health care provider

and muscle. The rise in body temperature may
trigger excessive sweating called night sweats.

An enlarged spleen causes symptoms
because it presses against other body parts.
It may partly fill the space where the stomach
is. In turn, you will feel full quicker when eating
(early satiety).

Bone pain in the limbs may be due to the
rapid making of blood cells, which causes
inflammation in the covering of the bone.
Another common cytokine-related symptom is
itchy skin (pruritus). Itchy skin is triggered by
water, so it can interfere with body hygiene.

The spleen may press against the diaphragm,
which prevents the lung from fully expanding.
In turn, you may have shortness of breath or a
cough.

“

An enlarged spleen can also cause discomfort
or pain if it presses on a nerve. Many people
become less active due to these symptoms.

The impact of MPNs can be quite
wide-ranging. There is more to
these conditions than the risk of
thrombosis. The secondary or
constitutional symptoms can be
more problematic and deserve
equal attention."

Constitutional symptoms
Constitutional symptoms are the result of a
condition that affects the whole body. They are
very general and can be caused by more than
one factor.
In MPNs, experts believe that constitutional
symptoms are related to high levels of small
proteins called cytokines. Cytokines trigger
inflammation—a defensive reaction—in the
body.
One of the most common constitutional
symptoms of MPNs is fatigue. Cancer-related
fatigue is a distressing, ongoing tiredness that
limits one’s ability to do day-to-day tasks. It is a
major contributor to poor quality of life among
people living with an MPN.
You may lose weight and have fevers because
an MPN can cause a rapid breakdown of fat

clots are prevented.

What is a blood clot?

Blood clots are the most frequent, sometimes
life-threatening, complication of PV and ET.
As blood clots worsen, they can block enough
blood flow (thrombosis) to cause symptoms.
Blocked blood flow can cause organ damage
or failure, including heart attack, or a stroke.

A blood clot is a gel-like clump of blood.
Normally, blood clots develop to stop bleeding
and then dissolve when the bleeding is over.
Sometimes a blood clot can form inside a
blood vessel when there is no bleeding. This
type of clot is called a thrombus (or thrombi if

prior blood clots, and a JAK2 V617F mutation.

Preventing blood clots

Calculating clot risk

The plan to prevent clots differs between
people. Your plan will be based on what MPN
type you have, your risk of clots, and if you
have symptoms of an MPN. Options for initial
preventive care based on risk level are listed
in Guide 3 for PV and Guide 4 for ET and
are described next.

The risk of blood clots is not the same for
everyone living with an myeloproliferative
neoplasm (MPN). Your health care provider
will assess your risk and plan treatment based
on your risk level. This process is called risk
stratification.
People with PV are stratified into one of two
groups—low or high risk. Risk is based on age
and history of blood clots.

Your cardiovascular system consists of
your heart, blood vessels, and blood.
Cardiovascular risk factors are things that
will likely damage this system. Having a

well among people with ET, but not everyone
with ET needs it.

Smoking blocks the action of
aspirin. If you smoke, you’ll
have to quit for aspirin to
work. Ask your health care
providers about counseling
and medicine to help you quit.

Aspirin can cause more harm than good
in people with very-low-risk ET, especially
those with acquired von Willebrand syndrome
(aVWS).
Bleeding is a side effect of aspirin for some
people. People with aVWS are likely to have
bleeding because their blood doesn’t clot as it
should.

receiving phlebotomy therapy, don’t take iron
supplements unless they’re prescribed by your
care team.

Higher doses should be avoided for most
people. High doses increase the chance of
bleeding in your bowels. Your blood counts
may need to be lowered before starting
aspirin. High blood counts increase the risk of
bleeding.

Blood clots aren’t as likely if the bloodstream
is less congested with red blood cells. After
phlebotomy, you may also get quick relief from
MPN symptoms—headaches, itchiness, and
blurred vision.

Phlebotomy

Your health care provider will assess how often
you need phlebotomy. Some people need it
every other week. If your hematocrit is high,
you may need it once or twice a week. Once
the hematocrit and MPN symptoms are under
control, the time between phlebotomies can be
lengthened.

Hematocrit is a measure of red blood cells
compared to the total amount of blood.
Although aspirin works well for PV, the main
way to prevent blood clots is to reduce
hematocrit.
At diagnosis, hematocrit is often above 55
percent (55%). Hematocrit should be below 45
percent for most people. Some people need a
target of below 42 percent.

Cytoreductive therapy
People who are highly likely to get blood
clots may take medication that lowers blood
counts. These cytoreductive therapies are also
sometimes given to relieve symptoms when
blood clots aren’t likely.

Phlebotomy is the key strategy to reducing
hematocrit. It is a procedure that removes a
small amount of blood with a needle, like when
donating blood.

Some cytoreductive therapies are preferred
by NCCN experts. Preferred therapies work
better, are safer, or cost less than other options
or there is better research supporting their use.

Phlebotomy works by removing the ironcarrying red blood cells from the blood.
With less iron in the body, bone marrow
makes fewer red blood cells. If you are

Hydroxyurea
Hydroxyurea (Hydrea) has been a standard
cytoreductive therapy for a long time. It’s a
preferred initial treatment in high-risk PV and
ET. For many people, it lowers blood counts
and prevents blood clots for years.

Anagrelide
Anagrelide (Agrylin) is an antiplatelet medicine
for high-risk ET. It lowers the number of
platelets that your body makes. Anagrelide is a
capsule that is taken twice a day. It may cause
headaches, digestive problems, anemia, and
heart palpitations.

Hydroxyurea works by stopping new cells from
being made. It is made as a capsule, so you
can take it at home. It is given in low doses, so
many people can tolerate its side effects.

Ruxolitinib
Ruxolitinib is sometimes useful for highrisk PV. It is a medicine that is called a JAK
inhibitor. Read more about ruxolitinib in
Chapter 5: Myelofibrosis.

Hydroxyurea can cause below-normal blood
counts, fatigue, skin changes, diarrhea,
constipation, and skin cancer.

“

Interferon alpha
Interferon alpha naturally exists in your body
and helps fight infections. It can also be
created in the lab as a treatment. Interferon
curbs the making of blood cells in bone
marrow.

I found out in 2018 at my annual
physical that my platelet count was
elevated and that led to a diagnosis
of ET with JAK 2 genetic mutation.
I have no symptoms and my only
treatment is two low-dose aspirin
per day. I don't believe that this
needs to be called blood cancer.
I tell people that I have a blood
disorder so it isn't so frightening."

The two interferons used to treat MPNs are:



Pegylated interferon, usually called
peginterferon (PEGASYS), is a treatment
option for high-risk PV and ET. It is
sometimes given to people who are
younger, pregnant, or delay taking similar
medicines like hydroxyurea.
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (BESREMi) is
a preferred treatment option for high-risk
PV.

You can take interferon at home. It is injected
under the skin every 2 weeks. Over time, it
may be needed less often.
Interferon can cause flu-like illness, joint
pain, fatigue, itching, throat swelling,
musculoskeletal pain, and depression.

Consider meeting with an obstetrician who’s
an expert in high-risk pregnancies before
getting pregnant. This doctor can assess for
and manage health risks during pregnancy.

If you need an anticoagulant (commonly
referred to as a blood thinner) while
breastfeeding, the safe ones to take are
unfractionated heparin, LMWH, warfarin, and
fondaparinux. Direct oral anticoagulants should
be avoided.

Pregnancy is at high risk if you have had a
blood clot, bleeding due to PV or ET, or related
problems during prior pregnancies.

If you have PV, the hematocrit target is based
on the trimester. Hematocrit should be under
41 percent (41%) for the first trimester, under
38 percent for the second trimester, and under
39 percent during the third trimester.

Pregnancy care for standard risk includes:

Blood clots and surgery

PV and ET checkups

Surgery increases the chance for blood clots
and bleeding. Your surgeon may contact your
MPN team to get your health history.

After starting preventive care, you will need to
meet with your care team often. Your team will
assess if the MPN is causing health problems
and if it is progressing. They will also assess
the results of treatment.

Your surgeon needs to know about any blood
clots, bleeding, and your medications.

Visits with your care team

Before surgery, your blood counts should be
close to normal to prevent blood clots and
bleeding.






During visits, you will be asked about new or
worsening symptoms and new diagnoses.
You may be given a symptom survey called
the MPN-10 to complete. For information on
treating symptoms, read Chapter 6: Supportive
care.

You may be put on anticoagulants and
cytoreductive therapy before surgery.
People with PV may need more
phlebotomies to stay below 45 percent for
3 months before surgery.

If you have PV, your health care provider will
want to know how many phlebotomies you’ve
had since the last visit.

If the surgery has a high risk for venous
thromboembolism, you may be given lowmolecular-weight heparin.

Your health care provider will perform a
physical exam of your body. The size of your
spleen and liver will be checked. Your health
care provider will look for signs of blood clots
and bleeding.

Just before surgery, you will need to stop
taking some medicines. Aspirin is stopped 1
week before surgery.
You may stay on cytoreductive therapy until
the surgery unless your surgeon tells you
to stop. The time to stop an anticoagulant
depends on how long it stays in your body.

Blood work may be needed. Your health
care provider will monitor your blood counts
and other blood values. Liver and kidney
functioning tests may be ordered as well. Now
and then, a peripheral blood smear may be
done. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
may be needed to rule out progression to
myelofibrosis.

After surgery, you will be monitored for blood
clots and bleeding. You may restart your
medicines if the bleeding risk is low. Aspirin is
often restarted 24 hours after surgery.

4 Clotting in PV and ET » PV and ET progression » Key points

PV and ET progression



PV and ET can progress into myelofibrosis.
Progression happens in about 1 out of 10
people with PV or ET. It is unknown why these
MPNs progress. Researchers are studying the
role of inflammation and abnormal genes.



The risk of progression increases the longer
you have PV or ET. It is rare for these MPNs
to progress right into the blast phase of
myelofibrosis, which is like acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). If PV and ET do progress,
they typically progress into chronic-phase
myelofibrosis and then into advanced phases.



Once progression starts, it may be slow and
take place over many years. An early sign of
progression is a steady decline in the need for
treatment to reduce blood counts. Your health
care provider may reduce or stop treatment
to see if your blood counts stop falling. If they
don’t, you may have myelofibrosis. Treatment
of myelofibrosis is discussed in Chapter 5.





If PV or ET is getting worse, your
treatment may be changed. The next
treatment will depend on the current clot
risk level, your prior treatment, and if
there is progression to myelofibrosis.

“

People with polycythemia vera (PV) and
essential thrombocythemia (ET) are prone
to getting blood clots. With preventive
care, most people live for many years.
Preventive care is based on your risk for
blood clots. Having a healthy heart and
blood vessels is a goal for everyone.
Aspirin is also commonly used to prevent
clots.
For PV, phlebotomy is performed to
reduce hematocrit. For high-risk PV/ET,
cytoreductive treatment may be an option
to reduce blood counts.

Predicting prognosis

Myelofibrosis is almost hidden
in some people but rapidly

The prognosis is the likely course and outcome
of the myelofibrosis you have. Experts and
care teams use risk stratification scoring
systems to assess prognosis.

progresses in others. Its treatment
is discussed in this chapter
including the newest ways to treat

Scoring systems

myelofibrosis with anemia.

For PMF, NCCN experts prefer the MIPPS-70
and MIPSS-70 Plus Version 2.0. These scoring
systems are for people who are 70 years of
age or under and require broad molecular
testing. Other scoring systems for people of
any age are the DIPSS and DIPSS-Plus.

Types of myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis is a blood cancer that causes
scarring of the bone marrow, called fibrosis. It
can occur in people with or without a history of
a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).

The risk stratification system used for post-PV
and post-ET myelofibrosis is the MYSEC-PM.
Risk is based on your medical information.
Points are given for each response that
conveys a risk of poor outcomes. Based on the
total number of points, people are assigned a
risk level.

If myelofibrosis is a person's first MPN, it is
called primary myelofibrosis (PMF). It can
also occur when polycythemia vera (PV) or
essential thrombocythemia (ET) progresses.
In these cases, it is called secondary
myelofibrosis or post-PV and post-ET
myelofibrosis.

Ask your provider what your risk level is and
what system was used to calculate it. Risk
levels for each system are listed on the next
page in Guide 7.

Myelofibrosis greatly differs between people.
It differs in terms of its course, speed of
progression, and symptoms.

NCCN risk groups

Treatment is partly based on how aggressive
the myelofibrosis is predicted to be.
Myelofibrosis slowly progresses in many
people. It can be stable for many years.

NCCN experts divide the total points into 2 risk
groups—lower and higher—to plan treatment.
In the next section, treatment for lower- and
higher-risk myelofibrosis without anemia is
discussed. But most people with myelofibrosis
have anemia. If you do, read the section in
this chapter called Treating myelofibrosis with
anemia.

For others, the MPN is more active. The first
step of treatment planning is to assess the
prognosis.

5 Myelofibrosis » Treating myelofibrosis without anemia

Clinical trial

Which JAK inhibitor is recommended?
For lower-risk myelofibrosis, ruxolitinib
has been often used to treat symptoms when
needed. Pacritinib is an option for when
platelet levels are very low. Momelotinib may
be an option, but more research is needed
among people with lower-risk myelofibrosis.

If available, a clinical trial is recommended. A
clinical trial is a type of medical research study.
For more information on clinical trials, read the
section in this chapter called Participating in
clinical trials.

Watch and wait

For higher-risk myelofibrosis, NCCN
experts recommend specific JAK inhibitors
based on platelet levels.

Lower-risk myelofibrosis is likely to be stable
or slowly progress. People with lower-risk
myelofibrosis that isn’t causing symptoms may
start “watch and wait.” Also called observation
or watchful waiting, watch and wait is a
period of testing to assess for changes in
myelofibrosis. Treatment may be started if
symptoms appear.

Ruxolitinib, momelotinib, and fedratinib are
recommended when platelet levels range from
low to high. Pacritinib studies in this platelet
range are needed.
When platelet levels are very low, NCCN
experts prefer pacritinib for treatment.
Momelotinib needs to be studied more among
people with very low platelets.

Cytoreductive therapy
Cytoreductive therapy is an option for lowerrisk myelofibrosis that is causing symptoms.
The therapies used for myelofibrosis are
peginterferon alfa-2a or hydroxyurea. More
information on these therapies is in Chapter 4:
Clotting in PV and ET.

What does treatment involve?
JAK inhibitors are a pill you take at home.
Your health care provider will determine
which medications and dosing is right for you
and adjust as needed. Don’t stop taking the
medicine unless your health care provider
directs you to do so.

JAK inhibitors
JAK is a cell protein that helps cells grow. It is
key to blood stem cells developing into mature
blood cells. JAK is overactive in people with
myelofibrosis whether or not there is a JAK
mutation.

Allogeneic HCT
A hematopoietic stem cell is a cell that
develops into every type of blood cell. In
myelofibrosis, hematopoietic stem cells and
bone marrow are diseased.

JAK inhibitors stop JAK and reduce the
number of new blood cells being made. In turn,
they reduce spleen size and core symptoms.
Ruxolitinib (Jakafi), fedratinib (INREBIC),
pacritinib (Vonjo), and momelotinib (Ojjaara)
are JAK inhibitors.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, 2024

An allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(HCT) uses donor cells to form healthy bone
marrow and blood cells in you. It extends life
and may cure myelofibrosis.

40

5 Myelofibrosis » Treating myelofibrosis without anemia

An allogeneic HCT is not safe for everyone. It
is an intense treatment, so many people can’t
get it. A transplant specialist will assess if you
can have a transplant. The specialist will also
assess donor options

cells. It also weakens the immune system,
so your body does not kill the donor cells.
3. Next, you’ll receive the donor cells
through a transfusion. A transfusion is
a slow injection of blood products into a
vein. New, healthy blood cells will form
over the next 2 to 4 weeks. This is called
engraftment.

When is an allogeneic HCT an option?
Allogeneic HCT is rarely used to treat lowerrisk myelofibrosis but may be an option if
platelets are low or the cancer cells have
complex cytogenetics. A complex karyotype is
when there are 3 or more unrelated defects in
chromosomes that occur in 2 or more cells.

4. You’ll have to be extra careful to avoid
germs for the first few weeks after the
transplant. That’s because your infectionfighting immune system will be almost
gone. You may be given antibiotics to
prevent or treat infection. You may receive
medicine called immunosuppressants to
prevent GVHD.

Everyone with higher-risk myelofibrosis
should receive a transplant evaluation since a
transplant is the only chance for a cure. The
benefits of a transplant may be worth the risks
for PMF that has high-risk mutations, such as
ASXL1, EZH2, and RAS.

More information
about GVHD is
available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides
for Cancer app.

What does treatment involve?
There are 4 steps to receiving an allogeneic
HCT, which can be a grueling process. You
may stay on a JAK inhibitor to reduce spleen
size and improve symptoms until you get a
transplant.

“

Your care team will give you detailed
information about an allogeneic HCT and
answer your questions. To give you a general
idea of the process, here's a brief description:

Do it for the little things...
grandchildren, that is.
Had I not undergone the stem cell
transplant I wouldn't be here to
enjoy them."

1. Your blood will be tested for cell proteins
called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs).
A donor’s HLAs must be a near-perfect
match to yours for a transplant to work.
Even with a near-perfect match, donor
cells may attack your body. This is called
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
2. You’ll receive a treatment called
conditioning to kill your bone marrow

Treating myelofibrosis with
anemia

may be reduced, or the treatment may be
paused or stopped. There are other options
that don’t require avoiding or stopping JAK
inhibitors.

Anemia is a term for low levels of hemoglobin.
Most people with myelofibrosis develop
anemia within 1 year after diagnosis. Anemia
may cause you to feel tired and cold or look
pale. These symptoms are caused by cells not
getting enough oxygen.



If you have anemia, your provider will make a
treatment plan based on whether you:







Have anemia for reasons other than
myelofibrosis
Are taking a JAK inhibitor now


Have anemia symptoms or myelofibrosis
symptoms

Depending on the causes of the anemia, your
care team might prescribe supplements to
replace low iron, folate, or vitamin B12 levels.
Treatment options for anemia related to
myelofibrosis are listed in Guide 9.

A second option is to take pacritinib.
Anemia may not be severe during
pacritinib because it doesn’t suppress the
number of new blood cells being made
and it may even increase hemoglobin.
For people taking ruxolitinib, the third
option is to keep taking it and start
anemia treatment. Luspatercept-aamt,
an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, or
danazol can be added to ruxolitinib to
treat anemia. But these add-ons don’t
improve anemia for a prolonged time in
many people or may not help at all.

Red blood cell drugs

Clinical trials

If a JAK inhibitor isn’t needed, you may receive
anemia treatment that increases the number of
red blood cells. Such anemia drugs include:

NCCN experts prefer clinical trials for
treatment of anemia. Further research is
needed to test current treatments in more
people. And despite recent improvements in
treatment, better treatment is still needed. For

5 Myelofibrosis » Treating advanced phases of myelofibrosis

Treating advanced phases
of myelofibrosis

Treatment planning
Right after progression is confirmed, you
and your care team will discuss treatment.
Treatment may include chemotherapy or
chemotherapy followed by an allogeneic HCT.
If a transplant is an option, you will be referred
to a transplant specialist.

Myelofibrosis can progress to an accelerated
or blast phase. Over 20 years, progression
occurs in about 1 in 20 people with PV or ET.
For PMF, it's about 3 out of 20 people.
The marker of progression is a high
percentage of immature blood cells, called
myeloblasts, in the bone marrow or the
bloodstream. Myeloblasts (simply called
blasts) are usually only in bone marrow.

Clinical trial
Whether or not you will get a transplant, NCCN
experts recommend clinical trials. Ask your
treatment team if there is an open clinical trial
that’s a good fit for you. For more information
on clinical trials, read the section in this
chapter called Participating in clinical trials.

Normally, the blast count in bone marrow
is less than 5 percent. In the accelerated
phase of myelofibrosis, the blast count
is between 10 and 19 percent. The blast
phase of myelofibrosis [also called postMPN acute myeloid leukemia (AML)] has at
least a 20 percent blast count. AML may be
diagnosed with less than 20 percent blasts if
chromosomes have certain abnormal changes.

Low-intensity chemotherapy
When a transplant isn’t an option, low-intensity
chemotherapy is often used for treatment.
One type of low-intensity chemotherapy is
hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine
and decitabine. Learn about other low-intensity
chemotherapy options for AML available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Lab tests
To confirm progression, lab tests on bone
marrow are needed. If bone marrow can’t
be removed, blood samples may be used.
You may know some of the lab tests used
for progression as they are used for MPN
diagnosis (see Chapter 2):

information is needed to see if people with
MPNs benefit from it.

NCCN experts recommend a clinical trial
for many people with MPNs. A clinical trial
is a type of medical research study. It tests
potential new ways of fighting cancer and
its negative effects in people. After being
developed and tested in a laboratory, potential
new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied
in humans. If found to be safe and effective
in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment
approach may be approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).

Induction therapy
Some people who are well enough are treated
with induction therapy, which involves a
combination of drugs. The goal of induction
therapy is to rid the marrow of blasts.
Chemotherapy used to treat AML is often used
for induction.

Allogeneic HCT
If you’re already taking a JAK inhibitor, it may
be continued until you get a transplant.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments
and clinical trials. Talk to your care team about
whether a clinical trial may make sense for you.

For advanced myelofibrosis, the first step of
care is to receive induction therapy before a
transplant. Transplants are more successful
when induction therapy has good results.
Instead of induction, some people take a
hypomethylating agent with or without a JAK
inhibitor.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

There are several steps to receiving an
allogeneic transplant. These steps are
described earlier in this chapter in the section
called Treating myelofibrosis without anemia.

early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase 2 trials study how well the drug

5 Myelofibrosis » Myelofibrosis checkups » Changing treatment

Treatment response

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

In research, there are standards for assessing
the results of medicines. Know that your
treatment may be working but may not match
these standards. Your health care provider
will assess treatment results mostly based on
whether symptoms are improving.

Changing treatment
Your treatment will likely not change if
symptoms improve and your blood counts are
acceptable. Reasons to change treatment
include little to no symptom relief or worsening
symptoms. Also, worsening blood counts or
signs of progression may trigger a change in
treatment.

Myelofibrosis checkups
After starting treatment, you will need to meet
with your care team often. NCCN experts
advise having a visit every 3 to 6 months for
lower-risk myelofibrosis under observation.
You may need visits more often if receiving
active treatment, such as JAK inhibitors.

Treatment decisions may be guided by
molecular testing. Testing may find new
mutations since the last testing was done.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests
on biopsy samples can detect higher-risk
mutations, such as ASXL1, EZH2, and
RAS. These mutations suggest that the
myelofibrosis is likely to progress and a
transplant may be needed.

Visits with your care team
During visits, you will be asked about new or
worsening symptoms and new diagnoses.
You may be given a symptom survey called
the MPN-10 to complete. For information on
treating symptoms, read Chapter 6: Supportive
care.

If myelofibrosis worsens but doesn’t progress,
the next treatment is based on the current risk
level and prior treatment. New anemia may be
treated with medications that improve blood
counts.

Your health care provider will perform a
physical exam of your body. The size of your
spleen and liver will be checked.
Blood work will be ordered. Your health care
provider will monitor your blood counts and
other blood values. You may undergo a bone
marrow biopsy and aspiration if symptoms
worsen or there are signs of possible
progression.

Myelofibrosis is a blood cancer that
results in scarring of the bone marrow
(fibrosis). How quickly it worsens greatly
differs between people.

The initial diagnosis and new
reality can be very overwhelming
since not much is known about
MPNs. While myelofibrosis is very
rare, there are helpful resources
from MPN research and education
organizations as well as informal
patient networks that provide the
opportunity to share questions,
fears, symptoms, and treatments. It
is comforting to know there is new
research and potential treatment
options emerging that should help
improve and extend our lives."

The first step of treatment planning
is to assess the prognosis using
a risk stratification system. NCCN
recommendations for treatment are based
on two risk levels—lower and higher.
If you don’t have anemia, watch-and-wait
is an option for lower-risk myelofibrosis
that isn’t causing symptoms. Symptoms
and higher-risk myelofibrosis are often
treated with a JAK inhibitor. Some people
are healthy enough to get an allogeneic
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) .
If you have anemia, treatment may
include a JAK inhibitor, medication that
increases red blood cell counts, or both.
Standard treatment of anemia that’s
causing symptoms is a red blood cell
transfusion.
Advanced phases of myelofibrosis are
often treated with chemotherapy, which
can vary in intensity. Chemotherapy may
be followed by an allogeneic transplant for
some people.
NCCN experts recommend clinical trials
for people with MPNs. A clinical trial tests
new ways of stopping cancer or reducing
symptoms in people. Ask your care team
if there are clinical trials that are a good fit
for you.
You will meet with your care team often
after diagnosis. During visits, the status of
the cancer will be checked as well as how
you feel.

People with MPNs are at increased risk for
bleeding. Also called hemorrhaging, bleeding
is often mild and occurs when platelet counts
are high or low.

Supportive care is very important for all people
with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). It is
not just for people at the end of life who need
hospice.

Bleeding occurs most often in myelofibrosis
compared to polycythemia vera (PV) and
essential thrombocythemia (ET). It can be
severe, especially in people who have anemia
or low platelets.

Supportive care is sometimes called palliative
care since symptom relief is a main goal. But
supportive care addresses many other needs.
You can get help with food, financial aid, or
family counseling.

Bleeding events differ between people. Some
people bruise easily while others get nose
bleeds. Menstrual periods may be heavier than
normal. Bleeding may occur in your digestive
tract. You may see blood in your urine.

Tell your care team about your symptoms and
other needs to get the best supportive care.
A palliative care specialist may be a member

Ask your care team which types of bleeding
events need immediate medical attention.

from getting infected with cytomegalovirus
(CMV).

Causes of bleeding

Transfusions may not stop bleeding. In this
case, antifibrinolytic agents may be used.
These drugs help your blood to clot.

Normally, bleeding is stopped when cells
called platelets plug the hole in blood vessels
with help from clotting factors. A lot of bleeding
may occur when the blood doesn’t clot
properly.

Bleeding in PV and ET
Your health care provider will identify and
treat all causes of bleeding. Coagulation
tests to assess for acquired von Willebrand
Syndrome (aVWS) may be done. Levels of
von Willebrand factor may be low due to high
platelet counts.

There are several causes of bleeding in PV
and ET:









Platelets may not work correctly.
The number of platelets may be very
high. High levels of platelets may lower a
clotting factor called von Willebrand.
Prevention of blood clots with aspirin may
thin the blood too much.

Aspirin will be stopped until the platelet count
is normal. Treatment to reduce platelet counts
may be given. If you have ET, you may receive
plateletpheresis if bleeding is severe but this is
rare.

Prevention of blood clots with antiplatelet
or cytoreductive therapy may reduce
blood counts to very low levels.

Blood clots

Treating blood clots with anticoagulants
may slow down clotting time too much.

You may get a blood clot even though you took
steps to prevent it. Many blood clots are safely
managed with anticoagulants. Coagulation is
another word for blood clotting. Despite being
called blood thinners, anticoagulants slow
down the clotting of blood.

The cause of bleeding is simpler in
myelofibrosis. Bleeding is typically caused by a
low number of platelets.

Bleeding in myelofibrosis

Anticoagulants

You may receive a platelet transfusion to
prevent bleeding if your platelet count is lower
than 10,000 m3. Platelet transfusions are
also used for the treatment of bleeding. Most
white blood cells should be removed from the
donated blood. This will help prevent the blood
from attacking your body. It also prevents you

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, 2024

Research has shown that anticoagulants
help treat blood clots in general practice. But
there is little to no research on anticoagulants
in people with an MPN. It is unknown if one
anticoagulant works better than another.
It is also unknown exactly how long an
anticoagulant is needed.

51

6 Supportive care » Blood clots

Your health care provider will decide how
long you’ll take an anticoagulant based on the
severity of the blood clot. Three common types
of anticoagulants are:




betrixaban (Bevyxxa), dabigatran
(Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa), and
rivaroxaban (Xarelto).


Low-molecular-weight heparin
(LMWH) – This medicine enhances the
effect of a natural anticoagulant in your
body. It is injected into the skin and can
be taken at home.
Direct oral anticoagulants – These
pills disable proteins that help the blood
to clot. They include apixaban (Eliquis),

Vitamin K blockers – Among
these medicines, warfarin (Coumadin,
Jantoven) is the most often used. It is a
pill taken at home. Warfarin stops the liver
from using vitamin K, which is needed
to make clotting proteins. When taking
warfarin, regular testing will be necessary
to measure how quickly or slowly your
blood is clotting.

Warning signs of blood clots

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, 2024

52

6 Supportive care » Bone pain » Headaches and tinnitus » Itching

Headaches and tinnitus

Anticoagulants increase the risk of bleeding.
The risk is higher when taking aspirin
or treatment that lowers platelet counts.
Your health care provider may stop these
treatments while you’re on an anticoagulant.
People with cardiovascular risk factors
may stay on aspirin, but this may change
depending on the situation.

You may have a blood clot if you start to have
headaches. Also, sounds made by the body
and not heard by others (tinnitus), such as
high-pitch ringing, may be a symptom of a
blood clot. Tell your health care provider if you
have these symptoms.
Headaches as well as other vascular
symptoms may be relieved with low-dose
aspirin. If symptoms persist, taking aspirin
twice a day or taking an antiplatelet agent
(clopidogrel) may have better results. Aspirin
may be taken with an antiplatelet agent.
Taking an NSAID with aspirin should be done
with caution and not without your physician’s
knowledge. Always tell an urgent care or
emergency care practitioner if you are taking
daily aspirin.

Plateletpheresis
If you have a sudden life-threatening clot, you
may receive plateletpheresis. This procedure
withdraws your blood and removes platelets.
Your platelet-reduced blood will then be
returned to your body.
Plateletpheresis is rarely done as it only
slightly decreases platelets and for a short
time. It’s useful in ET when people have
life-threatening bleeds or clots or are not
responding to medication.

There are several options in addition to aspirin.
Headaches in people with PV may be relieved
with phlebotomy or ruxolitinib. For all MPNs,
cytoreduction therapy reduces headaches and
other vascular symptoms. Migraine headaches
may be prevented as well as treated with
triptans or topiramate.

Bone pain
Your health care provider will evaluate if any
bone pain is caused by the MPN. This is
needed because treatment of MPN-related
bone pain differs from treatment of joint pain.

Itching

In one MPN study, ruxolitinib stabilized bone
and muscle pain. For some people, loratadine
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) may provide relief. A low dose of
radiation may provide short-term relief of bone
pain.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, 2024

Itching (pruritus) is a common problem among
people with MPNs. It can be severe, even lifealtering.
The first approach to relieve itching is to
practice sensitive skin care. This care includes
taking short showers, using mild soap,
and moisturizing your skin. Antihistamines
(cetirizine, diphenhydramine) and topical
steroids may also be helpful.
53

6 Supportive care » Infections » Tumor lysis syndrome » Iron overload » Guidelines

If needed, the next step to relieve itching will
be based on the benefits and downsides of
treatments. Ruxolitinib relieves itching. Early
research on selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) and narrow-band ultraviolet
B shows promise.

Induction chemotherapy may cause TLS.
Induction chemotherapy is a treatment for
advanced myelofibrosis or acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). This treatment kills many
cancer cells and results in too much waste too
quickly.

Other medicines that may be tried include
peginterferon alfa-2a, gabapentin, aprepitant,
and immunosuppressant agents, such as
cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine,
mycophenolate mofetil, or dupilumab.

TLS may be prevented by high amounts of
fluids during chemotherapy. Fluids may help
clear out the cell waste. Decreasing uric acid
levels with allopurinol or rasburicase is another
option. Rasburicase may be given as the first
treatment if you have high uric acid or if it’s
affecting your kidneys.

Infections

Iron overload

You may be prone to infections because of
myelofibrosis or its treatment. Ask your health
care provider which vaccinations are safe for
you. They may prescribe the recombinant
(killed) zoster vaccine if taking a JAK inhibitor.

Iron overload is a term for too much iron in
your body. It can occur if you’ve had many
red blood cell transfusions. Iron chelation is a
type of drug that removes extra iron from your
body. It is an option at times for lower-risk
myelofibrosis. Your health care provider may
prescribe iron chelation if you’ve had more
than 20 transfusions or your blood ferritin level
is greater than 2500 ng/mL.

If you get infections often, your health
care provider may prescribe antibiotics for
prevention. Instead of antibiotics, you may
receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) if you have low
neutrophil counts. These medicines should
be used with caution because, though rare,
enlarged spleens can rupture.

Supportive care guidelines
The library of NCCN Guidelines for Patients
has several books on supportive care. These
books focus on the treatment of common
physical and emotional effects of many
cancers. One book is about healthy living and
shares recommendations for exercise, food
and supplements, and vaccines.

Tumor lysis syndrome
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurs when the
waste released by dead cells is not quickly
cleared out of the body. The waste can cause
kidney damage and severe blood electrolyte
disturbances. TLS can be life-threatening.

Distress

Fatigue

Graft-Versus-Host Disease

Everyone with cancer feels
distress at some point. It is
normal to be worried, sad,
helpless, or angry. Distress
can become severe and affect
the way you live.

A side effect of allogeneic
hematopoietic cell
transplants is graft-versushost disease. This side effect
is caused by donor cells
attacking your healthy cells.

Late and long-term effects

Cancer-related fatigue is
not the typical tiredness that
follows an active or long day.
It is a lack of energy that is
distressing, does not improve
with normal resting or sleep,
and disrupts life.

Cancer and its treatment can
cause long-term and late
effects. Long-term effects
start during treatment and
persist after treatment is
done. Less often, effects
start long after treatment has ended. Late
and long-term effects include heart disease,
fatigue, poor sleep, pain, and depression.

Palliative care

Palliative care is an approach
to health care for people
living with serious illnesses,
including cancer. It focuses
on providing relief from the
symptoms and stress of
having cancer.

Healthy living

It’s important to start or
keep a healthy lifestyle.
Healthy living may help
prevent disease and improve
well-being. Topics covered
include physical activity,
food, and vaccinations.

Nausea and vomiting

Chemotherapy can cause
nausea and vomiting.
Nausea is the feeling that
you are going to throw
up. Vomiting is forcefully
throwing up what’s in your
stomach.

Supportive care is health care that
improves quality of life. It provides
symptom relief and help for other needs.

Living with an MPN diagnosis
can be challenging. It's not a
life-defining condition but a life
altering experience. It requires
understanding and managing the
physical symptoms, such as fatigue
and pain, as well as the emotional
impact of living with a chronic
condition."

Bleeding is most common in myelofibrosis
compared to PV and ET. Treatment
options vary between MPN types to target
the cause of bleeding.
Blood clots are a focus of treatment for
PV and ET, but also occur in people
with myelofibrosis. They are treated with
anticoagulants and antiplatelet medicines.
Bone pain, headaches, tinnitus, and
itching occur across all MPNs and greatly
impact quality of life. More research is
needed to find the best treatment of these
symptoms among people with MPN.
People with myelofibrosis may develop
frequent infections, tumor lysis syndrome,
and high levels of iron. Vaccinations may
be your best defense against infections.
Fluids to clear out cell waste may prevent
TLS. Iron chelation is a treatment for high
levels of iron.
The library of NCCN Guidelines for
Patients includes books on supportive
care. These books focus on common
effects of cancer and its treatment, such
as distress, fatigue, nausea and vomiting,
and poor sleep.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest
conversation with your care team.

Second opinion
It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer should not be
ignored, there is time to have another care
provider review your test results and suggest a
treatment plan. This is called getting a second
opinion, and it’s a normal part of cancer care.
Even experts get second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
