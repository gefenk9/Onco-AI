About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology
(NCCN Guidelines®) for Cancer-Related Fatigue,
Version 2.2024 — October 30, 2023.

About cancer-related fatigue » What is cancer-related fatigue? » Screening

Fatigue is a common side effect
of most cancer treatments. But
people with cancer often suffer

Cancer survivors consider cancer-related
fatigue to be the most distressing
symptom of cancer and its treatment.
Even more distressing than pain, nausea,
or vomiting. After treatment, cancerrelated fatigue is the reason many people
are slow to return to work.

from other health or emotional
problems that are causing or
worsening their fatigue. Your care
team can help you understand
the cause of your fatigue and how
best to treat it.

Screening
Cancer-related fatigue is a subjective
(personal) experience. You are the best source
of information to your health care provider.
This is called self-reporting.

What is cancer-related
fatigue?
Experts call fatigue that happens in people
with cancer, "cancer-related fatigue." They
define it as the experience of physical,
emotional, and/or mental exhaustion related
to cancer or its treatment. Cancer-related
fatigue is not the typical tiredness that follows
an active or long day. It is a lack of energy that
is distressing, does not improve with normal
amounts of rest or sleep, and disrupts daily
life.

Ideally, your health care provider will check
your tiredness level using a checklist or
questionnaire as follows:





On a regular basis during and after
cancer treatment
As needed based on your symptoms

To decide if further evaluation is needed, your
doctor may start with a simple question, such
as “How would you rate your fatigue on a
scale of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (worst fatigue you
can imagine) over the past 7 days?” Younger
people may be asked to rate their tiredness on
a smaller scale, or just asked if they are “tired”
or “not tired.”

Many cancer survivors continue to suffer from
cancer-related fatigue for months or years after
treatment ends. This makes it hard to enjoy the
roles and activities that make life meaningful.
This often long-term problem is likely more
common than we realize. Many people think it
is a normal part of cancer treatment and do not
tell their care team about it. And doctors don’t
always make an official diagnosis or provide
treatment recommendations for cancer-related
fatigue.

Finding the cause(s) of your
fatigue

Team-based care
Help for cancer-related fatigue depends upon
the cause of your fatigue. If your care team
has done everything they can to relieve your
fatigue, it may be helpful to see a specialist.
Your health care provider may refer you to a
specialist in one or more of the following areas:

As a first step, your provider will want to learn
more about your fatigue, including:


When did it start?



How often do you have it?



Has it changed over time?



Does anything make it better or worse?



How much does it disrupt your daily life?

Physical medicine/rehabilitation –
Physical therapy is the use of exercises and
physical activities to help strengthen muscles
and restore movement. Occupational therapy
helps you overcome any physical and mental
challenges that are interfering with your daily
activities. Exercise specialists design exercise
plans in order to improve health.

The next step is to investigate whether there
are treatable causes of your symptoms.
Conditions that can cause or worsen cancerrelated fatigue include:


Anemia (low red blood cells)



Pain



Sleep-related problems



Depression



Anxiety



Diet or nutrition-related problems



Infection



Changes in thyroid function



Rheumatologic or autoimmune disorder

Mental health – Mental health providers
can help those struggling with anxiety,
depression, or other problems during and
after cancer treatment. Types of mental
health professionals include psychologists,
psychiatrists, licensed professional counselors
(LPCs), licensed clinical social workers
(LCSWs), and psychiatric nurse practitioners.
Palliative care – Care given to improve
quality of life during cancer treatment,
especially for advanced cancers. The goal is
to prevent or treat the symptoms of cancer and
its treatment, such as pain and cancer-related
fatigue. It also addresses the mental, social,
and spiritual problems faced by those with
cancer.

The best approach or treatment for your
fatigue will be guided by your doctor’s
understanding of its cause. Fatigue cannot
always be completely relieved. Your care team
can provide resources and information on
coping with this often long-term problem.

cancer care that combines normal cancer
treatment with complementary therapies such
as yoga, acupuncture, meditation, and tai chi.

What is cancer-related fatigue?

Survivorship care – This care focuses on
your health and well-being from the time you
are diagnosed until the end of life. It addresses
the physical, mental, emotional, social, and
financial effects of life after a cancer diagnosis.
Survivorship also includes care for late effects
of treatment and recurrence.







Cancer-related fatigue is an
overwhelming sense of exhaustion related
to cancer or its treatment.
It is a lack of energy that is distressing,
does not improve with normal amounts of
rest or sleep, and disrupts daily life.
Cancer-related fatigue is often a longterm problem. This makes it hard to fully
participate in the things you enjoy.

Screening






Ideally, your provider will ask about
fatigue at your first visit and on a regular
basis during and after cancer treatment.
Providers often use a single screening
question to check fatigue level and help
decide if further testing is needed.
Your care team can provide information
and resources on coping with this often
long-term problem.

Treatment for cancer-related fatigue » During and after cancer treatment

During and after cancer
treatment

The other main component is weight training,
also called resistance or strength training. It
uses a form of resistance to increase muscle
strength. The resistance can come from a
band, a free weight, or your own body weight.
Resistance training works best when you do it
on a regular basis.

The interventions (treatments) for cancerrelated fatigue that work best are described
next. If other causes of your fatigue have
been treated or ruled out, these interventions
are recommended during and after cancer
treatment.

If you have any of the health issues listed
below, caution is needed when considering
an exercise program. Ask your care team if
physical activity is safe for you before starting.

Physical activity
The treatment for cancer-related fatigue
that is most strongly supported by evidence
is exercise. Physical activity is encouraged
during and after cancer treatment.




There isn’t a specific amount that is known to
be best for everyone with cancer. Try to be
as active as possible. Evidence suggests that
those with cancer who exercise 3 to 5 hours
per week may have better outcomes and
fewer side effects, including fatigue. You can
break up the 3 to 5 hours per week into short,
10- to 15-minute sessions at different times of
day, based on your energy level. This can be
especially helpful when fatigue is severe.

A high risk of bruising or bleeding due to a
low level of platelets (thrombocytopenia)



A low level of red blood cells (anemia)



Current fever or infection



Recent surgery



Swelling (lymphedema)





Physical limits due to tumors or other
health problems
A high risk of falling or other safety issues

If you are done with treatment, your doctor will
also consider possible late effects, such as
heart and blood vessel problems.

Any new exercise program should be designed
according to your age, type of cancer, and
physical fitness level. The program should
be adjusted as your cancer status and your
overall health change. Your doctor may
suggest a cancer-specific exercise program, if
available.
There are 2 main components to most
exercise programs. Cardiovascular endurance
(“cardio”) is one focus. These activities—like
walking, jogging, and swimming—get your
heart pumping and your blood moving. This
improves heart and blood vessel health.

Yoga

Cognitive behavioral therapy

Yoga involves exercise, meditation (focusing
thoughts), and control of breathing and
emotions. These practices are thought to help
balance the body and mind. Yoga has been
found to reduce fatigue, improve sleep quality,
and lessen anxiety and depression in people
with cancer.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a
method of influencing thoughts in order to
promote changes in behavior. CBT is provided
by a mental health professional, often a
behavioral therapist.
Anyone can develop unhealthy or inaccurate
thought patterns. And It can be hard to look at
your own thoughts objectively. A form of CBT
called cognitive restructuring helps you notice
stress-producing or other negative thoughts
as they occur. Once you notice them, you can
take steps to change or reframe them.

There are many different styles of yoga.
Some are gentle while others are vigorous.
Yoga should be practiced under the guidance
of a well-trained instructor. Before starting,
talk to your care team about whether yoga is
appropriate for you, and which type(s) might
be best.

Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention
in the current moment. Stress reduction
programs that focus on being mindful can
teach you how to deal with daily stressors.

Yoga
There is good evidence
that yoga reduces fatigue,
especially when practiced
on a regular basis. Yoga
is recommended for the
treatment of cancer-related
fatigue during and after
cancer treatment.

Supportive expressive therapies

Acupuncture

These practices and therapies help you
express your emotions, connect with others,
and build a support system. Doing so may
lower stress and improve fatigue.

In acupuncture, a licensed or certified provider
inserts thin needles through the skin at
specific points on your body. You may have
mild discomfort or tingling when some of
the needles are inserted. Other needles you
may not feel at all. Acupuncture should not
be painful. It is common to feel very relaxed
afterwards.

Many people with cancer find support groups
to be helpful. There are often both inperson and online options. If your hospital or
community doesn’t have support groups for
people with cancer, check out the websites
listed in this book.

Acupuncture can help relieve pain and lessen
fatigue. While it is generally safe, acupuncture
may not be recommended–or may need to be
tailored–for those with certain health issues,
such as a high risk of bleeding or infection. Ask
your care team if acupuncture is safe for you.

Speaking with a licensed therapist or
counselor may also be helpful. In addition to
emotional support, these professionals can
provide practical advice and strategies for
coping with fatigue.
Journaling is another type of supportive
expression. Writing down your thoughts and
feelings can help reduce stress and anxiety.
Many people with cancer find that journaling
gives them a sense of control over their
experience. Recording your thoughts on paper
or electronically doesn’t have to take long.
Even just 5 or 10 minutes a day is helpful.

Massage therapy

CBT for insomnia

Massage therapy is a treatment in which the
soft tissues of the body are kneaded, rubbed,
and stroked. It can help relieve stress, pain,
and cancer-related fatigue. Other health
benefits may include lowered blood pressure
and improved circulation.

People suffering from insomnia cannot fall
asleep, stay asleep, or get restful sleep. CBT
for insomnia (CBT-I) is a structured program
that can improve sleep quality and lessen
fatigue.
There are different forms of CBT for insomnia.
Limiting the activities that you do in bed to only
sleeping and sex is called stimulus control.
Sleep restriction involves limiting your time in
bed to the time you are actually sleeping.

Before booking with a massage therapist,
confirm that they are familiar with cancer
massage. There are health risks to having a
massage from a provider that is not trained in
cancer-specific needs.

Sleep hygiene is a set of healthy sleep habits.
These habits can help you fall and stay asleep.
They include setting regular sleep patterns,
optimizing your sleep environment, and being
physically active early in the day.

Massage therapy
There is good evidence
that massage reduces
fatigue. Massage is
recommended for the
treatment of cancerrelated fatigue during and
after treatment.

Bright white light therapy
Bright white light therapy (BWLT) involves
being close to very high fluorescent light. The
light comes from a box or device designed for
use at home. The light stimulates the part of
the brain that regulates circadian cycles.

Choosing a Complementary
Health Practitioner

More research is needed on this treatment
approach. For example, we do not know
the best time of day to do bright white light
therapy, or how long each session should last.

It is important to do your research when
looking for a complementary health
provider, such as an acupuncturist,
massage therapist, or homeopathic
practitioner.

Nutrition check-up

For tips on choosing a provider that meets
your needs, see the following website:

Cancer treatment often causes nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores, changes in
taste, and loss of appetite. Many people end
up eating and drinking less overall as a result.

https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/tips/thingsto-know-when-selecting-a-complementaryhealth-practitioner

Speaking with a nutritionist or registered
dietitian may be helpful. These experts can
help guide your eating and drinking based on
your health and circumstances.

Medications
If all other causes of your fatigue have been
treated or ruled out, your provider may speak
with you about medications that could be
considered. This will depend on your goals and
circumstances.

Treatment for cancer-related fatigue » At the end of life

At the end of life

In addition, the health problems listed below
are more common in those at the end of life.
All of these conditions can cause or worsen
cancer-related fatigue.

Cancer-related fatigue is common at the end of
life. It often occurs with other symptoms such
as pain and trouble breathing. While cancerrelated fatigue typically worsens as the cancer
worsens, symptoms are different for everyone.
While some people are tired all the time, for
others it is unpredictable and may come on
suddenly.

Anemia



Medication side effects and interactions



As cancer-related fatigue worsens, the more
likely it is to disrupt daily life and cause
emotional distress. If you are a caregiver,
this is good to know so that you can plan
accordingly.

Trouble thinking clearly due to cognitive
impairment, delirium, or other problems



Side effects of recent treatment



Poor nutrition

Managing cancer-related fatigue, pain, and
other symptoms is a major focus of care for
those at the end of life. If you or someone you
care for is suffering from advanced cancer, ask
your care team for information on managing
fatigue and other symptoms.

For those with advanced
cancer, fatigue may
worsen at the end of life.
Many choose to focus
on spending time with
loved ones, doing things
that do not require a lot
of energy. If it aligns with
your goals, being active
is encouraged when
possible.

Treatment for cancer-related fatigue » At the end of life

Physical activity

Medications

Although cancer-related fatigue may be worst
at the end of life, some people choose to
be active. Research suggests that physical
activity can improve fatigue in those with
incurable cancer at the end of life, including
those in hospice care.

If all other causes of your fatigue have been
treated or ruled out, your provider may speak
with you about medications that could be
considered. This will depend on your goals and
circumstances.
Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and
dexamethasone, may provide short-term relief
for fatigue. Because they are not safe to use
long-term, corticosteroids are usually only
given to those at the end of life, or to those
with side effects from brain or bone tumors.

If it aligns with your goals, being more active
is encouraged when possible. Your doctor will
speak with you about safely increasing your
activity level.
Your overall health plays a key role in deciding
what you can do safely. If you have any of the
following, the plan should be customized:



Bone tumors
An increased risk of bruising or bleeding
due to a low level of platelets



A low level of red blood cells (anemia)



Fever or active infection



Physical limits due to tumors or other
health problems

Your safety is a key factor that your health care
provider will consider. Those at the end of life
may be more likely to fall or get other injuries.
