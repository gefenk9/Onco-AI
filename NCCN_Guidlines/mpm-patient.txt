Mesothelioma basics

What is mesothelioma?

Being diagnosed with cancer can be
frightening and overwhelming. This
guidebook will help you make sense
of all the information that’s out there.
It will also describe your options for
treatment. Taken together, you’ll have
the confidence to make well-informed
decisions.

What is mesothelioma?
Malignant pleural mesothelioma—often
simply called mesothelioma—is a rare cancer
that develops in the thin layers of tissue that
surround the lungs.
The term malignant pleural mesothelioma
requires more explanation, though. Let’s break
it down, from last word to first, to figure out
exactly what it means:

The pleura
The pleura is made of two layers
of mesothelium tissue. The inner
layer (the visceral pleura) covers
the lungs. The outer layer (the
parietal pleura) lines the inside
of the chest wall. In between the
two layers is a narrow space
called the pleural cavity or
pleural space.

Mesothelioma – A mesothelioma is a
cancer of the cells in a layer of tissue
called the mesothelium. The mesothelium
is a thin but strong membrane that lines
many organs inside the body. Its main
job is to protect the organs but also allow
the organs to move when needed. The
mesothelium has different names when it
covers different organs. Around the lungs,
it’s called the pleural mesothelium.



Pleural – This word refers to the pleura.
The pleura is made of mesothelium and
connective tissue. The pleura consists of
two thin layers that surround and protect
the lungs and the inside of the chest. One
pleural layer covers the lungs (visceral
pleura) and the other pleural layer lines
the inside of the chest cavity (parietal
pleura). In between the pleural layers is a
very thin space called the pleural cavity.
This narrow space is filled with a slippery
liquid called pleural fluid. This fluid lets the

1

pleural layers slide easily against one
another. This sliding ability allows the
lungs to move freely within the chest
during breathing.


Malignant – Malignant describes a
medical condition that is dangerous
and possibly fatal if left untreated.
Cancer cells are malignant when they
multiply and spread out of control.

Now, let’s put it all together:
Malignant pleural mesothelioma is
a dangerous and potentially deadly
cancer that develops from cells in the
lining of the lungs.

What is cancer?
Cancer is a disease where cells—the building
blocks of the body—grow out of control. This
can end up harming the body. There are
many types of cells in the body, so there are
many types of cancers.
Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells.
Normal cells have certain rules. Cancer cells
don’t follow these rules.
•

Cancer cells develop genetic errors
(mutations) that allow them to multiply and
make many more cancer cells. The cancer
cells crowd out and overpower normal
cells. Cancer cells take away energy and
nutrients that normal cells need.

•

Normal cells live for a while and then die.
Cancer cells avoid normal cell death. They
survive much longer than normal cells do.

•

Cancer cells can spread to other areas of
the body. They can replace many normal
cells and cause organs to stop working
well.

•

Treatment may get rid of cancer at first but
sometimes the cancer comes back later.

•

Cancer can stop responding to treatment
that worked before.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma is the
most common type of mesothelioma. It
accounts for about 85% of all cases of
mesothelioma.
But there are other areas of mesothelium
in the body, so there are other types
of mesothelioma. Other types of
mesothelioma include cancer of the lining
of the abdomen (peritoneal mesothelioma)
and cancer of the lining around the
heart (pericardial mesothelioma). These
mesotheliomas are even more rare than
pleural mesothelioma.
This book discusses only malignant pleural
mesothelioma. From this point on, we’ll
refer to malignant pleural mesothelioma
simply as mesothelioma.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, 2022

Scientists have learned a great deal about
cancer. As a result, today’s treatments work
better than treatments in the past. Also, many
people with cancer have more treatment
choices now than before.

has been widely used in construction and
commercial materials such as insulation,
roofing, brake pads, and more.

Asbestos is the main cause of mesothelioma.
Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring
minerals. It’s found in rocks and soil in many
parts of the United States and around the
world.

But asbestos is also harmful. Asbestos
can break into tiny pieces that can become
airborne. These particles can be inhaled or
even swallowed. When asbestos fibers are
inhaled, they can enter the lungs. In the lungs,
some of the fibers can travel to the ends of
the small airways, where they enter a space
between the pleural layers called the pleural
cavity. The long asbestos fibers sometimes get

Asbestos is made up of bundles of long, thin
fibers. These fibers are so small that they can
only be seen under a microscope. Asbestos
fibers are strong, flexible, and resistant to heat
and fire. Because of these traits, asbestos

Asbestos exposure

stuck in the pleural cavity and remain there for
years, even decades. The fibers can irritate
and injure the cells of the pleura, causing
inflammation. Many scientists think that this
process causes changes in the cells, which
result in cancer.

Most people who develop mesothelioma have
been in contact with asbestos. About 4 out of 5
people with mesothelioma have been around
or worked with asbestos. Asbestos fibers in the
body will continue to cause harm even if the
person is no longer around asbestos.

Mesothelioma develops over many years. The
average time between contact with asbestos
and being diagnosed with mesothelioma
ranges from 15 to 50 years. Mesothelioma
is often unnoticed during this in-between
period and usually remains undiagnosed
until age 75 years or older. That’s because
many mesothelioma-related problems—
like shortness of breath or having a cough
that just won’t go away—may appear to be
related to another type of illness. And serious
mesothelioma-related health effects, like chest
pain, haven’t become a big problem yet.

Workers who use, install, or remove asbestos
as part of their jobs are much more likely to
get mesothelioma than other workers. The
occurrence of mesothelioma among people
who worked with it is 40 times greater than for
people in the general workforce. Mesothelioma
occurs more often in men because they’re
more likely to work in industries that use
asbestos. Some common jobs with possible
asbestos exposure include construction,
shipbuilding, and vehicle brake repair. Women
who worked as teachers in poorly maintained

How asbestos activates mesothelioma
If you inhale asbestos fibers, they can travel through the lungs and get caught in the pleura—
the layers of tissue that surround the lungs. In the pleural cells, the asbestos fibers will irritate
the tissue and cause swelling and scarring. Over years, this irritation may trigger cancer in
the pleura, eventually causing symptoms like coughing or shortness of breath.

schools containing exposed asbestos
have also developed mesothelioma. Even
“secondary exposure,” when workers bring
home asbestos fibers on work clothes, can
expose family members or other people to
asbestos and a higher risk of mesothelioma.
In addition, some samples of talcum powder,
which was used in products like baby powder
and makeup, were found to be contaminated
with asbestos.

However, most people who are exposed
to asbestos, even a lot of it, don’t develop
mesothelioma. What’s more, about 1 in 5
people with mesothelioma have had no known
contact with asbestos. This fact suggests that
there may be other causes of mesothelioma
besides asbestos.

Facts about mesothelioma
•

Mesothelioma is a rare cancer. It’s diagnosed in about 3,000 people in the United
States each year.

•

Mesothelioma that affects the chest (malignant pleural mesothelioma) is the most
common type of mesothelioma, accounting for 85% of all cases.

•

Asbestos is the number 1 cause of mesothelioma. About 4 out of 5 people who
develop mesothelioma have been exposed to asbestos in their lifetime.

•

The average time between contact with asbestos and being diagnosed with
mesothelioma ranges from 15 to 50 years.

•

Asbestos has been completely banned from use in more than 60 countries. Though
the use of asbestos has greatly decreased in the United States, it hasn’t been officially
banned.

the lungs. However, mesothelioma sometimes
spreads from the pleura to other areas in the
chest and to other areas of the body, including
the lungs.

Symptoms of
mesothelioma

How is mesothelioma found?
Mesothelioma is usually found after a person
develops certain symptoms. A symptom is a
feeling or problem you have that can indicate
a disease or condition. Symptoms of pleural
mesothelioma may not appear until decades
after contact with asbestos. Some common
symptoms are shortness of breath, chest
pain, fever, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and
unexplained weight loss.

Shortness of breath

Chest pain

Persistent cough

Let your doctor know if you have these or other
symptoms. Your symptoms may be the first
step toward a diagnosis. A diagnosis means
identifying an illness based on tests.

High temperature (fever)
and sweating

Diagnosing mesothelioma can be a lengthy
and worrisome experience. Because
mesothelioma is so rare, it can be mistaken
for other conditions that are more common.
Some respiratory conditions, like pneumonia
or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), have many of the same symptoms as
mesothelioma.

Fatigue (extreme tiredness)

Loss of appetite and
unexplained weight loss

Mesothelioma is also difficult to distinguish
from other cancers. That’s why your doctor will
request several different tests to determine the
location, the extent, and the cell type of the
cancer you have. Knowing these facts will help
to determine your treatment.

Trouble swallowing/
hoarseness

It can take time to diagnose mesothelioma, but
it’s important to find the correct diagnosis so
you can get the right treatment.

What’s the best treatment?

What’s the best treatment for
mesothelioma?

Mesothelioma is rare
and can be difficult to
diagnose and treat.
Seek out a medical
center that specializes
in the diagnosis
and treatment of
mesothelioma.

There’s no single “best” treatment for
mesothelioma. Treatment is focused on you—
your age, your current health, how advanced
your cancer is, and other factors.
Treatment helps to destroy cancer cells
and keep cancer cells from spreading.
Treatments for mesothelioma include surgery,
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation
therapy. Mesothelioma can be difficult to treat,
so two or more of these therapies may be
required. Treatment may continue, off and on,
for the rest of your life.

symptoms and extend life. In some cases,
people with mesothelioma have survived for
many years.

Researchers are constantly investigating
more effective treatments for mesothelioma.
Treatments currently in development may work
better than those that have been available
up to now. A clinical trial of a potential new
therapy is another treatment option that people
with mesothelioma can consider.

In the past, the outlook for people with
mesothelioma wasn’t good. Even today, the
outlook can be discouraging. Most people
diagnosed with mesothelioma will have a
difficult road ahead.
Still, there’s hope. Things are changing. Better
testing is identifying mesothelioma earlier.
Newly introduced medicines are showing
greater effectiveness in treating mesothelioma.
Other promising therapies that are specifically
designed to treat mesothelioma are currently
being studied in clinical trials. The number of
these trials has increased in recent years,
offering more hope to patients.

Can mesothelioma be cured?
Mesothelioma can be cured sometimes,
though this is rare. Treatment is improving as
doctors and researchers learn more about the
disease.
When mesothelioma is caught early, treatment
options and outcomes improve. However, the
time between contact with asbestos and the
emergence of the disease can take decades.
So, mesothelioma is often at an advanced
stage when it’s diagnosed.
However, even for advanced-stage
mesothelioma, treatment can relieve

Tests for mesothelioma

Health history

Doctors use a variety of tests to
diagnose mesothelioma. Testing is
necessary to find out whether you
have cancer. If you do have cancer,
testing can show whether you have
mesothelioma or a different cancer.
Testing can also give your doctors clues
about what treatments may be most
appropriate for you.

Tips for testing
Results from blood tests, imaging studies,
and biopsies will be used to determine
your treatment plan. It’s important you
understand what these tests mean. Ask
questions and keep copies of your test
results. Online patient portals are a great
way to access your test results.

The thought of cancer is scary. Even having
tests for cancer can be scary. This chapter will
help you know what to expect during testing.
Testing will show how much cancer there is
and provide a diagnosis, which will help to plan
treatment. These steps can help put thoughts
into action, which may reduce some of the
anxiety.

Remember these tips for
testing:

There’s no single test that will show whether
you have mesothelioma. Rather, several tests
are required to reach a final diagnosis. Testing
begins with an examination of your general
health and an evaluation of your symptoms.
Bring someone with you to listen, ask
questions, and write down the answers.
Not every person with mesothelioma will
receive every test listed here.

Health history
Your doctors need to have all of your health
information. They’ll ask you about any health
problems and treatments you’ve had. Be
prepared to talk about any illness or injury
you’ve had and when it happened. Bring a list
of old and new medicines and any over-the-

•

Get copies of blood tests, imaging
results, and reports about the specific
type of cancer you have.

•

Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on
your computer.

•

Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add

Don’t put too much stock in survival statistics
You should think twice when reading about survival rates.
The numbers used to compile those statistics probably
aren’t current. It takes years to gather that information.
So the statistics you read today likely reflect survival rates
from a few years ago. In the meanwhile, new and improved
treatments have become available, giving today’s patients
better results.
And don’t forget: You’re not a statistic. Your cancer isn’t the
same as anyone else’s. Statistics based on general averages
don’t necessarily apply to individuals—including you.

activities that people do, or traits passed down
from parents to children through genes.

You’ll be asked whether you’ve been exposed
to or worked with asbestos, or whether you
lived with someone who worked with asbestos.
If no one asks you, be sure to share this
information. Sometimes a person can get
mesothelioma by being close to another
person who works with or around asbestos.
The asbestos fibers can be carried home in the
worker’s hair or clothes. This is called secondhand or secondary asbestos exposure.

Asbestos is the only known risk factor for
mesothelioma, but there might be more.
Scientists are studying other possible risk
factors, including:

Some people with mesothelioma haven’t had
any contact with asbestos that they’re aware
of. This suggests that some people may
have unknown asbestos exposure or other
risk factors. A risk factor is something that
increases the chance of getting a disease.
Risk factors can be things in the environment,



Genetic abnormality – A genetic
abnormality (mutation) is an unusual
change in the specific instructions for
making and controlling cells. Scientific
studies have shown that having a
mutation in the BAP1 gene may increase
the risk of developing mesothelioma.
Mutations in other genes—like NF2 and
CDKN2A genes—have also been linked
to mesothelioma.



Radiation therapy – Previous treatment
with radiation therapy might be a cause of
mesothelioma, but this is very rare.

2

Tests for mesothelioma



Simian virus 40 – Some researchers
believe that being infected with this virus
may increase the risk of mesothelioma in
people who’ve been exposed to asbestos.

Physical exam
Symptoms are often related to the location
of the mesothelioma as well as its size.
Mesothelioma in its early stages may cause
only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
However, mesothelioma can produce fluid
around the lung that constricts or presses on
the lung, causing shortness of breath.

Smoking is not a risk factor for mesothelioma.
(People who smoke and have been in
contact with asbestos do have an increased
risk for lung cancer, though.) People with
mesothelioma who smoke should try to quit,
because smoking may interfere with cancer
treatment. For example, smoking delays
wound healing after surgery.

Other respiratory problems—like pneumonia
or the flu—can have the same symptoms as
mesothelioma. This can cause confusion that
delays finding the real cause of the problem.
For the most accurate diagnosis, be sure to
tell your doctor about any symptoms you’re
having, even if they seem unrelated.

Symptoms

indicate a disease or condition. Possible
symptoms of mesothelioma can be found in

If you have one or more of these symptoms,
your doctor will request that you have a

Signs of asbestos-related disease



Pleural eﬀusion and pleural thickening can
develop due to asbestos exposure.


Pleural effusion – Fluid around the
lung is called pleural effusion. Pleural
eﬀusion is often the earliest sign of
asbestos-related disease. However, not
everyone who has pleural effusion will
have mesothelioma. Pleural eﬀusion is
an unusual buildup of extra fluid in the
pleural cavity. Normally, the pleural space
holds only a small amount of fluid—about
1 teaspoon. But the amount of fluid in the
pleural space can swell to more than 1
gallon in some cases of pleural effusion.
This excess fluid puts pressure on the
lungs, making it more difficult to breathe.
Other symptoms are cough and chest
pain.

If you have pleural thickening or have had
pleural effusion more than once, or have
both, then you should get checked for
mesothelioma. Certain tests are used to find

X-ray of pleural effusion
This chest x-ray shows pleural disease
affecting both lungs, with worse
disease in the patient’s left lung (seen
on the right side in this x-ray). The left
lung has extensive pleural disease and
a large pleural effusion. The right lung
has a moderate sized pleural effusion.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, 2022

Pleural thickening – Pleural thickening
is what happens when there’s widespread
scarring of the pleural tissue. Asbestos
is one cause of pleural thickening. The
asbestos fibers scratch and scrape
the pleural lining. This irritation causes
inflammation (swelling) of the pleural
tissue. Over time, the irritation and
inflammation create scar tissue. This
scar tissue can cause plaques that
harden (calcify) over time. Increased scar
tissue leads to thickening of the pleural
layers, which can restrict the movement
of the lungs. A person whose lungs
can’t fully expand can have a feeling of
breathlessness. Other symptoms are
chest pain and cough.

Fluid biopsy



Tissue biopsy

A chest x-ray is usually the first imaging
test done when someone has symptoms in
the chest. A chest x-ray may show pleural
thickening, pleural fluid (effusion), or a mass
or masses within the chest. Sometimes
it’s difficult to tell the difference between
thickening, fluid, or a mass by looking only at
an x-ray, so other imaging must be done.

Let’s discuss each of these tests in turn.

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan is
another type of imaging test. A CT machine
uses x-rays to take many images of your
body from different angles. A computer then
combines the pictures to make a 3-D image.

Imaging of the chest
If your symptoms suggest mesothelioma, your
doctor will want you to get an imaging test.
An imaging test takes pictures (images) of
the insides of your body. The images show
areas in the body that might have cancer. The
images can reveal the cancer’s location, size,
and other features.

A CT of the chest is recommended when
a chest x-ray shows something that looks
abnormal. A CT scan can show any unusual
thickening of the pleura, which can be an
indication of mesothelioma. Your doctors will
be able to see where tumors have formed and
the size of the tumors. They can also see if the

CT scan
A CT scanner is a large
machine with a tunnel in
the middle. During the
test, you’ll lie on a table
that moves slowly through
the tunnel. The machine

images that can show
evidence of cancer.

Diagnosis vs. prognosis

Your treatment team will tell you how to
prepare for an imaging scan. You may need to
stop taking some medicines and stop eating
and drinking for a few hours before the scan.
You also should remove any metal objects
on your body. You’ll likely be asked to wear a
hospital gown during the test.

What’s the difference between your
diagnosis and your prognosis? These
two words sound alike but they’re very
different.

Diagnosis means identifying an illness
based on tests. Your diagnosis names
what illness you have.

Some imaging tests use a contrast agent (also
called contrast dye). Contrast is used to make
blood vessels, organs, and other tissues stand
out more clearly in the imaging. Contrast is
injected into the bloodstream and flushed out
in urine.

Prognosis is the likely course and

outcome of a disease based on tests
and your response to treatment. Your
prognosis predicts how your illness will
turn out.

A CT scanner is a large machine that has a
tunnel in the middle. During the test, you’ll
need to lie on a table that moves slowly
through the tunnel. Pillows or straps may be
used to keep you still during the test. Tell your
team if you get nervous in small spaces. You
may be given a sedative (medicine) to help
you relax.

results to your doctor. This information helps
your doctor plan the next steps of your care.

You’ll be alone, but a technician will operate
the machine in a nearby room. The technician
will be able to see, hear, and speak with you at
all times.

Biopsy
A biopsy is a surgical procedure that removes
a small amount of fluid or tissue for testing.

As the machine takes pictures, you may hear
buzzing, clicking, or whirring sounds. A CT
scan is done in about 30 seconds, but the
entire process takes 20 to 30 minutes.

If your CT scan shows fluid or a mass
(something that looks like it might be a tumor),
your doctor will want to take a sample of the
fluid or the tissue.

After the CT scan, your images will be studied
by a radiologist. A radiologist is a doctor who’s
an expert in reading imaging tests like CT
scans. The radiologist will send the imaging

Fluid biopsy

Tissue biopsy

A pleural biopsy is when one or more samples
of pleural tissue are removed. The tissue
samples are then sent to a lab to be tested for
cancer cells.

Taking fluid out of the chest is called a
thoracentesis. Fluid from a thoracentesis is
usually sent for many different tests. Some of
the fluid is sent for chemistry testing, some
to check for infection, and some to look for
cancer cells. Thoracentesis is also a procedure
for removing excess fluid in a person with a
pleural effusion.

A pleural biopsy can be done in several ways.
Options include a thoracoscopic biopsy, a CTor ultrasound-guided core biopsy, or an open
biopsy. A thoracoscopic biopsy is the preferred
method because it can obtain enough tissue
for an accurate diagnosis. However, it may not
be the right option for every patient.

For thoracentesis, your skin will be cleaned
and numbed with a local anesthetic. Next, a
needle will be inserted between your ribs into
your chest to get the fluid. You may be given
an x-ray before and after the biopsy. This is
done to help the doctor guide the needle into
your chest and afterward to check if the biopsy
went well.



The fluid sample will then be sent to a lab to
be tested for the presence of cancer cells and
other tests.

Fluid biopsy
Thoracentesis is a procedure for
removing excess fluid in the pleural
cavity (pleural effusion). A sample of
the fluid removed from the pleural
cavity can be used for a fluid biopsy.

Thoracoscopic biopsy – For a
thoracoscopic biopsy—also called videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)—a
small hole is cut into the chest. Next,
an instrument called a thoracoscope is
inserted through the hole. A thoracoscope
has a tiny light, a video camera, and
a tool to remove a tissue sample. The
surgeon watches the video monitor to

Before the surgery, general anesthesia is

tell the pathologist whether your sample
is malignant (cancerous) or benign (not
cancerous).

CT-guided or ultrasound-guided core
biopsy – A CT-guided or ultrasoundguided core biopsy uses images from a
CT scan or ultrasound device to guide
a needle into your body. First, your skin
will be cleaned and numbed with a local
anesthetic. Next, the needle will be
inserted through a small cut and guided
into your chest between your ribs. Then,
the sample will be removed by the sharp
end of the needle and held in a hollow
space within the needle.

If it’s malignant, the pathologist can also
get an idea of how aggressive your cancer
is by looking at the cells. Cancer cells that
look almost like normal cells indicate that the
cancer cells are growing and spreading slowly.
Cancer cells that look very different from
normal cells suggest that the cells are growing
and spreading quickly.
Histology can be used to predict the outlook
(prognosis) of the cancer and plan treatment.

Open biopsy – An open biopsy requires
a surgical opening into the chest. It’s
performed while you’re under general
anesthesia. The larger cut of the opening
allows the surgeon to see directly into
your chest. Tissue samples are collected
with a surgical knife. For this biopsy, you’ll
have to stay in the hospital overnight.

Immunohistochemistry

The pathologist can identify the type of cancer
cell with another laboratory method called
immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry
is used to find specific proteins linked with
only a certain type of cell. Pathologists use
immunohistochemistry to tell the difference
between mesothelioma cells and cells of
similar-looking cancers.

What happens when a biopsy sample is
sent to a lab? At the lab, a specialist called a
pathologist will examine the sample under a
microscope. Pathologists are doctors who are
experts at examining cells and tissue to find
disease.

To identify mesothelioma, the cells should
have certain proteins and also be without other
particular proteins. Proteins that help confirm
mesothelioma have names such as BAP1,
MTAP, WT1, D2-40, and calretinin. Proteins
that help rule out (exclude) other cancers are
claudin-4, TTF-1, napsin A, and polyclonal
CEA.

For mesothelioma, the main types of tests
include histology, immunohistochemistry, and
genetic testing.

Immunohistochemistry is also used to identify
different mesothelioma cell subtypes. Your
mesothelioma subtype may be used to guide
your treatment. The three major subtypes of
mesothelioma cells are described in Guide 2.

Histology

The pathologist will use a microscope to
look at cells in your biopsy sample. This is
called histology—the study of cell and tissue
structures viewed under a microscope. The
size, shape, and structure of the cells can

Genetic testing

Genetic testing looks for abnormal changes
in the genes of cells. Genes carry DNA—the
“instructions” for making new cells and for
controlling how cells behave. An abnormal
change in a gene can disrupt how some cells
behave, which can cause diseases like cancer.

Your pathology report
Lab results used for diagnosis are put
into a pathology report. This report
will be sent to your doctor. It’s used
to plan your treatment. A meeting
among all your doctors may be
helpful for treatment planning once
the pathology report is finished.

Then again, an abnormal genetic change may
not necessarily cause mesothelioma but may
make a person more vulnerable to asbestosrelated disease.
How does a genetic abnormality lead to
mesothelioma? Let’s look at the BAP1 gene,
for example. BAP1 is known as a tumorsuppressing gene. Its job is to prevent
mesothelioma tumors from growing. But if
BAP1 has or develops an abnormal genetic

Mesothelioma cell subtypes
Cell subtypes

Cell subtype details

Prognosis

Epithelioid

Epithelioid cells are uniform and
arranged in organized patterns. This is
the most common mesothelioma cell
subtype.

Treatment for the epithelioid subtype
tends to be more effective. People
with this subtype may have a better
prognosis.

Sarcomatoid

Sarcomatoid cells are rod-shaped
and found in disorganized patterns.
Sarcomatoid is the least common cell
subtype.

Treatment tends to be less effective
for the sarcomatoid subtype. People
with this subtype may have a poorer
prognosis.

Biphasic (mixed)

The biphasic subtype has a mix of
both epithelioid and sarcomatoid
cells. It’s the second most common
mesothelioma cell type.

Prognosis for people with the
biphasic subtype depends on
the proportion of epithelial cells
compared to sarcomatoid cells.

change that affects its job, the gene will no
longer be able to stop mesothelioma.

When someone is given a diagnosis of cancer,
they can feel overwhelmed and frightened.
Many people want to have treatment right
away. Others may blame themselves for
getting mesothelioma. The important thing to
do is to make sure you’re getting the best care.

In addition to BAP1, several other genes are
known to develop abnormal changes that may
lead to mesothelioma. These include NF2,
CDKN2A, TP53, and other genes.
What causes an abnormal genetic change?
Sometimes an abnormal change is hereditary,
which means it’s passed from a parent to a
child. Other times, the genetic abnormality
occurs all by itself. Both kinds of genetic
alterations occur in mesothelioma, though the
hereditary kind occurs much less often.

Ask for a second opinion

A second opinion means asking another
doctor to look at your test results and come
up with a treatment plan. With a rare cancer
like mesothelioma, it’s very common to get a
second opinion. Doctors understand this. Your
doctor may even suggest the idea of a second
opinion. Ask for a second opinion at a center
that sees many patients with mesothelioma.
(For more about second opinions, see Chapter
7.)

Genetic testing is becoming increasingly
important in cancers like mesothelioma. One
reason is that it can lead to a more precise
prognosis. Another reason is that researchers
are learning to match genetic abnormalities
with specific treatments, which are resulting in
better outcomes.

If your biopsy and other test results show
that you do have mesothelioma, you may
need even more tests before you can start
treatment. First, your doctor will want to know
how much cancer you have and how far it
has spread within your body. (This is called
staging, explained further in Chapter 3.)
Knowing the extent of the cancer will help your
team determine the best treatment for you.

Reviewing your test results
It may take several days after any test to
receive the results. Your cancer doctor or your
lung specialist will review the test results with
you.
Lab tests don’t always provide a clear-cut
diagnosis, especially with a hard-to-identify
cancer like mesothelioma. When this happens,
you may need to have more tests or another
biopsy before a reliable diagnosis can be
made.
Your doctors will need to confirm your
diagnosis before making a treatment plan.

How widespread is the cancer?

After diagnosis, the next phase of care
is determining the extent of the cancer.
Before treatment starts, you’ll need to
have more tests to see if the cancer is
limited or more advanced. This will help
find the right therapies for you.

mesothelioma involves the pleura and nearby
areas as well as organs and tissues farther
away, it’s considered to be advanced—it’s at a
higher stage.

How does cancer spread?

Mesothelioma can spread to nearby organs
and tissues as well as those that are farther
away through metastasis. Metastasis means
the spread of cancer to a different body part
from where the cancer started. Mesothelioma
most commonly spreads by growing and
invading other nearby organs or structures in
the chest. It can also spread to nearby lymph
nodes in the chest.

How widespread is the cancer?
Before your team can prepare a treatment
plan, they’ll need to know how far the
mesothelioma has grown and spread in your
body. This is called cancer staging.

Occasionally, cancer cells use the bloodstream
or the lymphatic system like a highway to
travel to distant areas in the body. Once there,
they can invade organs and tissues and cause
other (secondary) tumors to develop. However,
metastasis to distant sites is less common with
mesothelioma than with many other cancers.

A cancer stage is a number that stands for
the extent of cancer in the body. The stages
of mesothelioma range from numbers 1 to 4.
The four cancer stages signify the extent of the
cancer and whether it has affected other body
parts. Generally, a lower number means the
cancer has grown less and a higher number
means it has grown more. The stage of cancer
is based on the results of your biopsy and
imaging.

What is the lymphatic system?

The lymphatic system is a network of
organs and vessels that fights infections and
transports a fluid called lymph throughout
the body. A key part of the lymphatic system
are lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small,
disease-fighting clusters that filter the lymph
fluid to remove germs. Mesothelioma that has
metastasized to the lymph nodes may indicate
more advanced disease.

CT of the chest and abdomen

CT imaging is essential for staging. It can
show your doctors where the cancer is, how
big it is, and if it has spread. If you haven’t
already had a CT scan of your chest, you’ll
have one now, sometimes with a CT of your
belly area (abdomen). Contrast should be used
if possible. For more about CT scans, see
Chapter 2.

What stage is the cancer?

Staging is used to plan which treatments are
best for you. Treatment options are based on
your overall health, the type of mesothelioma,
how fast the cancer is growing, and where the
cancer is located in your body.

Generally speaking, if the CT scan shows
that the cancer is confined to the pleura or
areas close to the pleura, the cancer is less
advanced—it’s at an earlier stage. When

For simplicity’s sake, we can condense the
four stages into two:




Receiving a diagnosis of mesothelioma
can turn your life upside down. This illness
may affect you in many ways—physically,
emotionally, socially, and financially.

Early-stage mesothelioma – For
people with early-stage mesothelioma
(stages 1 to 3), surgery may be an option
to use with other treatments. To learn
about treatment options for early-stage
mesothelioma, turn to Chapter 4.

But you’re not alone.
The next step of care involves a
multidisciplinary team who will work together
with you to decide on a treatment plan.
It’s essential to build strong relationships
with the members of your team who can
assist, support, and guide you through the
management of this disease.

Advanced-stage mesothelioma –
Most people with mesothelioma are at
an advanced stage (stage 3 or 4) when
they’re diagnosed. Due to several factors,
surgery usually isn’t possible for people
with advanced mesothelioma. To learn
about treatment options for advancedstage mesothelioma, turn to Chapter 5.

A multidisciplinary team is made up of
specialists from different “disciplines” (areas
of expertise). By working and communicating
together, a multidisciplinary team brings the
best knowledge from all sides to solve a
problem.

Keep in mind that these are general
recommendations. Your treatment may be very
different from another person with the same
stage of mesothelioma.
Once your doctors know how far the
mesothelioma has grown and spread in your
body, a number of experts from different
medical fields will work as a team to create
a treatment plan for you. This is called
multidisciplinary care.

Your team may include a medical oncologist,
radiation oncologist, chest (thoracic)
surgeon, pulmonologist, primary care doctor,
psychologist, nurses, social workers, palliative
care specialists, and allied health providers.
Each member of your multidisciplinary team
should have experience with mesothelioma, if
possible.
After determining the extent of the cancer, your
team’s main goal is to develop a treatment
plan. A treatment plan is a written course of
action that covers every stage of the treatment
process. The plan will be based on the extent
of cancer in your body and your other health
needs, as well as your personal choices. A
treatment plan for mesothelioma often involves
two or more different types of therapy.

Multidisciplinary care

Who’s on your treatment team?
Treating mesothelioma is a team effort. Your team
of doctors, specialists, and nurses will work together
to provide you with the best available care. You may
not need every person listed below, but it’s helpful to
understand the role that each team member plays.
Diagnostic imaging specialist – A health care
professional who performs imaging exams such
as x-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.
Chest (thoracic) surgeon – A doctor who operates on organs and structures
inside the chest.
Medical oncologist – A doctor who treats cancer using chemotherapy and other
drugs.
Radiation oncologist – A doctor who treats cancer using radiation therapy.
Pulmonologist – A doctor who specializes in diseases of the respiratory system.
Oncology nurse – A specialized nurse who works only with cancer patients.
Oncology nurses help coordinate care and administer treatment.
Palliative care specialist – A physician or other health provider focused on
improving the patient’s quality of life.
Ask who will coordinate your care and what eﬀorts can be made to schedule appointments
together.
Tip: Keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your care
team. Make copies of your list and take them with you to appointments. When
someone at a doctor’s office asks you which other doctors and specialists you’re
seeing, simply hand them a copy. (While you’re at it, make a similar list of all your
medicines.)

Treatment for early-stage mesothelioma

Treatment options for mesothelioma
vary depending on your overall health,
the type of cancer, the stage of the
cancer, and other factors. Your care
team will work with you to figure out the
best treatments for you.

This chapter explains early-stage treatment. To
read about advanced-stage treatment, turn to
Chapter 5.
If you have an earlier stage of mesothelioma
(stages 1 to 3) as well as the epithelioid
subtype, surgery may be a good option to
remove the tumor. Having good health and
being relatively younger (below age 65) also
improves the likelihood of surgery as an
option.

Multiple therapies
There are many ways to try to treat
mesothelioma, but there’s no one-size-fitsall therapy. Mesothelioma treatment often
involves multiple therapies. Options include
surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
radiation therapy, or a combination of these.

If surgery can’t remove most of the tumor,
or you choose not to have surgery, then you
may receive treatment with chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, radiation, or a combination of
these.

Treatment isn’t focused only on reducing or
destroying the cancer. There are also therapies
for reducing mesothelioma symptoms and for
the side effects of treatment itself.

If your doctors think the cancer can be
removed by surgery, then you’ll have more
tests. To learn about these tests, see Guide 3.
These tests are done for a few reasons:

Different treatments are recommended
for diﬀerent stages and subtypes of
mesothelioma.
For people with early-stage mesothelioma,
treatment may begin with surgery to
remove most or all of the tumor, followed by
chemotherapy combined with other therapies
to catch any cancer cells that surgery left
behind. Or, your doctors may recommend
chemotherapy first, before surgery. Both
options are reasonable.

Surgery
The goal of mesothelioma surgery is to
remove every part of the tumor that can be
found. Surgery alone is not considered a cure
because some microscopic cancer cells will
always be left behind. However, when surgery
is combined with systemic therapy or radiation
therapy, cure can be achieved in some
patients.

For people with advanced-stage
mesothelioma, treatment often begins with
chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

Recommended tests before surgery
Pulmonary function tests

Pulmonary function tests show how well your lungs are working.
These include tests to measure how fast you can exhale air from your
lungs, how much air your lungs can hold, how well oxygen gets into
your blood, and more.

Perfusion scanning, if
needed

Perfusion scanning shows the blood flow in and out of your lungs. You
may have this test if your pulmonary function tests suggest your lungs
aren’t working well.

PET/CT scan

A PET/CT scan uses two imaging tests together: computed
tomography (CT) and PET (positron emission tomography). PET/CT
scanning helps find mesothelioma that has spread to lymph nodes or
other organs.

Mediastinoscopy

A mediastinoscopy is a surgical biopsy of the lymph nodes in the
area in between the lungs. This space is called the mediastinum. A
viewscope is inserted through a small surgical cut just above your
breastbone and guided down to the mediastinum. Looking through
the viewscope, the surgeon uses a long tool to remove lymph node
samples for biopsy.

Endobronchial fineneedle aspiration

An endobronchial fine-needle aspiration is another way to perform
a biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes. But it doesn’t require any
surgery. A viewscope attached to an ultrasound device is guided down
your throat into your lungs. The device has a very thin needle that
extends into the mediastinum to take the biopsy sample.

Cardiac stress test

This test measures how well your heart works during exercise. Some
heart problems are easier to find when your heart is working hard.

Performance status

Performance status is an evaluation of your overall health and your
ability to do day-to-day activities. Doctors measure performance status
to get a sense of the degree of treatment you may be able to handle.

Chest MRI, if needed

MRI is an imaging test that uses radio waves and powerful magnets.
An MRI scan of your chest is another way to see if the cancer has
spread to your chest wall, spine, diaphragm, or blood vessels. This
information can help guide surgery to remove mesothelioma tumors.

VATS or laparoscopy, if
needed

These two types of surgeries are used to get a better look inside your
chest. One or both of these tests are used if imaging scans show that
mesothelioma has affected the pleuras of both lungs or the lining of
the belly area (abdomen).

Treatment for early-stage mesothelioma

Surgery should be performed by a
thoracic surgeon who has experience with
mesothelioma. A thoracic surgeon is an expert
at operating on organs inside the chest.

Before you start any
treatment, let your
doctors know what
medicines you’re taking,
including vitamins, overthe-counter supplements,
or complementary
therapies. These might
have an effect on your
treatment.

There are two types of surgery for
mesothelioma:


Pleurectomy/decortication (P/D)
removes the tumor and the pleura
without removing the lung. Sometimes
the pericardium (the lining around the
heart) and part of the diaphragm are also
removed.



Extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP)
removes both pleural layers and the lung.
This procedure may also remove part of
the diaphragm and often the pericardium.

talk to you about how the risks compare to the
benefits in your particular case.

Your doctors will consider a number of factors
before recommending which operation is best
for you. These factors include your overall
health, performance status, symptoms,
cancer stage, and the cell subtype of the
mesothelioma.

In either surgery, you’ll have to stay in the
hospital for the operation. You’ll be given
general anesthesia, which means you’ll be
asleep and feel no pain during the surgery.
You’ll be positioned on your side on the
operating table. The surgeon will make a cut
into the side of your chest. Your ribs will be
spread or one rib will be partly removed to
make an opening wide enough to take out
the pleura, pieces of tumor, lung, or other
necessary tissues.

Sometimes, the surgeon will have to begin
operating first to see what’s going on inside
your chest before deciding which surgery is the
most appropriate one for you.
If the surgeon looks inside your chest and
decides that no surgery is the right option, you
may still have treatment with chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, or radiation therapy (or
a combination) after you recover from the
operation.

The surgeon will also take samples of
the lymph nodes in between your lungs
(mediastinum). This is done to find out if the
cancer has spread to the lymphatic system.
You’ll be given time to recover after the
surgery. However, you’ll likely have other
therapies after surgery. Chemotherapy may be
given either before or after surgery.

Surgery has risks and benefits. EPP is more
aggressive than P/D at removing tumor
tissues. However, P/D is less invasive and has
fewer risks of complications. Your doctors will

unexpected result of an operation. Every
surgery has risks of complications. Let

left behind after the procedure. Chemotherapy
is also given by itself without surgery.

How is it given?

Chemotherapy treatment for mesothelioma
usually involves a mix of liquid drugs, which
are given intravenously. This means they’re
injected slowly into a vein in your arm or
another part of your body (IV infusion). The
drugs travel in the bloodstream to reach
cancer cells throughout the body.
You’ll sit in a chair or bed at the hospital
or clinic while receiving the medicine or
medicines. A treatment session can last from
a few minutes to a few hours. A chemotherapy
treatment session for mesothelioma usually
involves an infusion of one medicine followed
by an infusion of another medicine.

These could be signs of a complication.
Surgical complications can be successfully
treated, especially if caught early.

Systemic therapy

How often will I have it?

Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment
days. One cycle may include treatment
given once a week or once every few weeks,
followed by days or weeks of rest. This rest
period allows the body to recover before the
next treatment cycle. Cycles vary in length
depending on which drugs are used.

A treatment that affects the whole body is
called systemic therapy. Systemic drugs for
cancer travel throughout the body to find tumor
cells. The main systemic therapy for cancer is
chemotherapy (“chemo”).
Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer
cells. Chemotherapy damages rapidly dividing
cells throughout the body. Because cancer
cells divide and multiply rapidly, they’re a
good target for chemotherapy. Chemotherapy
can harm healthy cells, too. That’s why
chemotherapy can cause side effects.

What drug is it?

For mesothelioma, the preferred systemic
therapy is a combination of pemetrexed and
cisplatin.
Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy drug that helps
prevent cancer cells from growing. It’s also
used to treat people with lung cancer. Cisplatin
is a chemotherapy drug that contains platinum.
Platinum-based chemotherapy drugs help stop
cancer cells from multiplying. (If cisplatin might

You may receive chemotherapy either before
or after surgery, or by itself. Chemotherapy is
done before surgery to shrink the tumor, which
makes it easier to remove the tumor during
surgery. Chemotherapy given after surgery is
meant to “clean up” any cancer cells that were

for mesothelioma are nivolumab (Opdivo) and
ipilimumab (Yervoy).

As noted previously, people with early-stage
mesothelioma may be given chemotherapy
either before or after surgery. However, if
surgery can’t remove the tumor or if you
choose not to have surgery, then you’d
receive first-line treatment with chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, radiation therapy, or a
combination of therapies.

Your medical oncologist will discuss your
treatment options with you.

What are the side effects?

A side eﬀect is an unpleasant or harmful
physical or emotional response to treatment.
The side effects of chemotherapy depend on
many factors. These include the drug, the
dose, the length of treatment, and the person.
Some people have many side effects. Others
have few.

If you’re not having surgery, the systemic
regimen may include chemotherapy drugs
(pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin) plus
a targeted therapy drug. A targeted therapy
drug identifies and attacks a specific feature
of cancer cells with less harm to normal
cells. The targeted therapy drug used for
mesothelioma is bevacizumab (Avastin).

Some side effects can be very serious.
Many side effects aren’t serious but are still
unpleasant. Side effects often appear shortly
after treatment starts and stop in the days
or weeks after treatment is over. Other side
effects are long-term or may even appear
years later.

Another systemic regimen is a combination
of immunotherapy drugs. Immunotherapy
drugs help a patient’s own immune system
fight the cancer. Immunotherapy drugs used

local or regional therapy because it affects only
the part of the body that’s irradiated.
For people with early-stage mesothelioma
(stages 1 to 3), radiation therapy can be used
on its own or used with chemotherapy. When
radiation therapy is used with chemotherapy,
the treatments may be given one after another
or sometimes at the same time.

Not all side effects of chemotherapy are listed
here. And not everyone will experience all of
these side effects. Ask your treatment team
for a complete list of common and rare side
effects. Tell your treatment team about any
side effect you have. There are often ways to
help you feel better. There are also ways to
prevent side effects.

Radiation therapy is sometimes given on its
own simply to reduce pain or other symptoms.
Your treatment team will decide the best time
for you to have radiation therapy. To plan
your radiation treatment, you’ll first have a CT
scan in the treatment position. This is called a
simulation. Your radiation plan will be tailored
to your individual needs.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to
treat cancer. The rays damage a cell’s DNA
(its instructions for making and controlling
cells). This damage either kills the cancer cells
or stops new cancer cells from being made.
Unlike a systemic therapy that affects the
whole body, radiation therapy is considered a

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, 2022

How is it given?

For radiation treatment, you’ll lie on a table
in the same position as you were during the
simulation. Immobilization devices may be
used to keep you from moving so that the
radiation targets the exact tumor location.

to 6 weeks. One treatment session can take
about 15 to 30 minutes. Most of this time is
spent getting you into position, with only a few
minutes of actual radiation time.
Radiation can harm normal cells as well as
cancer cells. Your radiation oncologist will use
technology to reduce the radiation applied to
the normal tissues surrounding the tumor.

A large machine will move around you as it
delivers the radiation. The radiation beams
will be aimed at the location of the tumor. The
radiation oncologist will use your imaging to
help guide the process.

What are the side effects?

Radiation can cause side eﬀects if it harms
normal cells. Side effects may include:

As treatment is given, you may hear noises
from the machine. You won’t see, hear, or feel
the radiation. It passes through your skin and
other tissues to reach the cancer cells.

How often will I have it?

The total dose of radiation is spread out over a
number of treatments (fractions). The number
of treatments varies among people with
mesothelioma. Treatments are usually given
once a day, up to 5 days a week, for about 4

Clinical trial



Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.



Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Clinical trial
Another avenue of treatment is a clinical trial. A
clinical trial is a type of medical research study.
After being tested in a laboratory, potential
new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied
in people. If found to be safe and effective
in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment
approach may be approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).

Who can enroll?

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in certain ways
in order to compare how they respond to a
specific treatment.

Participating in a clinical trial isn’t a “lastditch” effort. A clinical trial can be a firstline treatment option for many people with
mesothelioma. Clinical trials give people
access to options that they couldn’t usually
receive otherwise. Everyone with cancer
should carefully consider all of the treatment
options available for their cancer type,
including standard treatments and clinical
trials.

Informed consent

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it.

NCCN recommends that people with
mesothelioma consider a clinical trial as
their first-line therapy, if available. Talk to
your doctors about whether a clinical trial is
recommended for you.

Take time to discuss this with family, friends, or
other people you trust. Keep in mind that you
can leave and seek treatment outside of the
clinical trial at any time without penalties.

Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

Start the conversation

Phase I trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of a drug or treatment
approach. They also look for early signs
that the drug or approach is helpful.

have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. Depending on the trial,
you may continue to receive standard therapy
in addition to any experimental therapy. The

Treatment for advanced-stage mesothelioma Performance status

Most people with mesothelioma are
at an advanced stage (stage 3 or 4)
when they’re diagnosed. People with
advanced-stage mesothelioma have
fewer treatment options than people
with early-stage mesothelioma.

Consider quality of life
Quality of life is a term used often in
cancer care. It refers to a person’s
overall enjoyment of life, including
their sense of well-being and ability
to participate in regular activities. In
certain cases, aggressive cancer
treatment may extend a person’s life but
reduce their quality of life. That’s one
example why quality of life should be an
important consideration when making
decisions about cancer treatment.

Though there are fewer treatment options for
advanced-stage mesothelioma, treatment may
still prolong and improve life. Treatment for
advanced-stage mesothelioma depends a lot
on performance status.

Performance status
Performance status is a measure of overall
health and the ability to do ordinary activities.
It represents how well a person can endure a
demanding therapy. For people with advancedstage mesothelioma, performance status is a
main factor that determines their next steps:


Good performance status. People with
good or very good performance status
will either take a watch-and-wait strategy
(called observation) or be treated with
systemic therapy.



Poor performance status. People
with poor or very poor performance
status may not benefit from surgery or
other treatment and may do better with
supportive care. Supportive care is given
to ease pain or discomfort. For more
about supportive care, see Chapter 6.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, 2022

Observation
Observation is a watch-and-wait strategy.
Because mesothelioma takes decades to
develop, it may continue to grow very slowly
after it has been found and won’t need
treatment right away in some people. This
means you’ll see your doctor often during
this time but you won’t receive any treatment
unless you begin to have symptoms or until
imaging, like a CT scan, shows that your
mesothelioma is growing.
Observation works best for people with
epithelioid mesothelioma who don’t have
symptoms and who have very little evidence
of cancer on their CT scans. Discuss the risks
and potential benefits of this approach with
your oncologist.

Treatment for advanced-stage mesothelioma Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

How is immunotherapy given?

Nivolumab and ipilimumab are given
intravenously. This means they’re injected
slowly into a vein in your arm or another part of
your body (IV infusion).

Systemic therapy is treatment that affects
the whole body. As mentioned previously,
systemic therapy may be an option for
people with advanced-stage mesothelioma.
In these cases, the preferred systemic
therapy is chemotherapy or a combination of
immunotherapy drugs: nivolumab (Opdivo)
and ipilimumab (Yervoy). This is called first-line
therapy because it’s the first treatment given.

How often will I have immunotherapy?

You’ll receive nivolumab once every 3 weeks
and ipilimumab once every 6 weeks.

What are the side effects?

Immunotherapy

A side eﬀect is an unpleasant or harmful
physical or emotional response to treatment.
The side effects of immunotherapy depend on
factors like the drug, the dose, the length of

many side effects. Others have few.

What do immunotherapy drugs do?

Immunotherapy destroys cancer cells by
using your own immune system. The immune
system is your body’s natural defense against
infection and disease. Immunotherapy drugs
improve your body’s ability to find and attack
cancer cells.

Some side effects can be very serious. Most
aren’t serious but are still unpleasant. Side
effects often appear shortly after treatment

Immunotherapy takes
advantage of the body’s own

therapy) on page 36.

Supportive care is treatment given to relieve
symptoms of cancer, side eﬀects of cancer
treatment, and other related health issues.
It’s important to know that supportive care
is available at any point during cancer care,
not just at the end of life. For more about
supportive care, turn to Chapter 6.

Response to treatment
During and after treatment, your doctors
will want to know whether the treatment is
working. Has it reduced the cancer? If it has,
they’ll want to know how much, if any, cancer
is left. Doctors refer to this as “response to
treatment.”
To determine your response to treatment,
you’ll have more tests, like blood tests and CT
scans. The point of these tests is to compare
their results against the results of tests before
you started treatment. The difference between
the two rounds of testing indicates how well
you’ve responded to the treatment.
There are four basic levels of response to
treatment:


Complete response means there are no
signs or symptoms of cancer in the body.



Partial response means signs and
symptoms of cancer have decreased.



Stable disease means the cancer hasn’t
shrunk but it also hasn’t grown.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, 2022

Progressive disease means that the
cancer is still growing. Progression can
happen during therapy or after therapy.
Progression indicates that it’s time to try
another strategy, including clinical trials. If
you’ve tried all available treatments, then
supportive care may be the right strategy
for you.

Supportive care and end-of-life concerns

Supportive care is for the symptoms
and side effects of mesothelioma, and
also for psychological, social, and
spiritual issues. During this time, some
people with mesothelioma may start to
think about end-of-life concerns. Endof-life care is about improving comfort
and quality of life, not about focusing on
death.

Supportive care can also help with spiritual
support, advance care planning (which
means deciding what you would want if you
become too sick to make medical decisions for
yourself), and end-of-life concerns.
It’s important to talk openly with your treatment
team about supportive care. You know your
body better than anyone. Let your team
members know:

What is supportive care?
The main concern for most patients with
cancer is to find treatment that works. Having
cancer is not only about cancer treatment,
though. Cancer care is a rollercoaster that
includes many additional physical and
emotional challenges. It’s important to
recognize and understand that you can get
support for these challenges.

Here are some of the common challenges you
may face with mesothelioma, as well as some
of the ways supportive care can help manage
them:

Supportive care is treatment to relieve the
symptoms of mesothelioma, side eﬀects of
mesothelioma therapies, and other health
issues related to the cancer. Supportive care
also helps with psychological, social, and
spiritual issues. Supportive care involves the
whole person, not just their cancer.

Pleural eﬀusion

Pleural eﬀusion is the buildup of extra fluid in
the pleural cavity. This can result in shortness
of breath. One treatment for pleural eﬀusion is
a pleural catheter. A pleural catheter is a thin,
flexible tube that’s placed in your chest to drain
the buildup of fluid in the pleural cavity.

Supportive care is given at any stage of
disease, not just at end-of-life.

Another treatment for pleural eﬀusion is talc
pleurodesis. Talc pleurodesis involves putting
talc powder into the pleural cavity. The powder
irritates the tissue and causes the two layers
of pleura to fuse together while healing. This
seals the pleural cavity and helps to stop fluid
buildup.

Supportive care addresses many needs. It can
help with making treatment decisions. It can
also assist with coordinating care between
health providers. Notably, supportive care can
help prevent or treat physical and emotional
symptoms.

Supportive care and end-of-life concerns

Chest pain

Some chemotherapy drugs and radiation
therapy (to the upper abdomen) can cause
these unwanted side eﬀects. Your doctors
can prescribe drugs to relieve nausea and
vomiting. Other ways that might help include
eating smaller meals, drinking plenty of water,
or trying breathing exercises. Talk to your
treatment team to ask about all the ways to
help with nausea and vomiting.

Chest pain may be caused by cancer growing
into the chest wall. Radiation therapy may
be used to ease chest pain. Other ways to
manage chest pain are with pain medications
or chemotherapy.

Bronchial or esophageal obstruction

Mesothelioma can grow and cause an
obstruction (blockage). An obstruction can
block your airway or esophagus (the tube that
connects your mouth to your stomach). If you
feel you might have an obstruction, talk to your
treatment team immediately. If this happens,
radiation therapy may be used to try and shrink
the tumor.

Smoking cessation

Smoking can worsen your overall health and
how well your lungs work. If you’re a smoker,
now is the time to quit. Quitting can help
make treatment safer for you. Talk with your
treatment team about ways to quit. You can
also join a support group or talk to others who
have quit.

Nausea and vomiting

Nausea and vomiting are common cancer
side eﬀects. Nausea and vomiting can happen
from the cancer itself, health problems
caused by cancer, and from cancer treatment.

Supportive care
Supportive care—
sometimes called
palliative care—is given
at any stage of disease,
not just at the end of
life. It involves the whole
person, not just their
cancer.

part of cancer care. If you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed,
ask your treatment team for help.

What is advance care
planning?

Distress

Many patients with cancer experience
symptoms of distress, such as anxiety and
depression. You may feel anxious during
testing, or you may experience depression
during a hard part of treatment. Feeling
distressed may be a minor problem but it can
also be more serious. Serious or not, tell your
treatment team so that you can get help. Help
can include support groups, talk therapy, or
medication. At your cancer center, cancer
navigators, social workers, and other experts
can help. Some people also feel better by
exercising, talking with loved ones, or relaxing.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, 2022

When cancer is diagnosed very late or keeps
progressing despite all treatment eﬀorts, it may
be time to set some new goals. If it becomes
clear that cure is not possible, treatment
becomes about making the most of your time
and assuring that you can meet death on your
own terms.
Advance care planning is all about making
sure that your wishes are understood and
respected. The focus is on you receiving the
best possible care at the end of your life.
Patients with incurable cancer can set up
an advance care plan early on to feel less
stressed and better able to cope with their
condition.

Supportive care and end-of-life concerns

What is hospice care?

The advance care planning process starts
with an open and honest discussion with your
doctor about your prognosis—what you may
experience in the coming months—and the
medications or therapies that may give you
the best quality of life. Quality of life refers to
a person’s overall enjoyment of life, including
their sense of well-being and ability to
participate in regular activities.

Hospice is a type of care designed to provide
medical, psychological, and spiritual support
for people who are close to the end-of-life as
well as the people who love them. The goal
is comfort, not a cure. Many insurance plans
will only cover hospice services if your doctor
has said that your life expectancy is 6 months
or less and that you will not be receiving
treatment designed to cure cancer.

This discussion should include your spouse
or partner and other family members who love
you and are likely to be with you at the end. It’s
important that everyone understands the goals
of your care and your personal wishes about
what should—and should not—be done.

Hospice care is all about your quality of life.
Services can be provided in your home, a
hospice facility, or even in the hospital. A major
goal is to keep you pain-free and make sure
that you can leave this world comfortably
and with dignity. Hospice doctors, nurses,
social workers, and chaplains are experts in
helping patients work through the spiritual and
emotional challenges of coping with the end of
life.

Once you’ve made these decisions, you’ll
fill out a legal document that explains what
you want to be done if you aren’t able to
tell the doctors yourself. This document is
called an advance directive. Doctors are
required to follow the care instructions in an
advance directive when you are too ill to give
instructions about your care.

Because hospice care is focused on making
you as comfortable as possible, the hospice
team may stop medications that aren’t adding
anything to your overall quality of life. The
goal is to ensure that you don’t have to take
any more pills or injections than are absolutely
necessary.

Your advance directive should also identify a
person who is authorized to make decisions
on your behalf (health care proxy) if you can’t
communicate. This person may one day have
to make some very tough decisions, so you
should think carefully when selecting your
proxy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, 2022

What is hospice care?

Providing support for family members is a
major part of the hospice approach to endof-life care. Most programs oﬀer counseling
and support groups for family members,
including support after the patient has died.
This is referred to as bereavement. It can be
enormously comforting to know that your loved
ones will have that kind of support after you’re
gone.

Supportive care and end-of-life concerns

Key points


Supportive care is treatment that involves
the whole person, not just their cancer.



Supportive care is given at any stage of
disease, not just at the end of life.



If you smoke, ask for help with quitting.



If you’re feeling distressed, ask about
ways to reduce anxiety or depression.



Advance care planning is done to
ensure that your end-of-life wishes are
understood and respected.



An advance directive is a legal document
that explains your care if you’re too ill to
give instructions about it yourself.

Hospice is care for people who are close
to the end of life. It’s focused on comfort
and quality of life.

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable with
the treatment you choose. This choice
starts with having an open and honest
conversation with your doctors.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
If you make the eﬀort to build a relationship
with your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Deciding on your treatment options

Choosing your treatment is a very important
decision. It can aﬀect your length and quality
of life. But deciding which treatment option is
best can be hard. Doctors from diﬀerent fields
of medicine may have diﬀerent opinions on
which option is best for you. This can be very
confusing. Also, your spouse, partner, or family
members may disagree with which option you
want. That can be stressful. In some cases,
one option hasn’t been shown to work better
than another.

Treatment decisions are very personal. What’s
important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:


What you want and how that might diﬀer
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Your feelings about pain or side eﬀects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, 2022

Second opinion

People with cancer often want to get treated
as soon as possible. They want to make their
cancer go away before it spreads farther.
While cancer can’t be ignored, there’s usually
enough time to think about and choose which
option is best for you.
You may completely trust your doctor, but a
second opinion about which option is best
can help. A second opinion is when another
doctor reviews your test results and suggests a
treatment plan. Copies of the pathology report,
imaging, and other test results need to be sent
to the doctor who’s giving the second opinion.
Some people feel uneasy asking for copies
from their doctors. However, a second opinion
is a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors
get second opinions!

58

7

Making treatment decisions

Questions to ask your doctors

Some health plans even require a second
opinion. If your health plan doesn’t cover
the cost of a second opinion, you have the
choice of paying for it yourself.
If the two opinions are the same, you may
feel more at peace about treatment. If the
two opinions diﬀer, think about getting a third
opinion. A third opinion may help you decide
between your options.

Get group support
Many people with cancer find a lot of
value in a support group. In support
groups, you can ask questions and hear
about the experiences of other people
with cancer. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment.

Things you can do to prepare for a second
opinion:


Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



Compare benefits and downsides. Every
option has benefits and downsides.
Consider both when deciding which
option is best for you. Talking to others
can help identify benefits and downsides
you haven’t thought of. Scoring each
factor from 0 to 10 can also help because
some factors may be more important to
you than others.

A support group can help with emotional
and psychological needs. A support group
can also be a good source of practical
advice and helpful tips. People with
common ground can share information
on their experiences, financial and
emotional burdens, coping strategies,
and knowledge about research and
treatments.
Ask your doctors or supportive care team
about finding a mesothelioma or cancer
support community. Support groups can
be found online and in-person groups are
often available in larger communities.

Questions to ask your doctors
Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own. Be
