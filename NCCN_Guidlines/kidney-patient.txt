About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Kidney Cancer, Version 2.2025 – September 6, 2024.

The kidneys

The kidneys are a pair of organs
found behind the other organs

The kidneys are a pair of organs found behind
the other organs in your abdomen. Each
kidney is about the size of an adult’s fist. The
kidney is covered by a thin layer of tissue, like
the skin of an apple. This layer of tissue is
called the renal capsule. Renal refers to the
kidney.

in your abdomen. The kidneys
make hormones and filter blood
to remove waste and extra water
from the body. This chapter will
discuss the kidneys and provide

The kidneys are part of the urinary system.
The urinary system is a group of organs
that remove waste from the body in the form
of urine (or pee). This system includes the
kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The
kidneys make hormones that help control
blood pressure. They also make hormones
that tell the body to make more red blood cells.
By filtering the blood, the kidneys also control
and balance the levels of fluids and chemicals
in your body.

an overview of kidney cancer.

The kidneys and
urinary system
The kidneys are the main organs
of the urinary system. The ureters,
bladder, and urethra hold and
transport urine before it is released
from the body.

1 About kidney cancer » How the kidneys work

An adrenal gland sits on top of each kidney.
The kidney and adrenal gland are surrounded
by a layer of fat. Covering the fat is an outer
layer of fibrous tissue called Gerota’s fascia.
When kidney cancer grows into and beyond
Gerota’s fascia, it is a sign of advanced kidney
cancer.

The renal artery carries blood with waste
into the kidney. Blood then flows through
tiny filtering tubes in the kidney called renal
tubules. Blood is cleaned as it flows through
the renal tubules. The renal tubules remove
waste and other substances from the blood.
These substances are made into urine.
The clean, filtered blood flows out of the kidney
through the renal vein. The renal vein merges
with a larger vein called the vena cava. The
vena cava takes clean blood back up to the
heart.

How the kidneys work
The kidneys perform many jobs to keep your
body healthy. The main job of the kidneys
is to filter blood to remove waste and extra
water from the body. By filtering the blood, the
kidneys also control and balance the levels of
fluids and chemicals in your body.

Urine flows out of the renal tubules and
collects in a hollow space in the middle of the
kidney called the renal pelvis. Urine leaves
the renal pelvis through a long tube called the

The kidneys filter blood to remove waste
Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery. Renal tubules remove excess water and
other waste from the blood to make urine. Urine drips out of the renal tubules into the renal
pelvis, then leaves the kidney through the ureter. Clean, filtered blood leaves the kidney
through the renal vein.

The bladder holds urine until it is released from
the body when you urinate (or pee). A shorter
tube, called the urethra, takes urine from the
bladder to outside the body.

called transitional call cancer. For more
information, see NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Bladder Cancer, available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.


Most people have two kidneys. However, each
kidney works on its own and does not need the
other to function. This means that the body can
often work well with less than one complete
kidney. Many people live full, healthy lives with
only one kidney.



Kidney cancer
Kidney cancer starts in the tissues of the
kidneys. Almost all kidney cancers are
carcinomas. Carcinomas are cancers that start
in cells that line the inner or outer surfaces
of the body. In the kidneys, carcinomas most
often start in the cells that line the renal
tubules. This is called renal cell carcinoma
(RCC). About 9 out of 10 kidney cancers are
RCCs. RCC may appear as multiple tumors in
one kidney or involve both kidneys. Because it
is the most common type, RCC is often simply
referred to as kidney cancer. RCC is the focus
of this book.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most
common type of kidney cancer. RCC can be
broken down into subtypes by looking at the
cancer cells under a microscope. This is called
histology. Tumor histology and other factors are
an important part of choosing a treatment plan.
Ask your care team about your cancer subtype.

Urothelial carcinoma starts in the
cells that line the renal pelvis and ureter
that drain the kidney. While these tumors
can be found up the ureter near the
kidneys, they are not kidney tumors.
These tumors share many features with
bladder cancer. These tumors used to be

org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

RCC subtypes

There are other, less common cancers that can
arise in the kidney. While they can sometimes
be confused with RCC, it is important to note
that they are treated differently.


Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma)
usually occurs in young children. In Wilms
tumor (WT), cancer cells are found in the
kidney.

Clear cell RCC
Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common
subtype. It occurs in about 7 out of 10 people
with RCC. Under a microscope, clear cells look
very pale or clear.

descent who carry the sickle cell trait,
sickle cell disease, or other diseases that
can cause sickling of the red blood cells.

Non-clear cell RCC is also called nccRCC
There are several subtypes.






Papillary RCC is the most common
subtype of nccRCC (about 1 out of 10
people with RCC). Most papillary tumors
look like long, thin finger-like growths
under a microscope. It is also called
PRCC.



Chromophobe RCC cells are pale, but
larger than clear cells, and look different.

Rare types of nccRCC

Collecting duct RCC (cdRCC) forms
in the cells of the collecting ducts or
tubules.

tubes in the kidney called
renal tubules.

Unclassified RCC describes cancer
cells that don’t look like any of the
subtypes or more than one subtype is
present.

Some other RCC types that have been defined
recently include:

Other rare types of nccRCC include the
following:


Translocation RCC can be found
at all ages but tends to be diagnosed
in children or younger adults. These
tumors have unique fusions of genes that
promote the cancer.

1 About kidney cancer » How kidney cancer spreads » Key points

Sarcomatoid features

Treatment will be based on the size, known
or suspected subtype, and location of the
tumor(s).

Almost any type of renal cell carcinoma
can become sarcomatoid (sRCC) or have
sarcomatoid features. This means that the
cells of the cancer look like the cells of a
sarcoma (cancer of the connective tissues,
such as muscles, nerves, fat, blood vessels,
and fibrous tissue). Sarcomatoid renal cancers
occur in less than 10% of RCC tumors but
when present tend to grow more quickly than
other types of kidney cancer and are more
likely to spread to other parts of the body. This
makes them more difficult to treat.

Key points






How kidney cancer spreads
Tumors can grow in any part of the kidney and
can grow into the renal vein and vena cava.
Kidney cancer can also spread to other parts
of the body in a process called metastasis. In
metastasis, cancer cells travel through your
blood or lymph to form new tumors outside
of the kidney. The new tumors are called
metastatic tumors or metastases.








Local spread – In locally advanced
disease, cancer has spread to a nearby
area close to the primary tumor. Kidney
cancer can invade nearby tissues like
surrounding fat, blood vessels, lymph
nodes, adrenal glands, and Gerota’s
fascia.





Distant metastasis – In metastatic
disease, cancer has spread to distant
parts of the body far from the primary site.
Kidney cancer tends to spread to distant
sites such as the lungs, lymph nodes,
and bones, and less frequently to the liver
and brain. Multiple tumors in one or both
kidneys are not considered metastasis and
are treated as separate primary tumors.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Kidney Cancer, 2025

The kidneys filter blood to remove extra
water and other waste the body doesn’t
need.
Blood flows into the kidney through the
renal artery and out through the renal
vein.
Renal tubules are tiny tubes in the
kidneys that remove waste from blood
and make urine.
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) starts in cells
that line the renal tubules. RCC is the
most common type of kidney cancer and
is the focus of the book. Clear cell RCC
and non-clear cell RCC are subtypes.
Almost any type of RCC can become
sarcomatoid (sRCC) or have sarcomatoid
features.
Tumors can grow in any part of the kidney
and can grow into the renal vein and vena
cava.
Treatment for RCC is based on histology,
tumor(s) size and location, and if cancer
has metastasized to other areas in the
body.



It's beneficial to have a support
system in place during diagnosis
and treatment. Enlist the help of
friends, family members, or peers
who can provide transportation,
meals, and emotional support.
These can be different people for
different tasks or change over time.
Consider bringing someone with
you to doctor visits if possible or
have someone on the phone or join
you for telehealth visits.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Kidney Cancer, 2025

Don’t hesitate to ask questions and take
notes during appointments. Write down
questions and ask a friend or family
member to take notes. Caregivers should
ask questions, too.
Organize your medical documents,
including insurance forms, medical
records, and test results. Keep a list of
contact information for your care team
and update your primary care physician
(PCP) regarding any changes. Include
details about the specific type of cancer,
treatment, and dates in your contact list.
Ask your care team how best to
communicate with them, especially in an
emergency.

General health tests




Some general health tests are described next.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.



Complete blood count and
differential
A complete blood count (CBC) measures
the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in
your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells fight
infection, and platelets control bleeding. A
differential counts the number of each type of
white blood cell. It also checks if the counts are
in balance with each other.

Comprehensive metabolic panel

Physical exam

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures substances in your blood. It is
usually done on the plasma part of your blood.
A CMP provides important information about
how well your kidneys and liver are working,
among other things. A CMP might include
a serum creatinine test, liver function tests
(LFTs), and a urinalysis. These tests might
also be called blood chemistry tests.

During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:
Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate
Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Kidney Cancer, 2025

Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into a vein in your
arm. Some blood tests are described next.

Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your care team will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history. Ask family members on both
sides of your family about their health issues
like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes,
and at what age they were diagnosed. It’s
important to know the specific type of cancer
or where the cancer started, if it is in multiple
locations, and if they had genetic testing.



Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.

2 Diagnosing kidney cancer » Urine tests

Alkaline phosphatase

Liver function tests

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme
found in the blood. High levels of ALP can be a
sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver. A
bone scan might be performed if you have high
levels of ALP.

Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that are
made or processed by the liver. Levels that
are too high or low signal that the liver is not
working well or that cancer has spread to the
liver.

Calcium

Urine tests

Calcium is the most common mineral in the
body. It is needed for healthy teeth, bones,
and other body tissues. You might have higher
calcium levels if your kidneys aren’t working
normally. Bone damage from cancer can
cause your bones to release calcium into the
bloodstream.

Urine tests look for signs of disease and
assess your general health. Abnormal results
may signal there’s a problem with your kidneys
or other organs. Abnormal results may be
caused by kidney cancer or other health
conditions. For a urine test, you will be asked
to fill a small container with urine. The urine
sample will be sent to a lab for testing.

Creatinine
Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles.
Every person generates a fixed amount of
creatinine every day based on how much
muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the
blood tells how well the kidneys are working.
Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys
aren’t working as well as they were when
someone had lower levels of creatinine.

Urinalysis
A urinalysis detects and/or measures several
substances in the urine using a microscope
and chemical tests. Blood in urine (hematuria)
may be caused by kidney cancer or other
health problems. Those with kidney cancer
may have a normal urinalysis or have evidence
of blood in the urine.

Lactate dehydrogenase

Urine cytology

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into the blood.
Fast-growing cells, such as tumor cells, also
release LDH.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Kidney Cancer, 2025

In urine cytology, urine is looked at under a
microscope to check for cancer cells. This
test may be used if your care team suspects
urothelial cancer in the urinary tract or bladder.

13

2 Diagnosing kidney cancer » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your chest,
abdomen, and/or pelvis may be one of the
tests to look for cancer. In most cases, contrast
will be used.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your
body. Imaging tests show the primary tumor, or
where the cancer started, and look for cancer
in other parts of the body. A radiologist, an
expert in interpreting imaging tests, will write a
report and send this report to your health care
provider (HCP). While these reports might be
available to you through your patient portal or
patient access system, please wait to discuss
these results with your care team.

MRI scan
An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

You will have some, but not all of the following
tests. If you have questions about why a test is
or isn't recommended, ask your HCP.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are substances that help enhance
and improve the images of several organs and
structures in the body. It is used to make the
pictures clearer. The contrast is not permanent
and will leave your body in your urine
immediately after the test. The types of contrast
vary and are different for CT and MRI.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.
MRI is most often used to evaluate the
abdomen and pelvis, but may also be used to
look at possible tumor spread (metastasis) in
the brain.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

Bone scan
Kidney cancer can spread to bones. A bone
scan uses a radiotracer, a substance that
releases small amounts of radiation. Before
the pictures are taken, the tracer will be
injected into your vein. It can take a few hours
for the tracer to enter your bones. However,
the test is quick and painless.

CT scan
A CT or CAT (computed tomography) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Kidney Cancer, 2025

14

2 Diagnosing kidney cancer » Imaging tests

A special camera will take pictures of the
tracer in your bones as it moves over your
body. Areas of bone damage take up more
radiotracer than healthy bone and show up
as bright spots on the pictures. Bone damage
can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment,
previous injuries, or other health issues. This
test may be used if you have bone pain, are at
high risk for bone metastases, or if there are
changes in certain test results. Bone scans
might be used to monitor treatment.

gel. Ultrasound is painless and does not use
x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed. An
ultrasound can show if there is a mass in your
kidney and if the mass is solid or fluid-filled. It
can also help evaluate if the mass has blood
flow. Kidney cancer tumors are more likely to
be solid and have blood flow.

X-ray
An x-ray is a type of radiation. In small doses,
it is used to make pictures of the inside of the
body. A chest x-ray is used to see if cancer has
spread to the lungs. It might be referred to as a
radiograph.

Ultrasound
An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer)
will be held and moved on your skin using

2 Diagnosing kidney cancer » Biopsy » Biomarker testing

Biopsy

Biopsy results
Histology is the study of the anatomy
(structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under
a microscope. It is used to make treatment
decisions. Your pathology report will contain
information about histology

A biopsy removes a sample of tissue or fluid.
Samples removed during a biopsy or surgery
will be sent to a pathologist, an expert in
examining cells under a microscope to confirm
the presence of cancer. The pathologist will
determine the cancer subtype called tumor
histology.

Biomarker testing

For most cancers, a biopsy must be done
to confirm cancer before starting cancer
treatment. However, for many with a high
suspicion of kidney cancer that appears to be
contained to the kidney, the primary treatment
is surgery to remove the tumor. After the tumor
is removed, it is tested (biopsied).

A sample from a biopsy of your tumor
may be tested to look for specific DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations,
protein levels, or other molecular features. It is
sometimes called molecular testing or tumor
profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression
profiling, or genomic testing. These tests are
more commonly done in those with advanced
disease to choose the best treatment for you.

Other types of biopsies may include:




Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or fine
needle biopsy (FNB) uses a thin needle
to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. An
ultrasound may guide the FNA biopsy.

Biomarker testing includes tests of genes or
their products (proteins). Proteins are written
like this: SDHB (which stands for Succinate
Dehydrogenase Complex Iron Sulfur Subunit
B). Genes are written with italics like this:
SDHB.

Core needle biopsy (CNB) removes
tissue samples with a hollow needle about
the same size as a needle used for an IV
(intravenous) line.

Tumor mutation testing

Biopsy of metastases

Tumor mutation testing, tumor genomic
aberration testing, or somatic testing uses a
sample of your tumor or blood to see if the
cancer cells have any specific DNA mutations.
This is a different type of DNA testing than the
genetic risk testing for mutations you may have
inherited from your biological parents (called
germline testing). In tumor mutation testing,
only the tumor is tested. Some mutations can
be targeted with specific therapies. These
tests are more commonly done in those with
advanced disease.

Metastasis is the spread of cancer to an area
of the body such as lung, bone, or brain. A
biopsy of the metastasis may be needed to
confirm the presence of cancer. If there is
more than one metastasis, each site may be
biopsied. The type of biopsy used depends on
the location of the suspected metastases and
other factors.

2 Diagnosing kidney cancer » Genetic risk testing » Performance status

Genetic risk testing

you have a hereditary syndrome that puts you
at risk for developing kidney cancer, along with
possibly other cancers or medical issues.

You might be thinking why did I get cancer?
Most of the time, the answer is one cell made
a mistake when dividing and then a cancer
formed. Some, however, have a predisposition
or have something in their DNA (genetic
material) that makes them more likely to
develop cancer. Understanding whether you
have a cancer predisposition condition can
sometimes affect your cancer treatment, but
more often, it can affect screening for other
cancers. Therefore, identifying a cancer
predisposition condition is important.



It is important that those who have hereditary
causes of RCC see their doctors often,
especially if they have already been diagnosed
with RCC. Those with confirmed hereditary
causes of RCC will be monitored differently
than those with sporadic RCC. You will have
regular testing to check for a new kidney
tumor and may also need follow up with other
specialists depending on the type of hereditary
RCC.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). The
goal is to look for gene mutations inherited
from your biological parents called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You can
pass these genes on to your children. Also,
family members might carry these mutations.
Tell your care team if there is a family history
of cancer.

Performance status
Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be rated
using a PS scale called Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) or the Karnofsky
Performance Score (KPS). PS is one factor
taken into consideration when choosing
a treatment plan. Your preferences about
treatment are always important.

Hereditary cancer predisposition
syndromes
Certain genetic (inherited) syndromes may put
someone at risk for developing kidney cancer.
A syndrome is a group of signs or symptoms
that occur together and suggest the presence

Results from blood tests, imaging studies,
and possible biopsy will determine your
treatment plan. Often, information is
collected over time, even as treatment
begins.

Those with kidney cancer should be
treated at centers experienced in this
type of cancer.

Blood and urine tests check for signs of
disease and how well organs are working.
Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Imaging tests are used to find
and diagnose kidney cancer.
A biopsy removes a sample of tissue or
fluid for testing. Biopsies are not always
done before surgery for kidney cancer if
the tumor appears to be contained in the
kidney. The tumor is usually tested after
removal.
A sample of your tumor may be tested to
look for specific DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) mutations, protein levels, or other
molecular features. Some mutations
and proteins can be targeted with
specific therapies. These tests are more
commonly done in those with advanced
disease.
Genetic risk testing might be done to
look for gene mutations, inherited from
your biological parents, called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer.
A genetic syndrome that puts someone
at risk for developing kidney cancer and
possibly other cancers is called hereditary
renal cell carcinoma (HRCC).

How is kidney cancer
staged?

The extent (size) of the tumor (T): How
large is the cancer? Has it grown into
nearby areas?
The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N):
Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph
nodes? If so, how many? Where?
The spread (metastasis) to distant sites
(M): Has the cancer spread to distant
organs such as the lungs or liver?
Grade of the cancer (G): How much do
the cancer cells look like normal cells?

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins.

A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging.

Staging includes:


Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A
prognosis is the course your cancer will likely
take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.



Anatomic – based on extent of cancer
as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node
status (N), and distant metastasis (M).
Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM
plus tumor grade and other factors such
as performance status. The prognostic
stage also includes the assumption that
you are treated with the standard-of-care
approaches.

Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and
pathologic. Cancer staging is often done twice,
before and after surgery. Staging after surgery
provides more specific and accurate details
about the size of the cancer, what tissue or
organs may be involved, and the presence of
cancer in lymph nodes.

3 Kidney cancer staging » How is kidney cancer staged?

Clinical stage

Pathologic stage

Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before
any treatment. It is based on a physical
exam, imaging tests, and possible biopsy. An
example might look like cN2 or cM1. In kidney
cancer, the clinical (before surgery) stage is
based mainly on imaging results. These tests
are done before any treatment as part of an
initial diagnosis. Surgery is needed to know
exactly how much cancer is in the body.

Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is
determined by examining tissue removed
during surgery. An example might be pN2. If
you are given drug therapy before surgery,
then the stage might look like ypT3. The
pathologic (after surgery) stage is based on
information gained after surgery to remove
all or part of the kidney and nearby lymph
nodes. This gives a more accurate picture of
how far the cancer has spread and is used to
determine your treatment options after surgery.
The removal of tumor tissue is an important
part of pathologic staging.

Kidney tumors are measured in centimeters: A baseball is 7 cm, a golf ball is 4 cm, and
a pea is 1 cm.

3 Kidney cancer staging » TNM scores

TNM scores

N = Regional lymph node
There are hundreds of lymph nodes
throughout your body. They work as filters to
help fight infection and remove harmful things
from your body. Regional lymph nodes are
found near the kidney. Regional lymph nodes
include renal hilar, caval, and aortic. Cancer
found in a regional lymph node is called a
lymph node metastasis. This is different than a
distant metastasis, which is found far from the
main tumor in the kidney.

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage kidney cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different areas
of cancer growth. Based on imaging and
pathology results, each letter will be assigned
a score or number. The higher the number,
the larger the tumor or the more the cancer
has spread. These scores will be combined
to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM example
might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M0.






The removal of lymph nodes is called lymph
node or nodal dissection.

T is for tumor – Depth and size of the
main (primary) tumor in the kidney
N is for node – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes



M is for metastasis – If cancer has
spread to distant parts of the body





T = Tumor
A tumor can grow outside the kidney and
into nearby structures. Kidney tumors are
measured in centimeters (cm). A baseball is 7
cm, a golf ball is 4 cm, and a pea is 1 cm. Your
kidney is about the size of your fist or about 11
cm by 5 cm.








N0 – No regional lymph node metastasis
is found
N1 – Metastasis in regional lymph
node(s) is found

M = Metastasis
Cancer that has spread to distant parts of the
body is shown as M1. The most common site
for metastasis is the bone, liver, lungs, brain,
adrenal glands, and distant lymph nodes.

T1 – Tumor is 7 cm or smaller and is
limited to the kidney

Grade

T2 – Tumor is larger than 7 cm and is
limited to the kidney

Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells
look under a microscope (called histology).
Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread
faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means
the grade can’t be determined, followed by G1,
G2, G3, and G4. G4 is the highest grade for
renal cell carcinoma. Tumors with sarcomatoid
features are considered G4.

T3 – Tumor extends outside the kidney
into major veins and tissues, but not into
Gerota’s fascia
T4 – Tumor invades beyond Gerota’s
fascia and might be in the adrenal gland

Numbered stages

Stage I
T1, N0, M0

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores.
Stages range from stage 1 to stage 4, with 4
being the most advanced. They might be written
as stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV.

The tumor is found only in the kidney and is
smaller than 7 cm (T1). Cancer has not spread
to nearby lymph nodes (N0) or to other parts of
the body (M0).

only in the kidney (T2). Cancer has not spread
to nearby lymph nodes (N0) or to other parts of
the body (M0).

Unresectable – Tumor cannot be
removed completely with surgery. The
tumor might involve nearby veins and
arteries making it unsafe to remove.

Stage 3
T1 or T2, N1, M0

Locoregional or locally advanced
– This refers to a tumor that has spread
to or beyond the blood vessels, tissue,
organs, or lymph nodes surrounding the
kidney. It may be a stage 3 or 4 tumor,
depending on how far outside the kidney
the tumor has spread.

The tumor is found only in the kidney (T1 or
T2), but cancer has spread (metastasized)
to nearby lymph nodes (N1). This is locally
advanced kidney cancer. Cancer has not
metastasized to distant sites (M0). The tumor

Metastatic – Cancer that has spread to
other parts of the body, including distant
lymph nodes. The most common sites
are the lungs, lymph nodes, bones, liver,

A cancer stage helps to predict the likely
course your cancer will take, called a
prognosis. It describes the size and
location of the tumor and if cancer has
spread to lymph nodes, organs, or other
parts of the body.
Staging is used to make treatment
decisions.
In stage 1 kidney cancer, the tumor is
7 cm or smaller and found only in the
kidney.
In stage 2 kidney cancer, the tumor is
larger than 7 cm and found only in the
kidney.
In stage 3 kidney cancer, the tumor has
grown outside the kidney into nearby
veins and tissues but has not grown into
the adrenal gland or beyond Gerota’s
fascia. Cancer may or may not be in
nearby lymph nodes. Cancer has not
spread to distant sites.
In stage 4 kidney cancer, the tumor can
be any size. It may have spread outside
the kidney. Not all stage 4 kidney cancer
is metastatic.

Ablation

also be inserted and guided into place during
laparoscopic surgery.

Ablation is a type of treatment that uses
extreme cold or heat, radio waves,
microwaves, or chemicals such as ethanol
(a type of alcohol) or acetic acid to destroy
cancer cells. It can destroy small tumors
(typically 3 cm or less) and metastases with
little harm to nearby tissue. You might have
multiple treatments to destroy the tumor or
metastasis. Ablation might be used if you are
not healthy enough for surgery or you strongly
wish to avoid surgery. A biopsy might be done
before or at the time of ablation.

Imaging tests are used to monitor the tumor
during treatment to make sure the whole
tumor is destroyed (ablated). The probe will be
removed when treatment is done.

Active surveillance
Active surveillance happens before
treatment.
Surveillance or follow-up care happens
after treatment.

There are many types of ablation used to
destroy cancer cells. Those most commonly
used to treat a small kidney tumor or an
isolated metastasis include:






Active surveillance closely monitors tumor
growth. During this time, you will have imaging
tests on a regular basis. You will not have
treatment. Treatment will start if the tumor
grows or if you are having pain or discomfort.
There may be other reasons to start treatment.
Ask your care team what might trigger the
need for treatment and how often you will have
imaging tests.

Cryoablation, cryotherapy, or
cryosurgery kills cancer cells by
freezing them with a very cold substance.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) kills
cancer cells by heating them with highenergy radio waves.
Microwave ablation refers to the use
of electromagnetic energy to kill cancer
cells.

Active surveillance may be an option for
a tumor smaller than 2 cm that has not
metastasized or in those with other serious
health issues who may not be healthy enough
for surgery or other treatments. Age and other
health conditions increase the risk of severe
side effects and complications from treatment.

All types of ablation use a special needle,
called a probe, which is inserted into the
tumor, metastasis, or lesion. With cryotherapy,
a medical gas is passed through the probe
to cause below-freezing temperatures. This
freezes the tumor to destroy it. With RFA, the
probe emits radio waves to heat the tumor and
destroy it. The probe can be inserted through
the skin and guided into place with a CT scan,
ultrasound, or other imaging tests. It can

Surgery

Minimally invasive surgery
Minimally invasive surgery (key-hole surgery)
uses a few small incisions. Small tools are
inserted through each incision to perform the
surgery. One of the tools, called a laparoscope,
is a long tube with a video camera at the
end. The camera lets your surgeon see your
kidney and other tissues inside your abdomen.
Other tools are used to remove the tumor.
Laparoscopic surgery can also be done using
robotic arms to control the surgical tools. This
is called robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery.

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. Often, surgery
is the main or primary treatment to remove the
cancer from the kidney. This is only one part
of a treatment plan. Surgery can also provide
supportive care by easing pain or discomfort.
This is called palliative surgery.
When preparing for surgery, you should seek
the opinion of an experienced surgeon. The
surgeon should be an expert in performing
your type of surgery. Hospitals that perform
many surgeries often have better results. You
can ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer
center that has experience in treating your type
of cancer.

Tumor resection
The removal of the tumor is called tumor
resection. Imaging tests will be ordered to see
if your cancer is resectable (can be removed
completely by surgery) or unresectable
(cannot be removed completely by surgery).
Sometimes, imaging tests cannot clearly show
one way or the other.

The removal of the cancer through surgery can
be accomplished in different ways depending
on the specific circumstances, such as the
size and location of the tumor, and if there is
cancer in any surrounding organs and tissues.
Surgery is based on the safest and best way to
remove the cancer.

Partial nephrectomy
In a partial nephrectomy, the tumor and tissue
immediately surrounding the tumor is removed,
leaving behind a still-functioning kidney. The
adrenal gland and lymph nodes are also left
in your body. A partial nephrectomy might
be referred to as nephron-sparing or kidneysparing surgery since it saves (spares)
as much of your kidney as possible. Your
kidney can still function even if part of it has
been removed. This is a benefit of partial
nephrectomy. If you have poor kidney function
or are at risk for poor kidney function, this
surgery might be an option. It might be an
option if you have only one kidney, limited
kidney function, or tumors in both kidneys.

Open surgery
Open surgery or laparotomy removes tissue
through one large surgical cut below your ribs.
This approach lets your surgeon directly view
and access the tumor in your kidney to remove
it. Open surgery may take several hours or
longer. After the surgery, you will need to stay
in the hospital to recover.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Kidney Cancer, 2025

4 Treating kidney cancer » Surgery

Partial nephrectomy is often used for treating
kidney cancer when the tumor is small and
only in the kidney. A partial nephrectomy can
be used to remove larger tumors, but location
of the tumor in your kidney and your overall
health are considered in any type of surgery.
For most small tumors, a partial nephrectomy
can remove all the cancer with good long-term
results. The surgeon’s skill and experience
are key factors. Therefore, seek out an
experienced surgeon.

This surgery should only be done when the
entire tumor can be safely removed, leaving
the healthy part of the kidney intact.
With any type of surgery, there are health risks
and side effects. A side effect is an unhealthy
or unpleasant condition caused by treatment.
Some possible side effects of a partial
nephrectomy include infections, bleeding, pain
from the surgical cuts, and urine leaking from
the kidney.

Partial nephrectomy is a complex surgery.
It is more technically difficult than surgery
that removes the whole kidney. A partial
nephrectomy should only be done by an expert
surgeon who does this type of surgery often.

Radical nephrectomy



A radical nephrectomy is surgery that removes
the tumor with the whole kidney and the fatty
tissue around the kidney. This surgery may
also remove the adrenal gland (found on top
of the kidney) and nearby lymph nodes. How
much tissue is removed depends on the extent
of the tumor.


Lymph node dissection removes
nearby lymph nodes. A lymph node
dissection is not often done as part of a
standard radical nephrectomy. Nearby
lymph nodes may be removed if they
look enlarged on imaging tests or during
surgery.

If the tumor has grown into the renal vein and
vena cava, then the veins may be cut open
to remove all of the cancer. In rare cases,
your heart may need to be stopped for a short
time for surgery on the vena cava. While the
heart is stopped, a heart-lung machine is used
to circulate blood in the body. This is a very
difficult and complex procedure. It should only

Adrenalectomy removes an adrenal
gland. The attached adrenal gland may
be removed if it looks abnormal on
imaging tests. It may also be removed

necessary to consider removal of the tumor
if a person develops health issues due to the
kidney tumor, such as blood in the urine or
severe pain.

Radical nephrectomy is used to treat kidney
cancer when the tumor is large or has invaded
nearby tissue. There are many factors that go
into deciding which type of surgery might be
best for your cancer. Each case is different.
Each person is different.

Cytoreductive surgery
Not all cancer can be removed from your body
with surgery when there are many metastases.
Removing some of the cancer metastases,
along with the primary tumor, and part or all of
your kidney, might help to reduce the amount
of cancer in your body, called cancer burden.
The goal of cytoreductive surgery is to reduce
cancer burden.

With any type of surgery, there are risks. Some
possible side effects of a radical nephrectomy
include infection, bleeding, pain, and reduced
kidney function. Since the whole kidney is
removed, there is an increased risk for chronic
kidney disease (CKD). CKD means your
remaining kidney can’t filter blood the way it
should. Kidney function may slowly get worse
over a long period of time.

Metastasectomy
New tumors that formed far from the
primary tumor are called metastases.
A metastasectomy is different from a
mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast). A
metastasectomy is surgery to remove one or
more metastases. This surgery may be used
when the primary tumor can be completely
removed and there is only one metastasis. Not
all metastases can be removed by surgery.
Location is a key factor. Metastasectomy
works best for metastases in the brain, bone,
or lung.

Cytoreductive nephrectomy
A cytoreductive nephrectomy is surgery to
remove the primary tumor when you have
metastatic kidney cancer. Metastatic cancer
has spread from where it first formed to other
parts of your body. Cytoreductive surgery
is often used to prolong life, reduce pain, or
improve quality of life, but not as a cure. Some
or all of your kidney might be removed along
with the primary tumor in a cytoreductive
nephrectomy. Removing the primary tumor
may improve how well other treatments work
against the remaining cancer and metastases.

A metastasectomy may be done at the same
time as surgery to remove the primary tumor,
or it may be done during a separate operation.
The amount of time needed for the surgery
and recovery depends on many factors. Some
factors include the size and location of the
metastases.

A cytoreductive nephrectomy is usually
followed by a targeted therapy and/or
immunotherapy. It can also be considered
in unique cases when the metastases have
responded to treatment and there is a large
primary tumor. This is sometimes referred
to as consolidative surgery. It may also be

photons or protons. With this method you will
receive high-dose radiation for 1 to 5 treatments.
SBRT is very precise, which reduces the chance
of damage to nearby tissues.

Oligometastases are a type of metastasis in
which cancer cells from the original (primary)
tumor travel through the body and form a
small number of new tumors (metastatic
tumors) in other parts of the body. Treatment
for oligometastases or oligometastatic disease
includes metastasectomy, radiation therapy, or
ablation.

Systemic therapy
Systemic (drug) therapy works throughout
the body. Types include, targeted therapy,
immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Systemic
therapy might be used alone or with other
therapies. Goals of systemic therapy may be
curative or palliative and should be discussed
before starting treatment. Your wishes about
treatment are important. Make your wishes
known.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, electrons,
and other sources to kill cancer cells and
shrink tumors. RT may be used as an ablative
therapy instead of surgery, or as a supportive
care or palliative care to help ease pain or
discomfort caused by cancer.



Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is
used to treat kidney cancer. In SBRT, a machine
outside the body aims radiation beams at the
tumor. The goal is to kill or ablate the tumor
or metastasis. SBRT can be done with either

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique

to treat stage 4 (with or without metastases)
kidney cancer or cancer that has returned

fewer side effects than other types of cancer
treatment.

If it ends in limus, it is an mTOR.

In kidney cancer, targeted therapy is used in
the following ways:

Monoclonal antibodies affect the
outside or surface of the cancer cell. A
monoclonal antibody (mAb) is a lab-grown
protein. There are many kinds of mAbs.



Kinase inhibitors affect the inside of
the cancer cell. Kinases move chemicals,
called phosphates, from one molecule
to another. By transferring phosphates,
kinases send signals that tell cells to
grow. Kinase inhibitors block these
signals.

cancer cells to grow and make more cancer
cells. Often, these drugs have more than one
target. Targeted therapy drugs are named
based on what they target.

There are 3 types of targeted therapy:


•



33

Angiogenesis inhibitors target blood
vessel growth by blocking vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or
vascular endothelial growth factor
receptors (VEGFR).
Hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α) inhibitors interfere with a cancer
cell’s ability to sense oxygen and respond
to hypoxia (low oxygen states).
Mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) kinase inhibitors target
cancer cell growth.

4 Treating kidney cancer » Targeted therapy

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors

is everolimus (Afinitor). These mTOR kinase
inhibitors stop the cell from producing proteins
important to RCC and from receiving signals
to grow and divide. By blocking the action of
mTOR, these drugs slow tumor growth.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) block the
signals that cause kidney cancer to grow and
spread. Tyrosine kinases are proteins in cells
that are important for many cell functions.
This includes sending signals in cells for cell
growth, survival, and death. TKIs do not rid the
body of cancer. They stop cell growth.

Angiogenesis inhibitors
Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood
vessels. An angiogenesis inhibitor blocks this
growth. Kidney cancer cells are very good at
getting new blood vessels to grow into the
tumor to feed it. Kidney cancer cells release
high amounts of a protein called VEGF.

There are many different types of tyrosine
kinases. Each TKI works in a slightly different
way. Some tyrosine kinases, such as VEGFR,
send signals that tell new blood vessels
to grow into the tumor. Axitinib (Inlyta) and
tivozanib (Fotivda) block VEGFR. Some
TKIs target and block more than one type
of tyrosine kinase. These are called multikinase inhibitors. Many of the multi-kinase
inhibitors also block VEGF receptors. Sunitinib
(Sutent), pazopanib (Votrient), cabozantinib
(Cabometyx), erlotinib (Tarceva), and
lenvatinib (Lenvima) are multi-kinase inhibitors.

Bevacizumab (Avastin) and its substitutes
are a type of mAb called an angiogenesis
inhibitor. Bevacizumab stops VEGF from
sending signals that tell new blood vessels to
form. This slows or stops blood vessel growth
and starves the tumor. Although bevacizumab
targets tumor blood vessels, it can also affect
normal blood vessels. This can result in side
effects. A side effect is a problem caused by
treatment.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α
inhibitors

A biosimilar or substitute might be used in
place of bevacizumab. A biosimilar is an
almost identical version of a drug made by
another company. It is used in the exact same
way and at the same dose as bevacizumab.
Biosimilars include Vegzelma, Mvasi, Zirabev,
and Alymsys. Ask your care team why one
therapy might be chosen over another. The
reason might be related to tumor mutations,
cost, toxicity, or availability. Your wishes are
also important.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are
transcription factors that sense and respond to
low oxygen levels in normal and cancer cells.
Belzutifan is a HIF-2α inhibitor that interferes
with cancer cell’s ability to adapt to low oxygen
conditions.

mTOR kinase inhibitors
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a
protein in cells that is important for cell growth
and survival. mTOR moves chemicals, called
phosphates, from one molecule to another.
By transferring phosphates, mTOR sends
signals that tell cells to grow and divide. An
mTOR inhibitor blocks this signal. An example

4 Treating kidney cancer » Immunotherapy » Chemotherapy

Immunotherapy

Monoclonal antibody therapy
targeting immune checkpoints

Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment
that tries to re-activate the immune system
against tumor cells. The immune system
has many on and off switches. Tumors take
advantage of off switches. Immunotherapy
can be given alone or with other types of
treatment. It is used to treat stage 4 (with or
without metastases) kidney cancer or cancer
that has returned (relapsed). Sometimes, it is
used after surgery to prevent the cancer from
coming back.

Antibody therapy or immune checkpoint
inhibitory antibodies are used to help the
body fight cancer, infection, or other diseases.
Antibodies are proteins made by the immune
system that bind to specific markers on cells or
tissues. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a
type of antibody made in a lab.
There are 4 immunotherapy mAbs that are
approved to treat kidney cancer. All block
immune checkpoints and are referred to as
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

There are 2 types of immunotherapy used in
treating kidney cancer:




These include:

Monoclonal antibody therapy targeting
immune checkpoints—also known as
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)
Cytokine therapy (used only in certain
cases)

More information on checkpoint inhibitors and
immunotherapy side effects is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)



Nivolumab (Opdivo)



Ipilimumab (Yervoy)

Avelumab (Bavencio)

Cytokine therapy
Cytokines are proteins made by our immune
system. Some cytokines stimulate the immune
system and others slow it down. Interleukin (IL)
and interferon are types of cytokine therapy
made in a lab that are used only in rare cases
for cancer treatment.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is very effective for other types
of cancers but is rarely used in the treatment
of kidney cancer. It might be an option for
treatment of some rare forms of non-clear cell
RCC.

4 Treating kidney cancer » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, lab
tests, or general health. These requirements
ensure that participants are alike in specific
ways and that the trial is as safe as possible
for the participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.








Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a
study that you may be eligible for, ask your
treatment team if you meet the requirements.
If you have already started standard treatment
you may not be eligible for certain clinical
trials. Try not to be discouraged if you cannot
join. New clinical trials are always becoming
available.

Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Finding a clinical trial

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
It depends on the study, your health insurance,
and the state in which you live. In general,
procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered
standard of care will be billed to you or
your insurance, whereas those considered
research are covered by the trial sponsor. Your
treatment team and the research team can help
determine if you are responsible for any costs.

issues, and second cancers. The sooner late
effects are treated the better. Ask your care
team about what late effects could occur. This
will help you know what to look for.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to prevent,
reduce, and relieve suffering, and to improve
quality of life. Supportive care might include
pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual
support, financial aid, or family counseling. Tell
your care team how you are feeling and about
any side effects so they can be managed.
Supportive care, best supportive care, and
palliative care often mean the same thing.

Survivorship
A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment,
your health will be monitored for side effects of
treatment and the return of cancer. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important
to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.

A personalized survivorship care plan will
contain a summary of possible long-term
effects of treatment called late effects and list
follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care
provider will coordinate with specialists for your
follow-up care.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

Bone health
Kidney cancer may spread to your bones.
This puts your bones at increased risk for
injury and disease. Such problems include
bone fractures, bone pain, and squeezing
(compression) of the spinal cord. High levels
of calcium in the blood, called hypercalcemia,
may also occur.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

You may receive medicine to relieve bone
pain and manage low bone density. Some
medicines work by slowing or stopping
bone breakdown, while others help increase
bone thickness. It is recommended that you
take calcium and vitamin D with these bone
health medicines. Talk to your care team

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social health

supplements, vitamins, or medicines.

Bone metastases
Bone metastases might be treated with
palliative radiation therapy. Medicine to
support bone health and to prevent broken
bones might also be given.

All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. It is
important to tell your care team about all of
your side effects so they can be managed.

Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping problems
are common and are a normal part of
cancer diagnosis. Talk to your care team
and with those whom you feel most
comfortable about how you are feeling.
There are services, people, and medicine
that can help you. Support and counseling
services are available.

Supportive care resources
More information on supportive care is available
at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Fatigue
Fatigue is a state of physical or mental
tiredness that can be characterized by
a lack of energy, motivation, or stamina.
Fatigue may be caused by cancer or it
may be a side effect of treatment. Let your
care team know how you are feeling and
if fatigue is getting in the way of doing the
things you enjoy. Eating a balanced diet,
exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage
therapy can help. You might be referred to a
nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue.

4 Treating kidney cancer » General supportive care

Loss of appetite
Sometimes side effects from cancer or its
treatment, and the stress of having cancer
might cause you to feel not hungry or sick to
your stomach (nauseated). You might have a
sore mouth or difficulty swallowing. Healthy
eating is important during treatment. It includes
eating a balanced diet, eating the right
amount of food, and drinking enough fluids. A
registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition
and food can help. Speak to your care team if
you have trouble eating or maintaining weight.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

Nausea and vomiting

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

Pain
Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain. Some people may benefit from
palliative radiation therapy or ablation therapy
to help relieve pain. During this treatment, a
radiation beam is focused on the tumor.

heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care
medicines given during systemic therapy.
Therefore, it is very important to tell your
care team about any medicines, vitamins,
over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or
supplements you are taking.

Palliative care is appropriate
for anyone, regardless of age,
cancer stage, or the need for other
therapies. It focuses on physical,
emotional, social, and spiritual
needs that affect quality of life
(QOL).

Follow-up care includes regular physical
exams, health history, and blood, urine, and

you are having any symptoms or as needed.

After 5 years
Long-term follow-up care will include a
physical exam and health history. Other tests
including imaging, blood, and urine tests may
be ordered if you are having any symptoms.
The goal of care is to monitor kidney function
and watch for cancer return or metastatic
disease. Those with hereditary RCC will likely
need lifelong follow-up care.

Seek out support groups
at your local hospital,
through social media, or
through resources listed
in the back of this book.

This chapter discusses treatment

For metastatic disease, you might have
cytoreductive nephrectomy. In cytoreductive
nephrectomy, all or part of the kidney with
the tumor is removed. When there are
many metastases, it is not always possible
to remove them all. Removing the primary
tumor may improve how well other treatments
work against the remaining cancer and
metastases. A cytoreductive nephrectomy is
usually followed by targeted therapy and/or
immunotherapy. Systemic therapy options are
the same used to treat relapse disease found
in the section below.

options for stage 4 and relapsed
disease. Relapse is the return
of cancer. In metastatic disease,
cancer has spread to distant sites
in the body. Not all stage 4 kidney
cancers are metastatic. Together,
you and your care team will
choose a treatment plan that is
best for you.

Systemic therapy
If you did not have surgery, then a sample of
the tumor (biopsy) will be taken and tested to
determine if the cancer is a clear cell or nonclear cell subtype. Subtype affects treatment
options, which can be found in the next section
on Relapse.

Stage 4
In stage 4 kidney cancer, the tumor has grown
outside the kidney and Gerota’s fascia and/or
has spread to a distant site. Kidney cancer that
has spread to a distant site is called metastatic
renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Not all stage 4
kidney cancer is metastatic. Non-metastatic
stage 4 kidney cancer is called advanced
RCC.

Relapse
Recurrence or relapse is the return of cancer.
Prognostic risk factors help estimate the risk of
cancer recurrence and survival. These factors
include overall performance status (activity
level), blood counts, blood calcium and LDH
levels, and the time from primary surgery to
metastatic disease.

Treatment for stage 4 kidney cancer is based
on your symptoms. If there are metastases,
treatment will be based on the number and
location of metastases. A biopsy might be
taken of one or more of these metastases.



Surgery
If surgery is an option, then you might have a
nephrectomy followed by pembrolizumab or
surveillance. A clinical trial is an option for nonclear cell RCC.

If a person with metastatic RCC has no
risk factors, they are considered favorable
risk.
If a person has 1 to 2 risk factors, they are
considered intermediate risk.
Those with 3 or more risk factors are
considered poor risk.

6 Stage 4 and relapse » Relapse

Before starting treatment, a sample of your
tumor (biopsy) will be tested to determine
the subtype of RCC. When kidney cancer
cells form new tumors in other parts of the
body, it is referred to as metastatic disease. A
biopsy might be taken of one or more of these
metastases.

In stage 4 kidney cancer, the tumor has
grown outside the kidney and Gerota’s
fascia and/or has spread to a distant site.
Kidney cancer that has spread to a
distant site is called metastatic RCC
(mRCC). Not all stage 4 kidney cancer is
metastatic. Non-metastatic stage 4 kidney
cancer is called advanced RCC.
Treatment is based on your symptoms
and clear cell or non-clear cell subtype.
If there are metastases, treatment will
be based on the number and location of
metastases.
Follow-up testing will monitor for relapse
or disease progression.
Prognostic risk factors help estimate the
risk of cancer recurrence and survival.
These factors include overall performance
status (activity level), blood counts,
blood calcium and LDH levels, and the
time from primary surgery to metastatic
disease.
Supportive care is given to relieve the
symptoms of cancer or side effects of
cancer treatment.
Best supportive care aims to improve

Hereditary papillary renal
carcinoma

Malignant tumors without aggressive features
and early stage should undergo surgical
resection. A partial nephrectomy can be
considered. For larger tumors and those with
aggressive features (such as high grade or
sarcomatoid), radical nephrectomy should be
considered.

Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC)
increases the risk of a type of kidney cancer
known as papillary type 1 kidney cancer.
Mutations in the MET gene cause abnormal
cells to grow and spread in the body. Those
with HPRC have an increased risk of multiple
kidney tumors in one or both kidneys (also
called bilateral kidney tumors). Currently,
surgery is the primary method when a
localized tumor reaches greater than 3 cm in
size. When possible, a partial nephrectomy is
the treatment of choice. A person may have
multiple tumors during their lifetime and,
therefore, might have more than one surgery.
This will be taken into consideration when
planning treatment. Ablation is also an option.

Tuberous sclerosis complex
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is
characterized by the growth of numerous
noncancerous (benign) tumors in many parts
of the body. These tumors can occur in the
skin, brain, kidneys, and other organs. Almost
everyone with TSC has skin abnormalities.
Kidney tumors are common in those with TSC.
Partial nephrectomy is the treatment of choice
for malignant (cancerous) kidney tumors, when
possible. Ablation is also an option.

Hereditary paragangliomapheochromocytoma syndrome

Renal angiomyolipoma is a benign lesion
associated with TSC and is managed
separately.

Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma
(PGL/PCC) syndromes are characterized by
paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas.




Everolimus is an FDA-approved therapy for
asymptomatic, growing angiomyolipoma
measuring larger than 3 cm in diameter.

Paragangliomas are tumors that arise
from neuroendocrine tissues found along
the spine from the base of the skull to the
pelvis.

Von Hippel-Lindau
In von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a
mutation in the VHL gene causes tumors and
cysts to grow in certain areas of the body
and increases the chance of developing
kidney cancer and other cancers. The goal of
treatment is to intervene at a time when there
will be the most benefit and to limit the chance
of developing metastatic disease. You should
be referred to a hospital or cancer center
with surgical expertise in complex partial
nephrectomies and management of VHL.

Pheochromocytomas are a type
of paraganglioma that is confined to
the adrenal gland, a small hormoneproducing organ located on top of each
kidney.

Paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas
can occur in individuals with other inherited
disorders, such as von Hippel-Lindau
syndrome.

in size. A person may have multiple tumors
during their lifetime and, therefore, might have
more than one surgery. This will be taken

Ablation may be an option if surgery is not

the treatment of VHL disease-related renal
cell carcinomas, hemangioblastomas, and
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and can
be considered as an alternative to surgery
if surgery can wait. Pazopanib might be an

Your preferences about
treatment are always

57

Kidney cancer related to an inherited
syndrome is called hereditary renal cell
carcinoma (HRCC). There are several
conditions that cause HRCC.
Those who have HRCC should see their
doctors often, especially if they have
already been diagnosed with RCC.
Regular imaging tests will look for new
kidney tumors.
Most with confirmed HRCC are treated
with kidney-sparing surgery (partial
nephrectomy). Other options might
include ablation or systemic therapy,
depending on the type of HRCC. Seek
treatment with a doctor or hospital that is
experienced in your type of HRCC.
