About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Smoking Cessation, Version 1.2024 – April 30, 2024.

Why smoking is so
addictive

By reading this guideline, you’re
flipping the page to your next
chapter. The one where you take a

Smoking is not just a habit — it’s an addiction.
And behind that addiction is nicotine, a highly
addictive chemical compound. Nicotine
exists in nearly all tobacco products including
cigarettes, cigars, hookah tobacco, smokeless
tobacco, and most electronic cigarettes
(e-cigarettes). These products are designed to
deliver nicotine to your brain quickly.

solid step forward to finally being
done with smoking and getting
healthier. Good for you!

This book will show you how to quit smoking
with recommendations backed by research
and experts.

As nicotine stimulates parts of your brain over
and over, your brain gets used to having it.
And in time, your brain changes in response to
nicotine. It craves nicotine just to feel normal.
So, you grab that cigarette.

First, it’s important to know how smoking or
using tobacco products affects your body
because it will help you better understand
the recommendations. While the following
advice will help you quit smoking and the term
“smoking” is used throughout, it applies to
quitting all tobacco products.

When you start the quit process, your brain
and body get confused. You may start to feel
anxious when you don’t get nicotine. It might
be hard to concentrate or to sleep. And you

Quitting isn't easy but it
is possible. Some people
try a dozen or more
times before they quit
smoking for good.

withdrawal — more on that in Chapter 2: The
benefits of quitting.

to infections, as well as heart and lung issues.
And after surgery, you might have a longer
hospital stay.

While nicotine is responsible for the addictive
side of smoking, it is the hundreds of other
chemicals in tobacco that can cause health
problems.

But doing the opposite: quitting smoking
can help make you healthier. Read the next
chapter for exactly how.

Effects on cancer treatment
If you have cancer or you’re a survivor,
smoking carries additional health risks. For
one, smoking interferes with your body’s
response to cancer medicine. That means you
could have a poorer treatment response with
medicines like systemic therapies, targeted
therapies, as well as with radiation therapy.
Smoking while having cancer is also known to
raise your risk for:


A second primary cancer



A cancer recurrence



More harmful effects of your treatment
(known as toxicity)

Effects on surgery
Smoking can also make surgery more
complicated. It can contribute to a decrease in
quality of life after surgery. For example, you
might have more fatigue, more pain, or more
shortness of breath (called dyspnea) than
someone who doesn’t smoke with cancer.
You might have more trouble healing from
surgery. Smoking also makes you more prone

over withdrawal. But you can do it.

When you discuss the advantages of quitting,
it’s not fair to do so without mentioning a
disadvantage: withdrawal. During the quit
process, you’ll likely be faced with withdrawal
symptoms, which can be tough. If you’ve tried
to quit before or know someone who has, you
know that’s one of the reasons it’s so hard to
quit completely.

Aside from the cravings, you might have
trouble concentrating or have a tough time
falling asleep. Some other common withdrawal
symptoms include feeling:

It’s important to know that nicotine withdrawal
cannot hurt you and over time, it will get easier.
The good news is it will get better with each
day as your brain readjusts to not having it.

Withdrawal happens because you stop using
products with nicotine. When the chemical
compound is no longer there, your brain and
body have to get used to not having it. So the
brain craves nicotine and can make you feel
overall unwell at first. It’s normal to feel that

biggest challenge with quitting
is withdrawal. But there are ways

Nicotine replacement

to make it easier. Read on for
more information on the types of
treatment available to help you quit.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is
designed to help with withdrawal symptoms.
Most NRT products are readily available
over the counter (no prescription needed).
NRTs work by replacing some of the nicotine
you’d get from cigarettes, so you don’t feel as
uncomfortable quitting.

As mentioned in the last chapter, withdrawal
can be tough. But you can talk to and get
help from your health care professional who
might recommend the following products and
strategies. Keep in mind that these products
and strategies can be used on their own or in
combination to help with your mind and your
body’s response to withdrawal.

The nicotine in NRTs has proven to be safe
and effective to use to help you quit. It’s
important to know that NRTs do not cause
death and diseases like cigarettes do. Most
of the dangers of smoking are because of the
hundreds of toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke
— not nicotine.

The good news is most health insurance plans
cover FDA-approved quit-smoking medicines,
including over-the-counter medicines. Read
Chapter 4: How to quit for more information on

Using nicotine
replacement therapy
(NRT) like the nicotine
patch can be very
effective at helping
you quit smoking.

3 Treatment options » Nicotine replacement therapy

Side effects

The way they work: You slowly reduce the use
of the NRT in order to decrease the amount of
nicotine you take in.

You might experience side effects with NRTs
but usually they’re mild, such as skin rash with
the patch or upset stomach with the gum or
lozenge. You do not usually need to stop a
medicine because of a minor side effect. Talk
to your health care professional if side effects
are more severe for you.

NRT products include the nicotine patch,
nicotine lozenge, nicotine gum, and nicotine
nasal spray. See Guide 1 for a description
of quit smoking aids.

Types of quit-smoking aids

Over-the-counter
nicotine replacement
therapies (NRTs)

• Skin patches (also called transdermal nicotine patches): These
patches stick to your skin much like adhesive bandages. They are
considered long-acting NRTs.
• Gum (also called nicotine gum): You have to follow the directions for
this type of gum to be effective. It's not chewed like regular gum.
• Lozenges (also called nicotine lozenges): These look like hard
candy and dissolve in your mouth.

Nicotine prescription
medicine

• Nicotine spray: This is a handheld spray bottle that you spray in
each nostril.

Non-nicotine
prescription medicines

Two FDA-approved quit-smoking products that are in pill form and do
not contain nicotine:
• Varenicline
• Bupropion

dreams and sleep disturbances. Talk with your
health care professional about side effects
because there can be ways around them. For
example, it may be that taking the medicine
with food, making dietary changes, or avoiding
taking the medicine before bed will help
ease those side effects. Changes in mood or
behavior can also be side effects but they're
rare.

Other options to help you quit are FDAapproved, non-nicotine medicines, but you
must work with a health care professional and
get a prescription. After an overview of your
tobacco use (current or past), quit attempts,
and if you used anything to help you quit in
the past, your health care professional might
suggest a non-nicotine medicine to help you.

Remember to talk to your health care
professional right away if you experience
potential side effects.

There are two approved non-nicotine medicines
used to help people quit smoking: varenicline
(formerly known as Chantix) and bupropion
(known as Wellbutrin or Zyban). Because these
medicines don’t contain nicotine, they help you
stop smoking in other ways — by lessening
your brain’s urge to smoke.

Bupropion
Bupropion may be a good choice for people
who have tried using other quit-smoking
medicines but haven’t been able to quit
successfully. Bupropion is a pill that you
take twice a day. Start taking it 1 to 2 weeks
before quitting. It can be combined with NRTs
but must be discussed with your health care
professional first.

You usually have to take the medicine for 12
weeks or longer. Talk openly and honestly
with your health care professional about any
concerns you have so you both can find the
right medicine for you.

Side effects
Like varenicline, bupropion can have side
effects. Some of the most common are nausea
or dizziness, trouble sleeping, constipation, dry
mouth, and rash (stop taking if you develop a
rash).

Varenicline
Varenicline is a pill that works by attaching
to the same parts of your brain that are
stimulated by nicotine. This means that
nicotine from a cigarette has fewer places to
attach because the varenicline is already there
and reduces the urge to smoke. For it to work
properly, you have to start this medicine a
week before you quit. It can be combined with
NRTs but must be done under a health care
professional’s supervision.

Talk to your health care professional about
the side effects. There are ways to deal
with them like taking bupropion with food to
combat nausea, taking it in the late afternoon
to combat sleep issues, and drinking plenty of
water to help with constipation and dry mouth.

Side effects
Varenicline can have side effects. Some of
the most common are nausea or vomiting,
constipation and flatulence, and strange

This book uses the term health care
professional to describe the person who
can provide or prescribe behavior therapy
or medicine to help you quit smoking.

Behavior therapy, FDA-approved
medicines, and nicotine-replacement
therapies (NRTs) can make quitting
easier.
Most NRTs can be bought without a
prescription.

Behavior therapy can be useful on its own
or in combination with NRTs and nonnicotine medicines.

Fortunately, there are many types
of health care professionals who
can help you quit. This may be your
primary care doctor, your oncologist,
your pulmonologist, a mental health
professional, a tobacco treatment
specialist, or a quitting counselor.

Behavior therapy can include counseling
from an individual or group or even free
web-based programs, quit lines, or apps.

You may even meet with several people
who can help you with different aspects
of quitting.

Non-nicotine medicines require a
prescription from your health care
professional.

You are not alone!

NRTs can have side effects but they’re
usually mild.

While non-nicotine medicines can be
very effective in helping you quit, talk to
your health professional about their side
effects — many can be managed.

Questions you might be asked
Your health care professional may ask you questions like these
to help you come up with a plan to quit.

About your tobacco use

• How much do you currently smoke or use tobacco products
(cigarettes, pipes, cigars, hookah, cigarillos, e-cigarettes/vaping,
smokeless tobacco) per day?
• What is the typical amount?
• How soon do you smoke or use tobacco products after you wake
up in the morning?

About your previous
quit attempts

• What is the longest period you have gone without smoking?
• Which strategies worked?
• Which strategies didn’t work and why? (side effects, cost,
continued cravings, not enough behavioral support)
• When was your last quit attempt?

What you used to help

Your health care professional will also ask
about your previous quit attempts and what
you’ve used to help you in the past. And
they’ll recommend your family members
stop smoking because of the added health
concerns of secondhand smoke. Not having
other people who use tobacco in the house
makes it easier for you to quit and stay that
way, too.

If you’ve already quit and it happened
within the past 30 days (when slips and
relapses are most likely), your health care
professional will encourage you to keep going
but also evaluate you for the risk of a slip or
relapse. If it’s been more than 30 days since
you smoked, you will also be assessed for
relapse. For more information, see Chapter 5:
Slips and relapses.
If you’re still not ready to quit, that’s
okay. Your health care professional might want
to find out what is keeping you from quitting.
They might recommend that you take nonnicotine medicines or nicotine replacement
therapy (NRT) with a goal of reducing your
smoking in the meantime. Then, you can set a
quit date for the future.

Ready to quit?
If you feel ready to quit, your health care
professional may encourage you to set a
quit date. At that time, they will tell you your
options for treatment (mentioned in Chapter 3:
Treatment options). They may also encourage
you to quit as soon as possible, especially
if cancer surgery is planned. The longer the
time between quitting smoking and surgery,
the better. It will help you in recovering from
surgery.

Just be aware that smoking less is not
as helpful as quitting smoking completely
because you’re still exposed to tobacco and its
chemicals. Yet any bit less can help. At each
visit, your health care professional will likely
encourage you to quit to help you have better
cancer treatment results.

Working closely
with your health
care professional
can give you
the support that
you might need
in becoming
smokefree.

4 How to quit » What’s recommended

What’s recommended

Or your health care professional may
recommend behavior therapy plus varenicline
for 12 weeks (at which time you’ll check in with
them).

Quitting tends to be more successful when
backed up with behavior therapy. Longer, more
frequent sessions with trained counselors
make it more likely you will succeed in your
quit attempt. So, your health care professional
might suggest at least 4 or more sessions of
individual or group therapy.

Follow up
Within the first 3 weeks of quitting, your health
care professional may ask you to check in to
see how you’re doing. Then at your 12-week
check-in, your health care professional might
adjust the frequency of behavior therapy or the
medicine dosage.

And what can be even more effective is
combining behavior therapy with NRTs or
non-nicotine medicines. See Guide 3 for
different treatments.

If you’re smokefree at that point (doing
well with quitting and not needing more
assistance), your health care professional
might suggest continuing taking the medicine
for 6 months or longer. And you will be asked
to check in 6 months and 12 months after you
started your quit attempt.

Your health care professional may recommend
behavior therapy along with what’s called
combination NRT for 12 weeks (at which time
you’ll check in with them). Combination NRT
adds a long-acting NRT like the nicotine patch
and a short-acting NRT like the lozenge, gum,
or nasal spray.

What’s not recommended
Remember that even if you think you can’t
quit after one or two (or more) attempts, it
doesn’t mean you can’t keep trying to quit
and eventually succeed. You — like so many
others who use tobacco — just might need the
right combination of recommended options
(non-nicotine medicines, NRT, and behavior
therapy) to keep you smokefree.

Also known as vapes, they are often called
e-cigs, vape pens, and electronic nicotine
delivery systems (ENDS).
You might have heard using e-cigarettes (or
vaping) is less harmful than smoking traditional
cigarettes. While e-cigarettes typically have
fewer chemicals than regular cigarettes,
they may still contain toxic heavy metals like
lead, flavorings linked to lung disease, small
particles that can be inhaled deep into the
lungs, and cancer-causing chemicals.

Alternative methods
Still, some people will turn to other ways of
quitting like hypnosis, acupuncture, or nutritional
supplements. While these alternatives might
work for some people, your health care
professional won’t likely recommend them
because there isn’t as much research to show
they work for quitting smoking.

And it’s important to realize that e-cigarettes
still include the addictive chemical compound
of nicotine.
Not FDA-approved
Some people switch to e-cigarettes as a way
to stop smoking traditional cigarettes, thinking
they’re a healthier alternative. But there’s just
not enough evidence to recommend them as
a quit-smoking aid. For example, the FDA has
not approved them as a smoking treatment.

E-cigarettes
Another method some people try to help
them stop smoking is electronic cigarettes
(e-cigarettes). Most e-cigarettes contain
nicotine but not tobacco. Because nicotine
is derived from tobacco, the FDA classifies
e-cigarettes as tobacco products.

Still, if you do quit smoking traditional
cigarettes and e-cigarettes are helping
you do that, your health care professional
should support you. But they may eventually
encourage you to stop using e-cigarettes, too,
and instead use FDA-approved methods of
NRTs, behavior therapy, and/or non-nicotine
medicines to quit them.

What are they?
E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices
that heat a liquid and produce an aerosol. An
aerosol is a mix of small particles released
in the air. Some people refer to the aerosol
from an e-cigarette as vapor but it is not water
vapor.

4 How to quit » Key points

“

Bottom line
It’s best to quit smoking completely than to
switch to vaping. Based on the unknown
risks of using e-cigarettes, your health care
professional will likely encourage you to quit
all smoking. It’s equally not a good idea to add
e-cigarettes to traditional cigarettes (called
dual use) because it poses additional risks for
cancer and other smoking-related diseases.

I grew up smoking. Our heroes
smoked. After 50 years of smoking,
I quit during my cancer treatment.
I quit, hoping it may help.”

Quitting smoking is easier with support
from your care team.
Quitting can be more successful when
behavior therapy is used — alone or in
combination with NRTs and non-nicotine
medicines.
Combination NRT is using a long-acting
NRT (nicotine patch) with a short-acting
NRT (lozenge, gum, inhaler, or nasal
spray).
You might just need the right combination
of recommended options to quit for good.
Your health care professional will want
to check in with you at 3 weeks and then
again at 12 weeks after quitting.
Some people switch to e-cigarettes, but
they’re not FDA-approved as a smoking
treatment.
It’s best for your health to quit smoking
completely rather than switching to
e-cigarettes.

5 Slips and relapses » Risk factors for relapse

In your attempt to quit, you might

Two key risk factors for relapse are:

experience a slip or a relapse,



which is not unusual. Keep trying!
It’s worth it. Read on for what to



do if either of those happen.

You quit smoking less than a year ago
(and especially less than 30 days ago)
You start smoking within 30 minutes of
waking up each day

But there are other risk factors.

See Guide 4.

If you tried quitting but started smoking again
soon after, that’s okay. It’s called a slip. They
tend to be most common within the first three
months of quitting. But slips can happen at any
time.

Guide 4
Risk factors for smoking relapse

If you’ve quit for a longer period but started
smoking regularly again, that’s called a
relapse.

Frequent or intense cravings
Elevated anxiety, stress, or depression

Slips and relapses are both common.
Just about everyone who has tried to quit
experience them. A slip doesn’t mean you’ll
start smoking again. And a relapse doesn’t
mean you’re back to smoking for the rest of
your life. You can still quit smoking for good.
Try quitting again as soon as you can.

Mental health issues (current or past)
Chronic or uncontrolled pain
Living or working with someone who uses
tobacco
Quitting less than 1 year ago

Each time you try, think of slips and relapses
as small and medium-size bumps in the
road of the journey to your destination: being
smokefree. Keep going!

Recent quit attempt (starting NRT or nonnicotine medicine)
Drug (cannabis, opioids, stimulants) and
alcohol use

Risk factors for relapse

Low self-confidence in ability to quit or stay
that way

Your health care professional will likely talk
with you about slips and relapses as well as
your risk factors for them. Risk factors are
what make you more likely to have a slip or
relapse.

Recent history of smoking 20 or more
cigarettes per day

5 Slips and relapses » Treatment for relapse and sustained smoking

Treatment for relapse and
sustained smoking

If you have more than one risk factor, your
health care professional will likely recommend
behavior therapy that focuses on relapse,
as well as combination nicotine replacement
therapies (NRTs), or non-nicotine medicines.
They might also offer more resources for
support such as a referral to a mental
health specialist if you need help with stress
management.

But if after your first visit, you relapse after
quitting or you still have not yet quit (called
sustained smoking), your health care
professional will encourage you to try the firstrecommended (primary) treatment.
Your health care professional might also ask
about any side effects from the treatments
or any other obstacles in your way. At that
point, you might need to try something new.
For example, if you used combination NRT
only, then you might try varenicline. A different
behavior therapy might also be recommended.
For more options, see Chapter 4: How to quit.

More information about stress management
can be found in NCCN Guidelines for Patients:
Distress During Cancer Care, available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

After switching the therapy or making medicine
adjustments, your health care professional will
want you to check in within 3 weeks and then
again after 12 weeks of treatment.
Your health care professional will continue
discussing your smoking status and risk of
relapse at each visit.

If at that time you’re smokefree, then you might
continue your medicine for 6 months or longer.
You will be asked to check in at the end of 6
months and again at 12 months to see how
you’re doing.

If you have no risk factors for relapse, then you
will likely be encouraged at each visit to keep
going with your quit attempt. Your health care
professional might extend the duration of your
treatment to make sure you stay smokefree,
possibly 6 months or longer. They also might
assess smoking status at the end of treatment,
and again after another 6 to 12 months.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Quitting Smoking, 2024

If you relapse again or are still not ready
to quit, your health care professional might
recommend more behavior therapy and
another medicine (NRT or non-nicotine
medicine). For example, if you were on
combination NRT only, then maybe add
varenicline or bupropion.

“

Quitting smoking can be more like a marathon
than a sprint. Give yourself a break. You
can — and should — try again. You and your
health are worth it!

Never give up. Fight a good fight.
Keep the faith and believe you will
conquer this. You are not alone.”

you might be ready tomorrow and can be
successful with help.
Your health care professional might ask
questions to find out why you’re having
trouble quitting.
A new behavior therapy might be added
or you might switch to a different NRT or
non-nicotine medicine to help you quit.

6 Making treatment decisions » It’s your choice » Questions to ask

It’s important to be comfortable

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments. Weigh options and share
concerns with your care team. If you can
build a relationship with your team, you’ll feel
supported when considering options and
making treatment decisions.

with the treatment you choose.
This choice starts with having an
open and honest conversation
with your care team.

Support groups
Many people find support groups to be helpful.
If your hospital or community doesn’t have
support groups for quitting smoking, check out
the websites listed in this book.

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your team.

Questions to ask
Possible questions to ask your care team are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these or come up with your own. Be clear
about your goals for treatment and find out
what to expect from treatment.

Treatment decisions are very personal. What’s
important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about side effects






Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life
How active you are and the activities that
are important to you
