Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology, Version
1.2023 – June 29, 2022.

About AYAs
An adolescent and young adult (AYA) with
cancer is someone 15 to 39 years of age
at the time of initial cancer diagnosis. AYAs
with cancer have unique medical, mental,
emotional, and social concerns. This
combination of mental, emotional, social, and
spiritual aspects is referred to as psychosocial
support. Some of the psychosocial effects
of cancer are changes in how a person
thinks, their feelings, moods, beliefs, ways of
coping, and relationships with family, friends,
and co-workers. There are different kinds of
psychosocial support, including counseling,
education, group support, and spiritual support

AYAs with cancer have unique medical,
mental, emotional, and social concerns.

AYAs with cancer have specific age-related
challenges and concerns such as:

AYA cancer treatment
AYAs develop different types of cancer than
other age groups. These cancers look and
behave differently than the same cancers in
younger children and older adults. Therefore,
AYA cancer treatment is complex. AYA bodies
are still going through physical and hormonal
changes. These changes affect how cancer
develops and how the cancer responds to
treatment. Both the type of cancer you have
and the age at which you were diagnosed
play a role in how your cancer will be treated.
And, treatment options will vary based on your
unique needs.

Fertility (all genders) » Understanding the risks » Fertility

Treatment can impact fertility

Your care team should be able to explain
whether your cancer and/or cancer treatment
puts your fertility at risk, and if so, how high
of a risk. While it is your treatment team’s
responsibility to discuss this with you, it is
important that you advocate for yourself and
ask about fertility risk.

or the ability to have children.
Therefore, it is recommended you
consider fertility preservation
before starting treatment. This
chapter offers more information

Discuss with your care team and a fertility
specialist what can be done to:

about fertility risks and steps you
can take to preserve your fertility.



Understanding the risks





If you think you want children in the future,
ask your care team how cancer and cancer
treatment might change your fertility. In order
to preserve your fertility, you may need to take
action before starting cancer treatment. Those
who want to have children in the future should
be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the
options before starting treatment.

Examples of treatments that affect the
reproductive system include:



Protect your fertility so you have the
choice to plan a pregnancy in the future

Some types of fertility preservation take a
couple of days, and some types can take
about two and half weeks. Talk to your care
team about the risks of delaying treatment and
any concerns you may have. Together, you
and your care will decide the timing of fertility
preservation.

Some cancer treatments can harm the
reproductive system and affect the ability to
have children. The impact on fertility depends
on the location of the cancer that will be
treated, the type of treatment, and the intensity
or combination of drugs. The reproductive
system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes,
uterus, cervix, vagina, prostate, testes, and
penis, and even specific parts of the brain.

Changes in fertility

Oncofertility team

Treatment might cause your fertility to be
interrupted or impaired. This loss can be
temporary or permanent and is related to your
age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s),
treatment dose, and treatment length.




The oncofertility team focuses on endocrine
(hormone) health and fertility options of
someone with cancer before and after
treatment. Fertility preservation is all about
keeping your options open, whether you know
you want to have children later in life or aren’t
really sure at the moment. Reproductive
specialists and the members of an oncofertility
team can help you sort through what may work
for you. Often, cancer centers that specialize in
treating AYAs also have oncofertility teams or
reproductive specialists.

In those assigned male at birth,
sometimes the testicles can no longer
make sperm (a condition known as
azoospermia) or the pathways that sperm
travel through get blocked or damaged.
In those assigned female at birth,
sometimes the ovaries no longer release
eggs, a condition called premature
ovarian failure or early menopause. When
there is damage to the uterus or other
parts of the reproductive system, it can
prevent the eggs from getting fertilized
or fertilized eggs from implanting and
growing inside the uterus.

Depending on the type of cancer and the
specialists available in your area, your
oncofertility team may include:

Your oncology care team should
start the conversation about cancerrelated changes in fertility and help you
understand the risks.
A nurse navigator or case manager
will help you navigate the referral process,
coordinate the various specialists involved
in your care, and deal with the insurance
company.
An endocrinologist and fertility/
reproductive specialist can explain
your fertility preservation options,
including how it is done, success rates,
timing, and costs. This specialist might
carry out the fertility-sparing procedure.
A genetics counselor can assess your
risk of passing on genetic abnormalities to
your children. This is usually done within
the first 2 months of starting treatment.

A gynecologist or urologist can
assess your risk of altered fertility and
guide you in addressing your fertility
needs.
A gynecologic or urologic
oncologist specializes in cancers of
the reproductive and urinary tract organs.
This is usually a surgeon and may be the
one to perform fertility-sparing surgery.

What should I consider?
Before you decide how, or if, to preserve
your fertility, think about your answer to
the following questions:

A family-planning specialist can
offer information about many different
options for becoming a parent.

3 How do you feel about having
children in the future?

An adoption professional can
provide information and counseling on the
process of becoming an adoptive parent.
This can include criteria, timing, and
costs.

3 Have you always wanted children?
3 How many children do you want to
have? When?

3 How would you feel about having a

surrogate carry and give birth to your
child?

Out-of-pocket costs

3 Do you have any religious or moral

Often, insurance does not cover fertility
preservation services. This means there are
out-of-pocket costs. However, your cancer
team or fertility specialists should be able to
discuss the cost to fertility preservation and
what discounts might be available for those
with cancer.

concerns about technologies such as
in vitro fertilization (IVF) or embryo
transplantation?

All fertility preservation methods have
an out-of-pocket cost. Check with your
insurance company about which fertility
preservation methods are covered and
what your out-of-pocket costs might be.

Fertility (all genders) » Preserving fertility before treatment

Preserving fertility before
treatment

Banking healthy cells
Below is a list of proven and reliable methods
for fertility preservation.

Your fertility preservation options will vary
depending on your age, gender/sex assigned
at birth, and type of cancer you have. Most
techniques that can increase your chances
of having children in the future must be done
before starting cancer treatment. Fertility
preservation involves techniques that prevent
damage and remove healthy cells (sperm,
eggs, or embryos) and store them for later use.
Fertility preservation options can be found in
Guide 1.





Damage prevention
Below are options used to prevent damage to
the ovaries.




Fertility-sparing surgery – The
reproductive organs can be protected
through fertility-sparing surgery. The
surgeon removes only the cancerous
tissue leaving as much healthy tissue
in place as possible. For example, the
surgeon could leave the healthy ovary
in place if you have early-stage ovarian
cancer. In radiation therapy, a special
shield made of lead is used to prevent
radiation from damaging the ovaries or
testicles.





Ovarian transposition
(oophoropexy) – This method can
prevent damage to the ovaries during
radiation therapy. A surgeon will move
the healthy ovary (or ovaries) out of the
radiation field and attach it to the wall
of your abdomen. An oophoropexy is a
proven option to preserve fertility.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer, 2023



12

Egg freezing (oocyte
cryopreservation) – This procedure
uses hormone shots, which may delay
treatment, to make the ovaries produce
multiple eggs. These eggs are removed
and frozen, but not fertilized. This process
usually takes about two and half weeks.
Embryo freezing (embryo
cryopreservation) after in vitro
fertilization (IVF) – In this process,
eggs are removed from the ovaries and
fertilized with sperm in a lab. The embryo
is then frozen. IVF can be done using
a sperm donor. IVF involves a series of
hormone shots to prompt the ovaries to
produce more than one egg. This process
usually takes about two and half weeks.
Ovarian tissue freezing
(cryopreservation) – The surgical
removal and freezing of a healthy
ovary (or part of an ovary). After cancer
treatment, the tissue is put back into the
body.
Sperm banking (sperm
cryopreservation) – This procedure
collects and freezes one or more samples
of ejaculate (semen). Sperm banking kits
can be ordered online or you can make
an appointment at a local urology office.
Testicular sperm extraction – This
is the removal of a sperm from the testicle
while under local anesthesia (a controlled
loss of feeling in a small area of the body
from drugs). Sperm cells are then frozen.

Fertility (all genders) » Preserving fertility before treatment

Other options
The option below might not be available or
appropriate for you.


Testicular tissue freezing
(cryopreservation) – The surgical
removal of a small portion of tissue from
the testicle. The tissue is frozen to make
sperm from it later.

Guide 1
Fertility preservation options
Egg freezing (oocyte
cryopreservation)

A process in which eggs are removed from the ovaries and
frozen.

Embryo freezing (embryo
cryopreservation) after in
vitro fertilization (IVF)

A process in which eggs are removed from the ovaries and
fertilized by sperm in a lab to create an embryo. The embryo is
frozen.

Ovarian transposition
(oophoropexy)

A surgeon will move the healthy ovary (or ovaries) out of the
radiation field and attach it to the wall of your abdomen.

Ovarian tissue freezing
(cyropreservation)

A surgeon removes the ovary or part of it and freezes it. After
cancer treatment, the ovary or tissue is put back. This option is
not always available.

Sperm banking (sperm
cryopreservation)

A procedure that collects and freezes one or more samples of
semen. Sperm banking kits can be ordered online or you can
make an appointment at a local urology office.

Testicular sperm extraction

A surgeon removes sperm cells directly from the testicle. The
sperm cells are frozen.

Testicular tissue freezing
(cryopreservation)

A surgeon removes a small portion of tissue from the testicle and
freezes it to try to make sperm from it later. This option is not
always available.

Fertility (all genders) » Fertility after treatment

Fertility after treatment



A follow-up with a fertility specialist after
treatment may be helpful. If you noticed
changes in your fertility, then consider the
following possible options:




Donor eggs or embryos – Donor eggs
are removed from someone other than
you. The donor goes through hormone
treatment to produce multiple eggs.
Donor eggs are fertilized through IVF
using sperm chosen by you. Some people
donate their frozen embryos for someone
else to use.
Adoption or fostering – Some
adoption agencies may require that
you be cancer-free (in remission) and
off treatment for a certain amount of
time before adopting a child. You could
also become a foster parent. For more
information, consider state, national, and
federal organizations like
ChildWelfare.gov or AdoptUsKids.org.

Those who want to have
children in the future
should be referred to
a fertility specialist to
discuss the options
before starting treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer, 2023

14

Surrogate pregnancy – In a surrogate
pregnancy, a frozen embryo is created
from the egg and sperm from you and
a designated partner. The embryo is
implanted in the uterus of a surrogate
chosen by you, who carries the baby until
birth. Often, there is a legal agreement
between the person who will become
pregnant and the future parent(s).

Fertility (all genders) » Preventing pregnancy during treatment

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment

recommended during and after treatment.
Consult your care team for the best time to
plan a pregnancy.

Avoiding pregnancy during cancer therapy
is very important. Becoming pregnant, or
having your partner becoming pregnant during
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other
types of systemic therapy may lead to serious
birth defects. Because, cancer and cancer
treatment can affect the ovaries and damage
sperm.

Blood clots
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) refers to
blood clots in the veins. If you are at risk of
VTE, your care team will recommend specific
contraceptive methods.

Those with testicles

Hormonal birth control may or may not
be recommended, so ask your care team
about intrauterine devices (IUDs), condoms,
diaphragms, cervical caps, and the
contraceptive sponge.

Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Sperm counts can return a few
years after treatment is completed. Use
contraception (birth control) such as condoms
to prevent pregnancy during and immediately
after cancer treatment.

Speak to your care team about preventing
pregnancy while being treated for cancer.
Those who want to become pregnant in
the future should be referred to a fertility
specialist to discuss the options before starting
treatment.

Those with ovaries
Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing
baby if you are or become pregnant during
treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding at the time of your cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.
Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
“period” may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those

Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and
treat cancer. Results from imaging studies
and biopsies will be used to determine your
treatment plan. It is important you understand
what these tests mean. Ask questions and
keep copies of your test results. Online patient
portals are a great way to access your test
results.

Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.
Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP. They are
great partners in care.
Include in your contact list information on
the exact subtype of cancer, as well as
any treatment and the date it started.

Keep these things in mind:

Testing and treatment » Genetic and genetic risk testing

Genetic and genetic risk
testing
You might be thinking why did I get cancer?
Most of the time, the answer is one cell made
a mistake when dividing and then a cancer
formed. Some, however, have a predisposition
or have something in their DNA (genetic
material) that makes them more likely to
develop cancer. AYAs are more likely to have
a cancer predisposition condition than older
adults with cancer. Understanding whether
you have a cancer predisposition condition
can sometimes affect your cancer treatment,
but more often, it can affect screening for
other cancers. Therefore, identifying a cancer
predisposition condition is important.

Create a medical binder
A medical binder or notebook is a great way
to organize all of your records in one place.

3 Make copies of blood tests, imaging

results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

3 Choose a binder that meets your

needs. Consider a zipper pocket to
include a pen, small calendar, and
insurance cards.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup). The goal is to look for
gene mutations inherited from your biological
parents called germline mutations. Some
mutations can put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. You can pass these genes
on to your children. Also, family members
might carry these mutations. Tell your care
team if there is a family history of cancer.

3 Create folders for insurance forms,

test types (blood, imaging, pathology,
radiology, genetics), treatments, and
procedures. Organize items in the
folder by date.

3 Use online patient portals to view

A genetic risk assessment will identify if you
carry a cancer risk and if you may benefit
from genetic testing, additional screening, or
preventive interventions. Depending on the
genetic risk assessment, you might undergo
genetic testing and genetic counseling.

Testing and treatment » Biomarker testing

Biomarker testing

What is your family
health history?

Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of
46 chromosomes. Each chromosome contains
thousands of genes. Genes are coded
instructions for the proteins your cells make. A
mutation is when something goes wrong in the
genetic code.

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families – those who are related to you
through genes passed down from parent
to child. This information is called a family
health history. You can ask family members
about their health issues like heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they
were diagnosed. For relatives who have
died, ask about the cause and age of death.

A sample from your biopsy will undergo lab
tests to look for specific DNA mutations/
alterations, protein levels, or other molecular
features. This information is used to learn
more about your type of cancer and to choose
the best treatment for you. It is sometimes
called molecular testing, tumor profiling, gene
expression profiling, or genomic testing.

Start by asking your parents, siblings,
and children. Next, talk to half-siblings,
aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews,
grandparents, and grandchildren.
Write down what you learn about your
family history and share with your health
care provider.

Biomarker testing includes tests of genes
or their products (proteins). It identifies the

Some of the questions to ask include:

20

•

Do you have any chronic diseases, such
as heart disease or diabetes, or health
conditions such as high blood pressure
or high cholesterol?

•

Have you had any other diseases, such
as cancer or stroke?

•

How old were you when each of these
diseases and health conditions was
diagnosed?

•

What is our family’s ancestry – from
what countries did our ancestors
originate?

Testing and treatment » Care team

Care team



Treating cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT
is a team of doctors, nurses, health care
providers, and psychosocial professionals from
different professional backgrounds who have
knowledge (expertise) and experience in AYAs
with your type of cancer. This team is united
in the planning and implementing of your
treatment. Ask who will coordinate your care.





Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout cancer treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it. Get to know
your care team and help them get to know you.
It is important to have regular talks with your
care team about your goals for treatment and
your treatment plan.





Depending on your diagnosis, your team might
include the following:












A diagnostic radiologist interprets the
results of x-rays and other imaging tests.



An interventional radiologist
performs needle biopsies and places
ports for treatment.
A medical oncologist treats cancer in
adults using systemic therapy.



A radiation oncologist prescribes and
plans radiation therapy to treat cancer.


A hematologist or hematologic
oncologist is a medical expert in blood
diseases and blood cancers.



A pathologist or hematopathologist
analyzes the cells and tissues removed
during a biopsy and provides cancer
diagnosis, staging, and information about
biomarker testing.

An anesthesiologist gives anesthesia,
a medicine so you do not feel pain during
surgery or procedures.
Residents and fellows are doctors
who are continuing their training, some
to become specialists in a certain field of
medicine.
Nurse practitioners (NPs) and
physician assistants (PAs) are health
care providers. Some of your clinic visits
may be done by a nurse practitioner or
physician assistant.
Oncology nurses provide your
hands-on care, like giving systemic
therapy, managing your care, answering
questions, and helping you cope with side
effects.
Oncology pharmacists provide
medicines used to treat cancer and to
manage symptoms and side effects.
Palliative care nurses, advanced
practice providers (APPs), and
physicians help provide cancer care,
may prescribe necessary medicines, and
provide an extra layer of support with your
cancer-related symptoms.
Nutritionists and dietitians can
provide guidance on what foods are most
suitable for your condition.
An occupational therapist helps
people with the tasks of daily living.

Psychologists and psychiatrists are
mental health experts who can help treat
and manage issues such as depression,
anxiety, or other mental health conditions
that can affect how you think and feel.

Get to know your care
team and help them

Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional issues. The anxiety and
adjustment an individual and family feels
when diagnosed with cancer might be
managed by a social worker in some
cancer centers. They, or other designated
professionals, can also help navigate the
complexities of financial and insurance
stresses.
Research team helps to collect
research data and coordinate care if you
are in a clinical trial.

Your physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing are important. You know yourself better

whether it’s forgetting to take medicine,
missing a treatment appointment, or
participating in activities or taking supplements
that can cause treatment not to work as well
as it could. Talk to your care team about

More information on distress can be found
at NCCN.org/PatientGuidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Pick a treatment plan that works for you.
Talk to your care team about any concerns
or challenges that you have. Take all of
your medicine as prescribed. Take the
recommended amounts, at the right time.
Skipping or delaying doses may change the
drug’s effects. If you’re having difficulty paying
for medicine, ask your treatment team for help.

Supportive care

Fatigue

Supportive care is health care given during
all cancer stages. It aims to prevent, reduce,
and relieve suffering, and to improve quality
of life. Supportive care might include palliative
care, pain relief, emotional or spiritual support,
financial aid, or family counseling. Tell your
care team how you are feeling and about
any side effects so they can be managed.
Supportive care and palliative care are often
used interchangeably.

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may be
caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of
treatment. Let your care team know how you
are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of
doing the things you enjoy. Eating a balanced
diet, exercise, yoga, and massage therapy can
help. You might be referred to a nutritionist or
dietitian to help with fatigue.

Financial stress

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.
Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment.

If you struggle to pay for food, housing,
treatment, follow-up care, and other expenses
or have difficulty getting to appointments, talk
with your care team’s social worker, patient
navigators, and hospital financial services.
They can help you find financial support and
transportation options.

Distress
Depression, anxiety, and sleep issues are
common during and after cancer treatment.
Talk to your care team and with those whom
you feel most comfortable about how you
are feeling. There are services, people, and
medicine that can help you. Support and
counseling services are available.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They

Lymphedema is a condition in which extra
lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes
swelling. It may be caused when part of the
lymph system is damaged or blocked, such
as during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression sleeves, and
other means. Ask your care team about the

Neuropathy
Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment such as
chemotherapy. Ask your care team what can
be done to prevent or manage neuropathy.

Neurocognitive effects
Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems
with concentration and memory. Survivors
are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be
recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of
your brain affects your thinking and behavior.
Neuropsychological testing can identify your
limits and doctors can create a plan to help
with these limits.

Hearing

Blood disorders

Some treatments can affect hearing. Hearing
(audiology) testing might be recommended.

You might be at higher risk for blood disorders
such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
myelodysplasia (MDS) if you were exposed to
heavy metals, some types of systemic (drug)
therapy, or had a hematopoietic (stem) cell
transplant (HCT).

Heart
Certain treatments can affect heart (cardiac)
function. Heart tests might be recommended
to see how well your heart works. You might
be referred to a cardiologist or an oncocardiologist. Everyone should have their blood
pressure and cholesterol levels monitored on a
yearly basis.

More information on AML and MDS can be
found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Kidneys and bladder
The kidneys filter blood to remove waste,
extra water, and substances such as those
used in cancer treatment. The bladder holds
this waste in the form of urine before it leaves
the body. Cancer drugs can collect in and
harm the kidneys and bladder. Blood tests
and blood pressure readings can help monitor
the health of your kidneys. Let your heath
care provider know if you have bladder pain,
difficulty urinating, or are prone to urinary tract
infections.

Graft-versus-host disease
If you had a donor stem cell transplant called
an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(alloHCT), then you will be monitored for graftversus-host disease (GVHD). In GVHD, the
donor cells attack your normal, healthy tissue.
There are treatments for GVHD.

with radiation therapy and certain types of
systemic therapy, then you might undergo lung
function screening.

Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration, memory, and thinking. Survivors
are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be
recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of
your brain affects your thinking and behavior.
Neuropsychological testing can identify your
limits and a health care professional can
create a plan to help with these limits.

Neuroendocrine
Neuroendocrine is the interaction between
the nervous system and endocrine system. It
describes certain cells that release hormones
into the blood in response to stimulation of the
nervous system. Radiation to certain areas of
the body can affect hormone levels. Ask your
health care provider (HCP) what screening
might be recommended.

Skin
Those who had radiation therapy as part of
a treatment plan are at risk for developing
skin lesions, cancer, or other skin-related
conditions. However, a yearly skin exam
performed by a dermatologist is recommended
for everyone.

illness, and death caused by a specific virus
or bacteria. Vaccination is the use of a vaccine
to give you immunity to a disease. Vaccines
cause an immune response that helps the
body recognize and destroy bacteria, viruses,
or cancer cells. Immunization is the process
by which you become protected against a
disease. Depending on the time since you
completed cancer treatment and the type
of cancer you had, your HCP might need to
consult a specialist to understand the best
timing for certain vaccinations.

Secondary cancers

Colorectal cancer

AYA survivors may be at risk for developing
another cancer or secondary cancer. This is
not the return or recurrence of your original
cancer, but a different cancer as a result
of treatment with radiation and/or systemic
(drug) therapy. The type of secondary cancer
depends on the age when you were diagnosed
with the original cancer, type and dose of
systemic, and/or location and dose of radiation
therapy. It is important to take care of yourself
by eating well, drinking plenty of water,
avoiding tobacco products and recreational
drugs, limiting alcohol, and keeping wellness
visits, health screenings, medical and dental
appointments, and follow-up blood and
imaging testing.

Screening for colorectal cancers may be
recommended in AYAs with inherited or family
risk factors. More information on
colorectal screening can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the

Breast cancer screening
Screening for breast cancer may be
recommended in AYAs with inherited or family
risk factors. More information on
breast screening and diagnosis can be found
at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

AYAs, especially those with risk factors, should
be made aware of the importance of early
diagnosis and self-examination of the skin,
breasts, and testicles as recommended by the
American Cancer Society. Ask your HCP for
more information and your risk for developing
certain cancers. Risk for developing cancer
may or may not be related to your disease,
treatment, family history, or other health
issues. Certain cancer screenings are
recommended for everyone.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome
AYAs with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or LFS
(resulting from germline mutations in the
TP53 tumor suppressor gene) or germline
mutations in the retinoblastoma (RB) gene are
at higher risk of developing osteosarcoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma.
AYAs with a family history of Li-Fraumeni
syndrome have a higher risk of developing
not only sarcomas but a wide variety of
cancers including leukemia, brain tumors,
breast cancer, and adrenocortical carcinoma
before 40 years of age. Screening may be
recommended by genetic counseling.

HPV can cause cervical cancer. HPV may also
increase the risk of developing other types of
cancer, such as anal, vaginal, vulvar, penile,
and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV vaccination
is recommended in adolescents 9 to 12 years
of age. However, HPV vaccination can be
given through 26 years of age.

Those with multiple neuroendocrine neoplasia

Living with and beyond
cancer

Support from others
Family, friends, and coworkers can find it
difficult to know how and when to support a
person who has or had cancer. Reach out
to others when you need help. Healing and
recovery from the experience will take time.
Everyone is different. Be clear whether or
not you want to celebrate a milestone or
anniversary. It’s okay to change your mind!

Most of us probably think of a survivor as
someone who has been cured of cancer.
However, a person is considered a cancer
survivor from the time of diagnosis and
throughout life. And so, defining survivorship
can be a challenge not only for the person who
has or had cancer, but also a challenge for
their family, friends, caregivers, or coworkers.
Some people don’t like the word “survivor”
because it doesn’t accurately describe how
they feel. If you don’t like the word “survivor,”
then choose another word. Define for yourself
what it means to be someone who is living with
or beyond cancer. Share with others the words
you choose to represent how you feel.

Distress
Distress, depression, and anxiety are common
among AYA cancer survivors. Counseling
and practical support will help you during and
after cancer treatment. Seek out peer support
groups. Talk to your care team. Ask for a
referral to a specialist or other professional
who can help.

Survivorship focuses on the physical, social,
emotional, and financial issues unique to
cancer survivors. Managing the long-term side
effects of cancer and its treatment, staying
connected with your primary care doctor, and
living a healthy lifestyle are important parts of
survivorship. Cancer survivors may experience
both short- and long-term health effects of
cancer and its treatment. These effects are
different for everyone and depend on the
treatment(s) received.

Stress and coping
Coping skills are strategies a person uses to
deal with stressful situations. These skills can
be learned and each person has a different
way of coping. Eating a balanced diet,
exercise, quality sleep, and fun or relaxing
activities can help. Reach out for support to
manage stress and build coping strategies.

Life changes

Milestones

Being a cancer survivor can add new layers
of complexity to your personal life and
relationships. You may question who to tell
about your history, how much they need to
know, and when you should tell them. It can
take time to recover from the effects of cancer
treatment. Survivors may take on too much.
Friends and family may not realize you still
need their support.

Many cancer survivors have mixed emotions
about milestones and anniversaries of certain
cancer-related dates. Not everyone wants
to celebrate the end of treatment or the
anniversary of being cancer-free. Your feelings
might change over time or from year-to-year.
Prepare yourself in advance for anniversary
dates, consider ways to sort through complex
emotions, and decide if you want to reflect on
your experiences.

Surviving cancer can also give you a new point
of view on life and what you want from it. You
may find new ways to take advantage of what
life brings your way or set new goals for your
future.

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit

At school
Challenges with concentration and memory
can make it hard to get back to your school
life. Try cutting back on your course load.
Plan more time to study and to complete
assignments. If any treatment-related side
effects are making it hard to keep up, let your
care team know.

If you smoke tobacco or use e-cigarettes,
it is very important to quit. Smoking can
limit how well cancer treatment works.
Smoking greatly increases your chances
of having side effects during and after
surgery. It also increases your chances of
developing other cancers.

Neuropsychological testing can identify your
strengths and weaknesses, and your care
team can work with your school to create a
plan to help address these limitations. You
can also talk with your teachers/professors
or school counselor about changing your
schedule and adjusting deadlines.
If you’re facing financial challenges, consider
applying for some of the many scholarships
and grants available to students who are
cancer survivors.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco
that makes you want to keep smoking.
Nicotine withdrawal is challenging for
most smokers. The stress of having
cancer may make it even harder to quit.
If you smoke, ask your doctor about
counseling and medicines to help you
quit.

Returning to work after treatment might cause

Recurrence
Recurrence is the return of cancer. Give

You know more. The first time, everything
was a surprise. Now, you have
experience.
You have built relationships. If the same
treatment team is seeing you, you are
with people you already know and trust.
You know what works for you. Instead of
trial and error, you can draw on your first
experience when making decisions about
dealing with side effects, planning your
life, and making use of support services.

Use the lessons learned during your first round
of cancer to help with decision-making and
take control of the situation.

Survivorship care plan

Recommended vaccinations:

A survivorship care plan is a detailed plan
given to you after treatment ends. It contains
a summary of your treatment, along with
recommendations for follow-up care. Getting
follow-up care also helps check for health
problems that may occur months or years
after treatment ends, including other types of
cancer. For AYAs, a survivorship care plan
may also include information to help meet
psychosocial, legal, and financial needs.

This chapter provides an overview

might want to stop cancer treatment. You can
also decide what treatments you would want
for symptom relief, such as radiation therapy,
surgery, or medicine. Most people change
their minds as they learn and experience
more during their cancer treatment. You can
change your advance care plan at any time. It
is helpful to have this talk with your care team
and/or friends, family, and caregivers more
than once during your treatment. What you
want today might change tomorrow. Making
your wishes clear will ensure everyone knows
what you want.

of advance care planning,
survivorship care plans, palliative
care, and end-of-life care.

Even when cancers are highly curable,
discussion about future scenarios, including
advance directives and end-of-life preferences,
should begin when starting treatment. This
exploration of what is important to you is often
called advance care planning.

Some decisions are important to put in writing.
These are called advance directives and
are only a part of the larger advance care
planning conversations. Advance directives
include decisions about who makes decisions
for you if you are too sick or unable to tell the
doctors yourself, as well as the limits of what
you would be willing to experience. Once you
have decided, you will fill out a legal document
called an advance directive that shares these
details. Doctors are required by law to follow
the care instructions in an advance directive.
Health care professionals will not do anything
that is illegal even if it is in your advance
directive. This is why it is important to speak
with your care team. Just like advance care
plans, advance directives can change if you
want them to. Frequent conversations with
your care team can help.

Advance care planning
Advance care planning (ACP) is making
decisions now about the care you would want
to receive if you become unable to speak
for yourself. Advance care planning is for
everyone, not just for those who are very
sick. It is a way to ensure your wishes are
understood and respected.
Advance care planning starts with a discussion
with your care team and/or your family. Ask
about your cancer prognosis and what to
expect if your cancer progresses. Help your
care team understand what matters to you
and how you might consider “quality” of life.
Discuss the medicines or therapies that best
enable you to experience that quality of life.
Include family, friends, and caregivers in your
advance care planning. Make your wishes
clear. It is important that everyone understands
what you want.

If your family disagrees with your plan, speak
to your care team. Sometimes they or other
specialists can help you and your family
navigate these difficult conversations. When
AYAs share their wishes, families usually follow
their requests, even when they would not have
made the same choices themselves.

You don’t have to know the exact details of
your prognosis. Just having a general idea
will help with planning. With this information,
you can decide if there is a point where you

Palliative care

An advance directive will include
information on how much you want your
doctors to do if your heart or lungs stop
working or if you are no longer able to eat.

Palliative care is an important part of
comprehensive cancer care. The goal of
palliative care is to control symptoms, relieve
emotional and physical suffering that comes
from the diagnosis and treatment of cancer,
and improve quality of life for patients and
their families, regardless of the stage of the
disease or the need for other therapies.
Palliative care specialists are highly trained in
navigating difficult conversations with patients
and families, and can help you think about
things like advance care planning and what is
important to you. Palliative care services for
AYAs are provided by a team with expertise
in understanding the psychosocial, emotional,
developmental, and financial issues that are
unique to this age group. Sometimes, palliative
care, supportive care, and best supportive care
are used interchangeably.

An advance directive may ask what you
would want if you had a severe disability,
or were no longer able to think or act for
yourself.
Many advance directives include
plans to limit what can be done if you
want a natural death. Do Not Attempt
Resuscitation or Do Not Resuscitate
(DNAR or DNR) and Do Not Intubate
(DNI) orders tell medical providers not to
revive you with CPR (cardiopulmonary
resuscitation) or use a breathing machine.

Name the person who will make health care
decisions for you (health care proxy) in the
advance directive. This person may have to
make some very tough decisions. Choose
carefully when selecting your proxy and make
sure the proxy feels comfortable representing
you.

End-of-life care
End-of-life (EOL) care provides supportive,
emotional, and spiritual support. It may be
called comfort care or hospice. Note that
hospice is a special kind of EOL care. It
refers specifically to an insurance benefit
that supports those at the EOL by providing
additional care providers and resources
such as homecare. It also provides support
to caregivers and family members. EOL
discussions will include the things you have
discussed in your advance care plans and
advance directives, as well as your views
about medical technologies and services like
tube feeding and sedation, the place of death,
and how to support family members and
caregivers. Medically intense care at the endof-life is more common than you might think,
and it is often not what patients would have

Tell your care team and family about your
advance directive and its contents. Give a
copy of your advance directive to all of your
doctors. Make sure the person you have
chosen to speak on your behalf has a copy.
Make your wishes clear. If you and your
family disagree about treatment, the advance
directive should reflect your wishes—not
what you think your parents or partner would
want. An advance directive can be changed. If
your thoughts on feeding tubes or respirators
change, you can change your advance
directive. When you make changes, give
everyone a copy of the new advance directive.

wanted for themselves. Therefore, having this
difficult conservation is important.

If you have any
religious or personal
beliefs about certain
kinds of treatment,
share them with your
care team.

The goal of EOL care is to give people the
best life possible with the time they have left.
Specifically, it aims to:


Control symptoms



Ease physical and emotional suffering



Improve quality of life

Completing an advance directive to plan for
end-of-life care is important. It will help you
feel in control. An advance directive is a legal
document that states your wishes in writing.
Discuss your options for end-of life care with
your care team. Ask what life might be like as
your cancer progresses. Talk things over with
your friends, family, and caregivers. Many
AYAs want to die at home. This is not always
possible. Discuss your wishes early on and
throughout your treatment.

In addition to making plans about your EOL
care, organizing your personal and financial
affairs can lessen the stress on family and
friends after you are gone.


Services can be provided in your home, a
hospice facility, or in the hospital. Hospice and
palliative care doctors, nurses, social workers,
and chaplains are experts in helping you and
your family work through the spiritual and
emotional challenges of coping with death.
Providing support for family members is a
major part of the hospice approach to end-oflife care. Most programs offer counseling and
support groups for family members, including
grief support.



Clear up any insurance questions. Find
out which EOL services your provider will
cover and clarify any limitations in the
coverage (such as a cap on the number
of visits by a nurse or health aide). Some
forms of treatment may still be covered if
they are being prescribed to relieve pain
or symptoms.
Organize your financial records like
bank accounts, insurance policies, and
mortgage to make sure your family knows
where everything is. The National Cancer
Institute’s book, Coping with Advanced
Cancer, (cancer.gov/publications/patienteducation/advanced-cancer) has a
detailed worksheet you can use.

Think about making the arrangements for a
funeral or memorial service in advance.
