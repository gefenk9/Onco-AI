About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma,
Version 3.2024 — April 30, 2024.

The small bowel

Many small intestine (bowel)
cancers are adenocarcinomas.

When food leaves your stomach, it enters
the small bowel. The first part is the
duodenum. More than half of all small bowel
adenocarcinomas start here. These tumors
can block food from passing between the
stomach and the rest of the small bowel. This
causes vomiting because the food doesn’t
have anywhere to go.

These tumors start in mucusmaking cells on the inner lining
of the small bowel. Seeking
treatment within a clinical trial is
encouraged for these uncommon
cancers.

The rest of these cancers start in either
the jejunum, or less often, in the ileum.
Tumors that form in the lower sections of the
small bowel may cause nausea, vomiting,
constipation, cramping, and abdominal pain.
Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is also common
in people with a small bowel adenocarcinoma.

The small bowel
Most small bowel
adenocarcinomas
start in the duodenum.
The rest start in the
jejunum, or less often,
in the ileum.

Who gets small bowel
adenocarcinoma?

The loss of blood causes fatigue, weakness,
pale skin, and other symptoms. This is called
iron deficiency anemia.

Compared to large bowel (colorectal) cancers,
small bowel adenocarcinoma tends to be
diagnosed at an earlier age, and at a later
stage. This is partly because there isn’t a good
way to screen for it, even for people at high risk.
The cancer is usually found because the tumor
causes problems and symptoms as it grows.

If left untreated, the cancer cells will grow from
the inner lining of the bowel, through the outer
layers of the bowel wall and towards other
organs and tissues in the abdomen. Cancer
cells can also break off from the small bowel
tumor and travel through lymph or blood to
nearby lymph nodes or to more distant organs.

A risk factor is something that increases your
risk of developing a health problem. Risk
factors for small bowel adenocarcinoma are
similar to those for colorectal cancer. They
include lifestyle factors, inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), and certain hereditary cancer
syndromes.

Small bowel adenocarcinoma can be hard to
treat. The only way to cure it is to surgically
remove it. But in about 1 in 3 people, the
cancer will return after surgery. This is called
relapse or recurrence.

Lifestyle factors
Because small bowel cancer is so rare, there
isn't much data on lifestyle factors that may

Inflammatory bowel diseases,
such as ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease, may raise
the risk of cancer in the lower
sections of the small bowel.
People with celiac disease
may also be at higher risk of
small bowel adenocarcinoma.

increase the risk of developing it. Drinking
alcohol, using tobacco, and certain eating
habits may increase the risk of this cancer.
Food and diet-related risk factors include not
getting enough fiber, eating a lot of red or
processed meats, and drinking sugary drinks.



Inflammatory bowel disease and
celiac disease



Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of
health problems that cause long-term swelling
and damage in the digestive tract. Ulcerative
colitis and Crohn’s disease are types of IBD.
There is a known link between IBD and large
bowel (colorectal) cancer. Research suggests
that IBD also increases the risk of cancer
in the lower sections of the small bowel,
especially the ileum.



People with celiac disease may also be at
increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma.
In people with this condition, eating gluten (a
protein in certain grains) causes an immune
reaction. Symptoms can include diarrhea,
bloating, and gas. The link between celiac
disease and small bowel cancer isn’t well
understood.



Hereditary cancer syndromes
Some rare conditions that affect families
increase the risk of small bowel cancer. These
hereditary conditions include Lynch syndrome,
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and familial
adenomatous polyposis. These rare conditions
are discussed more in the next chapter.

Many small intestine (bowel) cancers are
adenocarcinomas. These tumors start in
mucus-making cells on the inner lining of
the small bowel. Most form in the first part
of the small bowel, called the duodenum.
People with an inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) or one of several hereditary
cancer syndromes are at higher risk of
small bowel adenocarcinoma. Drinking
alcohol, using tobacco, and certain eating
habits may also increase the chance of
developing this cancer.
Most small bowel adenocarcinomas are
found because they cause problems
as they grow. Symptoms can include
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
cramping, constipation, weakness,
fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Seeking treatment within a clinical trial
is encouraged for these uncommon
cancers.

This chapter discusses testing

Computed tomography

for small bowel adenocarcinoma

Computed tomography (CT) is the main
imaging test used to learn the extent of small
bowel cancer in the body. CT scans of your
chest, abdomen, and pelvis are recommended.
This is roughly the area from your shoulders to
your groin.

and other steps needed to create
your treatment plan. All small
bowel adenocarcinomas should
be tested for a feature called

A substance called contrast is usually used to
make the pictures clearer. It may be injected
into your vein and/or mixed with a liquid to
drink. If you’ve had an allergic reaction to
contrast in the past, you may be given or
asked to take a steroid and an antihistamine
medication (like Benadryl) before the scan.

mismatch repair deficiency.

Imaging
Imaging tests can show areas of cancer inside
the body. A radiologist interprets the images
and conveys the results to your oncologist.
Your care team will tell you how to prepare for
your scans.

During the scan you will lie face-up on a
table that moves through a short tunnel-like
machine. You will be able to hear and talk to
the technician at all times.

CT with contrast is the
main imaging test used
to determine the extent of
small bowel cancer in the
body. CT scans of your
chest, abdomen, and
pelvis are recommended
if a small bowel cancer is
suspected.

2 Testing » Endoscopy procedures » Endoscopy procedures

MRI

Endoscopy procedures

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) isn’t used
often to plan treatment for small bowel cancer.
Your doctor may order an MRI of the abdomen
and pelvis if you can’t have the contrast used
for computed tomography, or if CT images
were unclear.

Endoscopy is an important tool in the
diagnosis of small bowel adenocarcinoma. It
allows your provider to see inside the small
bowel and remove tissue samples for testing
(a biopsy).
Endoscopy involves inserting a thin, tubeshaped tool called a scope into the body. The
scope is guided through a natural opening,
usually the mouth. One end of the scope has a
small light and camera lens.

If you do need an MRI, the scanning process
takes longer compared to CT. You may need to
hold your breath for brief periods of time. The
tunnel is longer and may be more narrow. Tell
your team if you get nervous in small spaces.
You may be given a sedative (medicine) to
help you relax.

Types of endoscopy that may be used for
small bowel adenocarcinoma are described
next.

MRI doesn't use radiation and is safe for most
people. Those with certain heart monitors,
pacemakers, or some types of surgical clips
generally can’t have MRI scanning.

EGD
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is
recommended for suspected tumors in the
first part of the small bowel, the duodenum.
EGD allows your provider to look for signs of
cancer or other issues, such as enlarged blood
vessels or ulcers. While you are sedated, an
endoscope is guided down your throat, through
the esophagus and stomach, and into the
duodenum.
If it's unclear whether the tumor is in the small
bowel or in a connecting organ (such as the
head of the pancreas), endoscopic ultrasound
(EUS) may be used during EGD. It can also
be used if the extent of the cancer is unclear
based on other imaging, or to biopsy areas
outside the bowel (like nearby lymph nodes).
EGD usually takes less than an hour. You can
go home the same day. Your throat may feel
sore or swollen afterward.

2 Testing » Biopsy and tissue testing

Biopsy and tissue testing

Balloon enteroscopy
Over time, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
can cause scar tissue to form in the lining of
the bowel. This causes the bowel to narrow
in certain areas, called strictures. Balloon
enteroscopy can be helpful when there are
strictures.

The tissue samples and lymph nodes removed
during endoscopy are sent to a lab for testing.
An expert called a pathologist determines the
cancer type and other details about the cancer.
All small bowel adenocarcinomas should be
tested for DNA mismatch repair (MMR) testing,
described next.

Using a long thin tube (enteroscope) with
a high-resolution camera at the tip, your
gastroenterologist guides the scope either
down your throat or up your anus to reach
the small bowel. Small balloons attached to
the scope inflate and deflate. This allows your
provider to see and biopsy areas that would
otherwise be blocked.

Mismatch repair testing
This feature of some cancers is a type of
biomarker. Biomarkers are targetable changes
of a cancer that can help guide your treatment.
Testing involves analyzing a piece of the tumor
(removed during a biopsy or surgery) in a lab.
Depending on the method used, an abnormal
result is called either mismatch repair
deficiency (dMMR) or microsatellite instabilityhigh (MSI-H). Tumors that don’t have these
changes are referred to as mismatch repair
proficient (pMMR) or microsatellite stable
(MSS).

Capsule endoscopy
When a problem in the small bowel is
suspected but can't be seen using imaging or
other types of endoscopy, capsule endoscopy
may be helpful.
This involves swallowing a capsule with a
tiny camera inside. While the capsule travels
through your digestive tract, the camera takes
thousands of pictures and transmits them to
a device. The device turns the pictures into a
video that your provider can view.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma, 2024

Compared to colorectal cancers,
dMMR is more common in small bowel
adenocarcinomas. This means that inherited
problems with the MMR genes are also more
likely. If the cancer is dMMR/MSI-H, you will
also be tested for Lynch syndrome.

11

2 Testing » Family health history » Blood tests

Family health history

Blood tests

Most small bowel adenocarcinomas occur
for unknown reasons. But some people are
born with a gene mutation that makes them
more likely to get bowel cancer and other
cancers. Those born with Lynch syndrome, for
example, are at high risk of developing bowel,
endometrial, and ovarian cancers.

Blood tests alone can't confirm small bowel
adenocarcinoma, but abnormal results may
suggest a problem.

General health
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
number of white blood cells, red blood cells,
and platelets in a blood sample. White blood
cells help you fight infection. Red blood cells
carry oxygen throughout the body. Platelets
help wounds heal by forming blood clots.

Lynch syndrome is caused by inherited
mutations of genes that fix damaged DNA,
called mismatch repair (MMR) genes. All small
bowel adenocarcinomas should be tested for
problems with the MMR genes. If the cancer is
dMMR/MSI-H, you will also be tested for Lynch
syndrome.

A chemistry profile, also known as a
comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), is
a group of tests that shows how well your
kidneys, liver, and other organs are working.

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a condition that
causes polyps to form in the middle and lower
sections of the small bowel (the jejunum and
ileum). Small bowel adenocarcinoma can
start in these polyps, putting those with this
syndrome at risk.

Tumor markers
Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are proteins
normally made by digestive organs. They can
be detected and measured in blood. People
with small bowel adenocarcinoma tend to have
more than normal.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a
rare inherited cancer syndrome that causes
hundreds to thousands of polyps to form in
the colon and rectum, and rarely in the small
bowel. The polyps start as benign growths, but
over time can become invasive cancers.

When caused by cancer, high levels at
diagnosis often mean a higher cancer stage.
Your care team will take these levels into
account when planning treatment. Levels may
be checked to see if they are changing.

If your provider thinks you may have an
inherited syndrome, they will refer you to
a genetic counselor. This expert can talk
with you and your family about getting
tested for syndromes related to small bowel
adenocarcinoma. If they determine that testing
is appropriate, they can order a blood or saliva
test to see if you have an inherited gene
mutation.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma, 2024

Tumor marker levels can't be used alone to
diagnose small bowel adenocarcinoma, for a
few reasons. High levels can be caused by
other health conditions. Some people with
small bowel cancer have normal levels. And,
some people don't make CA 19-9 naturally.

Fertility and family planning

CT is used to see the extent of small
bowel cancer in the body. If you can’t
have the contrast agent for CT or if the
images are unclear, MRI may be used to
view the abdomen and pelvis.

If you want the option of having children
after treatment or are unsure, tell your care
team. Your doctor will discuss any fertilityrelated risks of your treatment plan with
you. You may be referred for counseling
about your fertility preservation options.

Endoscopy allows your provider to see
and biopsy the small bowel using a thin
tube with a lens for viewing. EGD is
recommended for suspected cancers in
the duodenum. Endoscopic ultrasound
may be used to confirm the location or
extent of the cancer, or to guide biopsies
of areas outside the bowel.

For more information, see the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients for Adolescent and
Young Adult Cancer at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Balloon enteroscopy may be used when
the bowel is too narrow to access with
a scope. Capsule endoscopy may be
helpful if other imaging and endoscopy
procedures can't find the problem.
Biopsies or other tumor tissue tests
are needed to diagnose small bowel
adenocarcinoma. All small bowel
adenocarcinomas should be tested for
mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). If the
cancer has this biomarker, the next step
is to test your blood or saliva for inherited
changes in the MMR genes. These are
the gene changes that cause Lynch
syndrome.
Small bowel adenocarcinoma is linked
with other rare hereditary cancer
syndromes. Depending on your family
health history, your provider may refer you
to a genetic counselor for guidance and
possibly genetic testing.

the small bowel (the jejunum). Then, either
the stomach or duodenum is attached farther
down on the jejunum. Blood vessels may need
reconstruction.

adenocarcinoma that is contained
within the small bowel is treated
with surgery. Chemotherapy
may follow. Metastatic cancer
is usually treated with systemic

Segmentectomy

therapy.

This type of surgery is recommended for
cancers in the middle or last parts of the
small bowel. It is also used for cancers in
the duodenum that don’t require a Whipple
procedure.

Non-metastatic (stage 1,
2, and 3) cancer

Your surgeon will remove the tumor and 5 to
10 centimeters (about 2 to 4 inches) of normallooking tissue on either side of it. They will also
remove lymph nodes closest to the tumor and
any others nearby that look suspicious.

A cancer that can be safely removed with
surgery (resection) is called resectable.
Resection is recommended for non-metastatic
small bowel adenocarcinoma when possible.
The surgeon will also remove all nearby lymph
nodes. If you aren’t a candidate for surgery,
see page 17.

Staging
The tissue and lymph nodes removed
during surgery are sent to a lab for testing. A
pathologist assesses how far the cancer has
grown within the bowel wall and assigns the
cancer a stage of I (1), II (2), or III (3). This
process is called surgical staging. The stage
is used to determine whether chemotherapy is
needed.

Whipple procedure
Most small bowel adenocarcinomas start
in the duodenum. A Whipple procedure is
often recommended, especially if the cancer
has grown into any part of the pancreas or
common bile duct. This surgery, also called
pancreaticoduodenectomy, removes:

More about chemotherapy

Stage 2
For stage 2 cancers, treatment after surgery
depends on the mismatch repair (MMR) status
of the cancer and whether there are high-risk
features. In staging terms, stage 2 cancers are
written as T3 or T4, N0, M0.

If chemotherapy is planned after surgery, your
options may include 1 or more of the regimens
listed below. The individual medicines in these
regimens are listed in Guide 1.

Observation is recommended for dMMR
or MSI-H stage 2 cancers. The benefit of
chemotherapy after surgery is less clear for
pMMR or MSS stage 2 cancers. These may be
observed or treated with chemotherapy.
Stage 3
If cancer cells are found in any lymph nodes
removed during surgery, the cancer is stage 3.
Chemotherapy is recommended after surgery
for all stage 3 cancers. Radiation therapy may
be used in addition to chemotherapy.

cause potentially permanent nerve damage
(called neuropathy) in the fingers and toes.
Symptoms include numbness, cramping,
tingling, or pain in these areas.

Chemotherapy side effects
Systemic therapy kills both cancer cells
and healthy cells. The damage to healthy
cells can cause hair loss, cracked skin,
mouth sores, and other side effects.

Any regimen that has “IRI” in the name
contains the drug irinotecan. Irinotecan
tends to cause abdominal cramping, nausea,
diarrhea, and hair loss.

Managing side effects is a shared effort
between you and your care team. It is
important to speak up about bothersome
side effects, such as nausea and vomiting.
Ask about your options for managing or
relieving the effects of treatment.

If regimens containing oxaliplatin or irinotecan
are expected to be too harsh, your doctor may
recommend 5-FU/leucovorin or capecitabine
alone. These regimens also have side effects.
Capecitabine can cause hand-foot syndrome.
Symptoms include redness, swelling, and pain
on the palms of the hands, bottoms of the feet,
or both. Sometimes blisters appear.

More information on supportive care is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient Guides for
Cancer app.

What if I can’t have surgery?
If you aren’t a candidate for surgery, treatment
with chemotherapy is recommended.
Recommended regimens include:

FOLFIRINOX

In this case, the bowel needs to be unblocked
before starting systemic therapy. This is done
using one of several surgical techniques. Or, a
mesh metal tube with a stent may be used for
duodenal tumors.

If chemotherapy works well, surgery may
become an option. If the cancer stays
unresectable, your doctor may recommend
chemoradiation next. Otherwise, continuing
chemotherapy or switching to a different
systemic therapy is recommended.
Tumors growing in or around the bowel can
block stool from moving and leaving the body.

3 Treatment » Surveillance

Surveillance

People who have inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) or a familial cancer syndrome (like Lynch
syndrome) are at high risk of forming more
small bowel adenocarcinomas. More intensive
surveillance may be needed and might include
endoscopy of the small bowel.

After surgery (and chemotherapy, if given),
surveillance testing is done to:


Check for late side effects of treatment



Check for cancer recurrence



Check for new areas of cancer growth

In addition to surveillance testing, a range of
other care is important for cancer survivors.
For more information, see Chapter 4:
Survivorship.

Metastatic (stage 4) cancer

Biomarker testing
Biomarkers are features of a cancer that may
be targetable. They are often non-inherited
mutations (changes) in the tumor’s genes.

Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells
through lymph or blood to other organs in the
body. About 1 in 3 people diagnosed with small
bowel adenocarcinoma has stage 4 cancer.
This means that the cancer had already
spread to the liver, abdominal lining, lungs, or
other organs by the time it was found.

When possible, biomarker testing is performed
on a piece of tumor tissue removed during
a biopsy or surgery. If this isn't an option, a
sample of your blood can be tested instead.

Surgery to resect areas of metastatic spread
(metastasectomy) is rarely an option. Most
people receive treatment with systemic
therapy. Biomarker testing helps guide the
choice of systemic therapy.

Testing for many biomarkers at one time is
called next-generation sequencing (NGS). This
method can find rare biomarkers for which
targeted treatments may be available.
All metastatic small bowel adenocarcinomas
should be tested for the following biomarkers:

3 Treatment » Metastatic (stage 4) cancer

Systemic therapy
Surgery is rarely an option for treating
metastatic small bowel adenocarcinoma.
Most people receive treatment with systemic
therapy. The regimen you receive first is called
first-line therapy.

Immunotherapy side effects
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have
unique side effects. Unlike other
cancer treatments, the side effects of
immunotherapy occur because the
immune system is attacking healthy cells.
Learning about possible side effects can
help you notice reactions early and report
them to your care team.

For cancers with the dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/
POLD1 biomarkers, checkpoint inhibitor
immunotherapy is recommended as first-line
therapy. Immunotherapy increases the activity
of parts of your immune system. This helps
your body find and destroy cancer cells.

More information on the side effects of
immune checkpoint inhibitors is available
at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Assuming you haven’t had treatment with a
checkpoint inhibitor, currently recommended
options include:

or CAPEOX, you shouldn't have more
chemotherapy that includes oxaliplatin. It can
cause serious nerve damage.
Your options for systemic therapy will depend,
in part, on whether the cancer has any
biomarkers. Targeted therapies available for
cancers with specific biomarkers are listed on
the next page in Guide 3.
Options for chemotherapy may include
irinotecan-based chemotherapy, docetaxel, or
paclitaxel.

3 Treatment » Clinical trials

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Finding a clinical trial
In the United States
NCCN Cancer Centers
NCCN.org/cancercenters

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the

Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,

provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.



Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. Try not to
be discouraged if you cannot join. New clinical
trials are always becoming available.



Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.



Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

When possible, resection is
recommended for non-metastatic small
bowel adenocarcinoma. Chemotherapy
may follow. A Whipple procedure is
often used for tumors in the duodenum.
Segmentectomy is often used for tumors
in the jejunum or ileum.
After surgery, observation is
recommended for all stage 1 cancers.
Chemotherapy is recommended for all
stage 3 cancers. For stage 2 cancers,
this depends on mismatch repair (MMR)
status. Observation is recommended for
stage 2 dMMR/MSI-H cancers. Stage
2 pMMR/MSS cancers tumors may be
observed or treated with chemotherapy.
All stage 4 (metastatic) adenocarcinomas
should be tested for dMMR/MSI-H, BRAF
mutations, and HER2 amplifications.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can
find other biomarkers such as TMB-H,
POLE/POLD1 mutations, RET fusions,
and NTRK fusions.
Surgery is rarely an option for treating
metastatic small bowel adenocarcinoma.
Most people start systemic therapy. For
cancers with the dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/
POLD1 biomarkers, immunotherapy is
recommended as first-line therapy.
Supportive care is available for everyone
with cancer to help with symptoms and
make you feel more comfortable.
Clinical trials provide access to
investigational treatments that may, in
time, be approved by the FDA.

team’s social worker, and your hospital’s
financial services department.

a healthy lifestyle are important
parts of survivorship.

Your primary care provider
After finishing cancer treatment, your
oncologist and primary care provider should
work together to make sure you get the followup care you need. Ask your oncologist for a
written survivorship care plan. Ideally, the plan
should include:

Help with side effects
Cancer survivors may experience both shortand long-term health effects of cancer and its
treatment. The effects depend in part on the
treatment(s) received. Surgery, anti-cancer
medicines, and radiation therapy all have
unique potential side effects.

Nerve damage

Recommendations for monitoring for the

The chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin can
damage nerves in your fingers and toes.
Symptoms include numbness, cramping,
tingling, and pain in these areas. If you have
painful nerve damage, duloxetine (Cymbalta)
or a gabapentinoid (gabapentin or pregabalin)
may help. If the pain is persistent, talk to your
doctor about seeing a pain management
specialist.

Other health care

Methods that may help with numbness,
cramping, and tingling include acupuncture,
heat, ice, and balanced physical activity.

Get other recommended health care for your
age, such as blood pressure screening, dental
care, hepatitis C screening, and immunizations
(like the flu shot).

Healthy habits
It is important to keep up with other aspects
of your health after cancer treatment. Steps
you can take to help prevent other health
problems and to improve your quality of life are
described next.

Quit smoking
If you smoke or vape, tell your care team. They
can help you find ways to quit that works for
you.

Cancer screening

Diet and exercise

Get screened for other types of cancer, such
as breast, prostate, and skin cancer. Your
primary care provider can tell you what cancer
screening tests you should have based on
your age and risk level.

Try to exercise for at least 150 minutes per
week. This will help you stay at a healthy
weight.
Eat a diet rich in plant-based foods. If you have
confirmed celiac disease, avoid foods that
contain gluten. Alcohol may increase the risk of
certain cancers. Drink little to no alcohol.

Experts recommend
that cancer survivors
eat a diet rich in plantbased foods such as
vegetables, fruits, and
whole grains.

It’s important to be comfortable

If you take the time to build a relationship with
your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your doctor.

It is normal to want to start treatment as
soon as possible. While cancer should not
be ignored, there is time to have another
doctor review your test results and suggest a
treatment plan. This is called getting a second
opinion, and it’s a normal part of cancer care.
Even doctors get second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else. Some things that may play a
role in your decision-making:



What you want and how that might differ
from what others want















Your religious and spiritual beliefs

Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages of
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting
Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from work

Questions to ask

How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these or come up with your own.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.
