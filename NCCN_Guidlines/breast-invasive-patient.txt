About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Breast Cancer, Version 1.2024 – January 25, 2024.

1 Breast cancer basics » The breast

Invasive breast cancer is cancer

Breast tissue contains glands that can make
milk. These milk glands are called lobules.
Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small
tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the
nipple.

that has spread from the milk
ducts or milk glands into the
breast tissue or nearby lymph
nodes.

The ring of darker breast skin is called the
areola. The raised tip within the areola is called
the nipple. The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is
a term that refers to both parts.

The breast

Lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph
vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your
armpit (axilla). Lymph is a clear fluid that
gives cells water and food. It also helps to
fight germs. Nodes near the armpit are called
axillary lymph nodes (ALNs).

The breast is an organ and a gland found
on the chest. The breast is made of milk
ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels,
ligaments, and other connective tissue. Behind
the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and
ribs. Muscle and ligaments help hold the
breast in place.

The breast
The breast is a glandular
organ made up of milk
ducts, fat, nerves, blood

1 Breast cancer basics » Breast cancer » How breast cancer spreads

Breast cancer

Metastasis
Unlike normal cells, cancer cells can spread
and form tumors in other parts of the body
called metastases. In this process, cancer
cells break away from the first (primary) tumor
and travel through blood or lymph vessels to
distant sites. Once in other sites, cancer cells
may form secondary tumors.

Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast.
Almost all breast cancers are a subtype called
carcinomas. Carcinomas are cancers that
start in the cells that line the inner or outer
surfaces of the body. There are different types
of breast carcinoma, most of which arise in
cells that make up the lining (epithelial cells)
in the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of
the breast. The most common types are either
ductal or lobular.



Anyone can develop breast cancer, including
those assigned male at birth. Although there
are some differences between those assigned
male and those assigned female at birth,
treatment is very similar for all genders.



Cancer that has spread to a body part far
from the primary tumor is called a distant
metastasis.

Breast cancer can metastasize almost
anywhere but most commonly spreads to the
bone (including spine), lungs, liver, brain, or
distant lymph nodes. Breast cancer that has
metastasized to other parts of the body is still
called breast cancer.

How breast cancer spreads
Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells.
Cancer cells differ from normal cells in the
following ways.

More information on metastatic breast cancer
is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Primary tumor
Over time, cancer cells form a mass called a
primary tumor.

Invasive
Cancer cells can grow into surrounding
tissues. Invasive breast cancer is breast
cancer that has spread from the milk ducts
or milk glands (lobules) into the surrounding
breast tissue or nearby lymph nodes.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

Cancer that has spread to a nearby body
part such as the axillary lymph nodes
is called a local metastasis. It might be
referred to as local/regional disease or
locally advanced.

Anyone can develop breast cancer, but
breast cancer occurs more frequently in
persons assigned female at birth.
Inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat,
blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and
connective tissue. Lobules are structures
that make breast milk. Ducts carry breast
milk from the lobules to the nipple.
Breast cancer arises from epithelial cells
(cells that make up the lining) in the
terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of the
breast.
Invasive breast cancer is cancer that
has grown outside the ducts or lobules
into surrounding tissue. Once outside
the ducts or lobules, breast cancer can
spread through lymph or blood to lymph
nodes or other parts of the body.

Anyone can develop breast
cancer, including those
assigned male at birth.
Although there are some
differences between those
assigned male and those
assigned female at birth,
treatment is very similar for
all genders.

to come in.

are the same. Treatment planning
starts with testing. Your care team
will want to gather information
about the cancer you have. This
chapter presents an overview of



the tests you might receive and
what to expect.



Test results
Results from biopsy and imaging studies will
be used to determine your treatment plan.
Treatment will be based on these findings. It
is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions and keep copies of your
test results.



Keep these things in mind:








Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.



Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.

Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.
They are great partners in your care.
In your contact list, include information on
the exact type of cancer you have, as well
as any treatments you've received and
the date each treatment started.
Set up a MyChart or health record
account if it’s available, which can help
you keep track your appointments and
communicate with your care team.

For possible tests, see Guide 1.

Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.
Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.

Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.

2 Testing for breast cancer » General health tests

General health tests

Family history
Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your care team will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history. Ask family members on both
sides of your family about their health issues
like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes,
and at what age they were diagnosed. It’s
important to know the specific type of cancer,
or where the cancer started, and if it is in
multiple locations, and if they had genetic
testing.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
(OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you
take. Some supplements interact and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

radiology, genetics), treatments, and
procedures. Organize items in the
folder by date.

Clinical breast exam
Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam
of the bare breast performed by a health care
provider to check for lumps or other changes.
It is done while you are seated and/or lying
down. Your provider should take time to
palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the
armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in
the room during the exam.

2 Testing for breast cancer » Fertility (all genders)

Fertility (all genders)

Preventing pregnancy during
treatment

Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect
your fertility, the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might change your fertility. To preserve your
fertility, you may need to take action before
starting cancer treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options
before starting treatment.

Cancer and cancer treatment can affect the
ovaries and damage sperm. If you become
pregnant during chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or other types of systemic therapy,
serious birth defects can occur. Speak with your
care team about preventing pregnancy while
being treated for cancer. Hormonal birth control
may or may not be recommended, so ask
your doctor about options such as intrauterine
devices (IUDs) and barrier methods. Types of
barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms,
cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want to
have children later in life or aren’t sure at the
moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists
can help you sort through what may be best for
your situation.

Those with ovaries
Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby
if you are or become pregnant during treatment.
Therefore, birth control to prevent pregnancy
during and after treatment is recommended. If
you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time
of your cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will
need to be avoided.

More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults, is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
period may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended during and after treatment. It
is important to talk to your doctor about what
methods of birth control are safe after a breast
cancer diagnosis. Consult your doctor for the
best time to plan a pregnancy.

Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

2 Testing for breast cancer » Blood tests

Those with testicles

Liver function tests

Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth
control) such as condoms to prevent pregnancy
during and immediately after cancer treatment.

Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that are
made or processed by the liver. Levels that
are too high or low signal that the liver is not
working well or that cancer has spread to the
liver. It is common to see a mild increase in
LFTs during chemotherapy

Blood tests

Pregnancy test

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein.

Those who can become pregnant will be given
a pregnancy test before treatment begins.

Alkaline phosphatase
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme
found in the blood. High levels of ALP can be a
sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver. A
bone scan might be performed if you have high
levels of ALP.

Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures
the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in
your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells fight
infection, and platelets control bleeding.

Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
measures 14 different substances in your
blood. It is usually done on the plasma part
of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.

Imaging tests

issues. Your care team may order x-rays if your
bones hurt or were abnormal on a bone scan.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Imaging tests show the primary
tumor, or where the cancer started, and look
for cancer in other parts of the body.

Contrast material
Contrast materials are not dyes, but
substances that help make the pictures of the
inside of the body clearer. The contrast is not
permanent and will leave the body in your
urine after the test. There is more than one
type of contrast and it differs depending on
the test. Tell your care team if you have had
allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This
is important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies.

A radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report to
your health care provider (HCP). It is likely that
the report will be sent directly to you through
your patient portal or patient access system.
You should discuss these results with your
HCP.
The following imaging tests are listed
in alphabetical order and not in order of
importance. You will not have all these tests.

CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your chest,
abdomen, and/or pelvis might be one of the
tests used to look for cancer. Intravenous (IV)
contrast is often used.

Bone scan
A bone scan uses a radiotracer. A radiotracer
is a substance that releases small amounts of
radiation. Before the pictures are taken, the
tracer will be injected into your vein. It can take
a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones.
However, the test is quick and painless.
A special camera will take pictures of the
tracer in your bones as it moves over your
body. Areas of bone damage take up more
radiotracer than healthy bone and show up
as bright spots on the pictures. Bone damage
can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment,
previous injuries, or other health issues.

Diagnostic mammogram

Bone x-ray

Diagnostic mammograms look at specific
areas of your breasts, which may not be
clearly seen on screening mammograms. It is
used to see tumor and the size of the tumor(s).
Diagnostic mammograms include extra
compression in certain areas of the breast,

A mammogram is a picture of the inside of
your breast. The picture is made using x-rays.
A computer combines the x-rays to make
detailed pictures. Mammogram results are
used to plan treatment.

An x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one
picture at a time. A tumor changes the way
radiation is absorbed and will show up on the
x-ray. X-rays are also good at showing bone

magnification views, or rolling the breast to
image additional areas of the breast. Other
diagnostic tests may include a breast MRI or
ultrasound.

What’s the difference
between a screening and
diagnostic mammogram?

MRI scan

A mammogram is a picture of the inside
of your breast made using x-rays. During
a mammogram, the breast is pressed
between two plates while you stand in
different positions. Multiple x-rays will be
taken. A computer combines the x-rays to
make detailed pictures.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.
A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.




Screening mammograms are done
on a regular basis when there are no
signs or symptoms of breast cancer.
Results take a few days.

•

Diagnostic mammograms are
used for those who have symptoms
such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening
or discharge, or whose breasts have
changed shape or size.

• Diagnostic mammograms are
also used to take a closer look at an
abnormal area found in a screening
mammogram.

A breast MRI might be used in addition
to a mammogram. Contrast should be
used. You will be positioned face down in
the machine with your arms above your
head.

•

A spine or brain MRI can be used
to detect breast cancer that has spread
(metastasize) to your spine or brain. For a
brain MRI, a device is placed around your
head. For a spine MRI, no device is worn.
Contrast should be used in an MRI.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

•

A radiologist will evaluate the
diagnostic mammogram while you
wait so if additional testing is needed, it
can be done right away.

Both types of mammograms use low-dose
x-rays to examine the breast. They may
use either the standard 2-dimensional (2D)
digital mammogram or 3-dimensional (3D)
mammogram known as tomosynthesis.

15

2 Testing for breast cancer » Biopsy

PET scan

Ultrasound

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans. However, not all tumors will
appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright
spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain,
heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on
PET. Inflammation or infection can also show
up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer) will
be held and moved on your bare breast using
gel. It may also be placed below your armpit.
Ultrasound does not use x-rays. It is good at
showing small areas of cancer that are near
the skin. Sometimes, a breast ultrasound or
MRI is used to guide a biopsy.







Biopsy

An FDG PET/CT uses a radiotracer
called F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It
is made of fluoride and a simple form of
sugar called glucose. You cannot eat or
drink for at least 4 hours before the scan.
This scan is most helpful when other
imaging results are unclear. It may help
find cancer in lymph nodes and distant
sites. If it clearly shows cancer in the
bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride
PET/CT may not be needed. FDG-PET/
CT can be done at the same time as a CT
used for diagnosis.

A biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample
of tissue or fluid. The sample is sent to a lab
for testing. A pathologist will examine the
biopsy for cancer and write a report called a
pathology report. Ask questions about your
biopsy results and what it means for your
treatment.
There are different types of biopsies. Some
biopsies are guided using imaging, such as
mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI. The primary
or main tumor is biopsied first. Other tumors or
tumors in different areas may also be biopsied.
You may have tissue removed from the breast,
lymph nodes, or both.

A FES-PET/CT might be used instead
of FDG-PET/CT when cancer is estrogen
receptor-positive (ER+). FES is a
radioactive form of the hormone estrogen.

Types of possible biopsies include:

A sodium fluoride PET/CT might be
used instead of a bone scan. In this test,
the radiotracer is made of sodium fluoride.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

16

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or
core biopsy (CB) uses needles of
different sizes to remove a sample of
tissue or fluid. In a vacuum-assisted
core biopsy (VACB), suction is used to
remove the sample with a special vacuum
device.

2 Testing for breast cancer » Biopsy





Axillary lymph node needle biopsy

Incisional biopsy removes a small
amount of tissue through a small cut in
the skin or body.

An axillary lymph node (ALN) drains lymph
fluid from the breast and nearby areas. In an
axillary lymph node biopsy, a sample of lymph
node near the armpit (axilla) is biopsied with
a needle. This is to determine if abnormal
lymph nodes seen on imaging tests contain
cancer cells. An ultrasound-guided fine-needle
aspiration (US-FNA) or core biopsy will be
used. If cancer is found, it is called node
positive (node+). A marker may be placed in
the node so that it can be identified later if
needed.

Excisional biopsy removes the entire
abnormal area. This is not the preferred
type of biopsy but may be necessary
if other methods are not possible or
when the biopsy results don’t match the
expected findings.

Before biopsies are performed, usually the
area is injected with numbing medicine. A core
needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one
tissue sample, but usually through the same
area on the breast. The samples are small.
The needle is often guided into the tumor with
imaging. When mammography is used during
a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle
biopsy.

Biopsy results
Histology is the study of the anatomy
(structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under
a microscope. It is used to make treatment
decisions. Your pathology report will contain
information about histology.

One or more clips may be placed near the
breast tumor during a biopsy. The clips are
small, painless, and made of metal. They will
mark the site for future treatment and imaging.
The clips stay in place until surgery. If the area
biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place
to mark the biopsy site on future imaging. The
clips cause no problems, even if they are left
in place for a long time. You will be able to go
through airport security and have an MRI with
the clip(s) in place.

You may be recommended to have an open
biopsy (surgery) to remove (excise) the tumor
to confirm histology. Talk to your health care
provider for more information on next steps.

There are both physical and emotional
experiences in having biopsies. You may need
to rest and place an ice pack on the biopsy
area after the procedure. If you are working
or have other commitments, you may want to
take the day off to rest.

2 Testing for breast cancer » Hormone receptor status

Hormone receptor status

Hormone receptor-positive
In hormone receptor-positive (HR+)
breast cancer, IHC finds estrogen and/or
progesterone hormone receptors. Most breast
cancers are HR+.

Your blood carries hormones throughout your
body. A hormone is a substance made by a
gland in your body. A receptor is a protein
found inside or on the surface of a cell. When
hormones attach (bind) to specific receptors, it
causes changes within the cell.



When hormones attach to receptors inside
breast cancer cells, they can cause cancer
to grow. If found, these receptors may be
targeted using endocrine therapy.


There are 2 types of hormone receptors:




Estrogen – plays a role in breast
development
Progesterone – plays a role in
menstrual cycle and pregnancy

Progesterone receptor (PR) binds
progesterone and provides survival and
proliferation signals. It is thought that PR
expression also suggests the tumor is
estrogen dependent.

HR+ breast cancer is treated with endocrine
therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor
signaling or decreases estrogen production.

Hormone receptor (HR) testing should be done
on any new tumors. A biopsy sample will be
used.

Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)
breast cancer cells

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to cells. These cells are then
studied using a microscope. IHC can find
estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors
in breast cancer cells. A pathologist will
measure how many cells have estrogen and/
or progesterone receptors and the number of
receptors inside each cell.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

Estrogen receptor (ER) is stimulated
by estrogen and provides survival and
proliferation (rapid growth) signals.
Cancer cells deprived of estrogen or
that have their ER signal blocked with
treatment may stop growing or die.

•

In ER+ breast cancer, testing finds
estrogen hormone receptors in at least
1 out of every 100 cancer cells.

•

In ER-low–positive invasive breast
cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone
receptors in 1 to 10 out of every 100
cancer cells.

•

Endocrine therapy might not be
recommended for ER-low–positive
invasive breast cancer.

2 Testing for breast cancer » HER2 status

Hormone receptor-negative
Hormone receptor-negative (HR-) breast
cancer cells do not have either estrogen or
progesterone hormone receptors. These
cancers are sometimes simply called hormone
negative. HR- cancers often grow faster
than HR+ cancers. Both the estrogen and
progesterone receptors need to be negative for
breast cancer to be considered HR-.

Treatment options by cell
receptor type
There are many treatments for invasive
breast cancer. Which ones are right for you
are based on many factors. Two important
factors are the hormone receptor (HR) and
HER2 status of any tumors.

HER2 status
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. It is found on the surface of all cells.
When amounts are high, it causes cells to
grow and divide. Some breast cancers have
too many HER2 genes or receptors. Too many
HER2s is called HER2-positive (HER2+). You
might hear it called HER2 overexpression or
amplification.
There are 2 tests for HER2:




Hormone receptors include estrogen
and progesterone. A tumor is considered
hormone receptor-positive (HR+) if an
increased number of estrogen receptors,
progesterone receptors, or both are
found.

•

HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. There might be higher amounts
of HER2 in your breast cancer. If this
is the case, it is called HER2-positive
(HER2+) breast cancer.

Endocrine therapy stops cancer growth
caused by hormones. It is a standard
treatment for hormone receptor-positive
(HR+) cancers. HR+ cancer can be estrogen
receptor-positive (ER+) and/or progesterone
receptor-positive (PR+).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
measures receptors. If the IHC score is
3+, the cancer is HER2+. If the score is 0
or 1, it is considered HER2-. If the score
is 2+, further testing is needed.
In situ hybridization (ISH) counts the
number of copies of the HER2 gene. This
test is done mainly when the IHC score is
unclear.

HER2-targeted therapy is a standard
treatment for HER2+ cancers.
Chemotherapy is often the first treatment
for hormone receptor-negative (HR-)
cancers.

HER2 testing should be done on all new
tumors. A tumor biopsy sample will be used.
You might have more than one HER2 test.

2 Testing for breast cancer » Biomarker testing

Biomarker testing

Tumor markers
Your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested
for proteins. These proteins are called
tumor markers. Knowing this information
can help plan treatment. Examples of some
tumor markers in breast cancer include
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 15-3, and
CA 27.29. An increase in the level of certain
tumor markers could mean that the cancer has
grown or spread (progressed). However, not
everyone has elevated levels of these markers
and tumor markers alone are not a reliable
method of detecting breast cancer. Therefore,
they are not routinely checked and depend on
your individual situation.

A sample from a biopsy of your tumor
may be tested to look for specific DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations,
protein levels, or other molecular features.
This information is used to choose the best
treatment for you. It is sometimes called
molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor
sequencing, gene expression profiling, or
genomic testing.
Biomarker testing includes tests of genes
or their products (proteins). It identifies
the presence or absence of mutations and
certain proteins that might suggest treatment.
Proteins are written like this: BRCA. Genes are
written with italics like this: BRCA. HER2 and
hormone receptor status are part of biomarker
testing. Your treatment team will recommend
the best types of biomarker testing that are
important for you.
Biomarker testing or mutation testing is more
commonly done in metastatic breast cancer.

Tumor mutation testing
A sample of your tumor or blood may be used
to see if the cancer cells have any specific
DNA mutations. This is a different type of DNA
testing than the genetic testing for mutations
you may have inherited from your biological
parents. In tumor mutation testing, only the
tumor is tested and not the rest of your body.
Certain mutations such as PIK3CA can be
targeted with specific therapies.

2 Testing for breast cancer » Genetic cancer risk testing

Genetic cancer risk testing

What is your family
health history?

About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are
hereditary. Depending on your family history or
other features of your cancer, your health care
provider might refer you for hereditary genetic
testing to learn more about your cancer. A
genetic counselor or trained provider will speak
to you about the results. Test results may be
used to guide treatment planning.

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families—those who are related to you
through genes passed down from biological
parent to child. This information is called
a family health history. Ask blood relatives
about their health issues like heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they
were diagnosed. For relatives who were
diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or other
relatives if they are no longer living) what
type of cancer they had, if they died from
the cancer, and at what age the cancer was
diagnosed.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). The
goal is to look for gene mutations inherited
from your biological parents called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You
can pass these genes on to your children.
Also, other blood relatives might carry these
mutations. Tell your care team if there is a
family history of cancer.

Start by asking your parents, siblings,
and children. Next, talk to half-siblings,
aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews,
grandparents, and grandchildren.

BRCA tests
Everyone has BRCA genes. Normal BRCA
genes help to prevent tumor growth. They help
fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally.
BRCA mutations put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. Mutations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian,
prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma skin
cancers. Mutated BRCA genes can also affect
how well some treatments work. These tests
might be repeated.

Write down what you learn about your
family history and share with your health
care provider.
Some of the questions to ask include:

3 How old were you when each of these
diseases and health conditions was
diagnosed?

3 What is our family’s ancestry—from
what countries did our ancestors
originate?

2 Testing for breast cancer » Distress screening » Performance status

Distress screening

Performance status

It is normal to have strong feelings about being
diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can
also change from day to day and week to
week. Talk to your care team and those whom
you feel most comfortable about how you are
feeling. There are services and people who
can help you. Support and counseling are
available. Many treatment teams include mind
and body therapists who can help.

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be rated
using a PS scale called Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG). PS is one factor
taken into consideration when choosing
a treatment plan. Your preferences about
treatment are always important.
The ECOG PS scores range from 0 to 5.

Dealing with a cancer diagnosis can be
stressful and may cause further distress.
Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You
may also experience depression, anxiety, and
sleep issues. Your treatment team will screen
your level of distress. This is part of your
cancer care.








Your diagnosis of cancer may affect your
family or loved ones. They may feel some
degree of anxiety or depression. They can talk
to the social worker and seek help, too.





More information on distress is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

PS 0 means the person is fully active.
PS 1 means the person is still able to
perform light to moderate activity, but with
some limitations.
PS 2 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed less than half of the time and
still able to care for self.
PS 3 means the person is limited to the
chair or bed more than half of the time.
PS 4 means the person is totally confined
to the bed or chair and completely
disabled.
PS 5 means the person is not alive.

Good PS is usually PS 0 or PS 1.





How breast cancer is
staged



A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging.





Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A
prognosis is the course your cancer will likely
take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

The extent (size) of the tumor (T):
How large is the cancer? Has it grown
into nearby areas?
The spread to nearby lymph nodes
(N): Has the cancer spread to nearby
lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where?
The spread (metastasis) to distant
sites (M): Has the cancer spread to
distant organs such as the lungs or liver?
Estrogen receptor (ER) status: Does
the cancer have the protein called an
estrogen receptor?
Progesterone receptor (PR) status:
Does the cancer have the protein called a
progesterone receptor?
Human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) status: Does the
cancer make too much of a protein called
HER2?
Grade of the cancer (G): How much
do the cancer cells look like normal cells?
Biomarker testing: Does the cancer
have any genes, proteins, markers, or
mutations that might suggest treatment?

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
It takes into account what can be felt during a
physical exam, what can be seen on imaging
tests, and what is found during a biopsy or
surgery. Often, not all information is available
at the initial evaluation. More information can
be gathered as treatment begins.

3 Breast cancer staging » How breast cancer is staged

Staging includes:



specific and accurate details about the size of
the cancer and lymph node status.

Anatomic – based on the extent of
cancer as defined by tumor size (T),
lymph node status (N), and distant
metastasis (M).

Clinical stage
Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before
any treatment. It is based on a physical exam,
biopsy, and imaging tests. An example might
look like cT1 or cN2. In breast cancer, the
clinical stage is based on imaging and biopsy
results. These tests are done before any
treatment as part of an initial diagnosis.

Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM
plus tumor grade and the status of the
biomarkers such as human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen
receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor
(PR). Prognostic stage also includes the
assumption that you are treated with the
standard of care approaches.

Pathologic stage
Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is
determined by examining tissue removed
during surgery. An example might be pN2. If
you are given drug therapy before surgery,
then the stage might add a y and look like
ypT3.

Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and
pathologic. Pathologic stage applies to those
who have undergone surgery as the initial
treatment for breast cancer. Breast cancer
staging is often done twice, before and after
surgery. Staging after surgery provides more

3 Breast cancer staging » TNM scores

T = Tumor

TNM scores

The primary tumor size can be measured in
centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). One
inch is equal to 2.54 cm. A large pea is 1 cm
(10 mm). A golf ball is 4 cm (40 mm). A tumor
micrometastasis is a very small collection of
cancerous cells smaller than 1 mm. It might be
written as T1mi. Ipsilateral means on the same
side of the body.

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is
used to stage breast cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different areas
of cancer growth. Based on cancer test results,
a score or number is assigned to each letter.
The higher the number, the larger the tumor or
the more the cancer has spread. These scores
will be combined to assign the cancer a stage.
A TNM example might look like this: T2N1M0
or T2, N1, M0.








T1 Tumor is 2 cm (20 mm) or less
•

T1mi Tumor is micrometastasis of 1
mm or less

T (tumor) – Depth and spread of the
main (primary) tumor(s) in one or both
breasts

•

T1a Tumor is 1.1 mm to 5 mm

N (node) – If cancer has spread to
nearby (regional) lymph nodes

•

T1b Tumor is 5.1 mm to 10 mm

•

T1c Tumor is 10.1 mm to 20 mm

•

T2 Tumor is 2.1 cm to 5 cm

M (metastasis) – If cancer has
spread to distant parts of the body or
metastasized

3 Breast cancer staging » TNM scores

N = Regional lymph node

M = Metastasis

Lymph, a clear fluid containing cells that help
fight infections and other diseases, drains
through channels into lymphatic vessels. From
here, lymph drains into lymph nodes. Lymph
nodes work as filters to help fight infection.

Cancer that has spread to distant parts of the
body is shown as M1. This is metastatic breast
cancer (MBC). The most common sites for
metastasis are bone and lung.


Regional lymph nodes are those located
near the breast in the armpit (axilla). If breast
cancer spreads, it often goes first to nearby
lymph nodes under the arm. It can also
sometimes spread to lymph nodes near the
collarbone or near the breastbone. However,
it is possible for cancerous cells to travel
through lymph and blood to other parts of the
body without having gone to the lymph nodes
first. Knowing if the cancer has spread to your
lymph nodes helps doctors find the best way to
treat your cancer.








M1 means distant metastasis is found.
This is metastatic breast cancer.

Grade
Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells
look under a microscope (called histology).
Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread
faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means
the grade can’t be determined, followed by G1,
G2, and G3. G3 is the highest grade for breast
cancers.

N0 means no cancer is in the regional
lymph nodes. Isolated tumor cells (ITCs)
may be present. These are malignant cell
clusters no larger than 0.2 mm.
N1mi means micrometastases
(approximately 200 cells, larger than
0.2 mm, but not larger than 2.0 mm) are
found in lymph nodes.
N1, N2, N3 means regional lymph node
metastases are found. The higher the
number, the more lymph nodes that have
metastases.

Numbered stages

Key points

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores
and receptor (hormone and HER2) status.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with
4 being the most advanced. They might be
written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III,
and stage IV.









Stage 0 is noninvasive – Noninvasive
breast cancer is rated stage 0. Ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is found only in
the ducts (Tis). It has not spread to the
surrounding breast tissue, lymph nodes
(N0), or distant sites (M0).







Stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive –
Invasive breast cancer is rated stage 1,
2, or 3. It has grown outside the ducts,
lobules, or breast skin. Cancer might be in
the axillary lymph nodes.



Stage 4 is metastatic – In stage
4 breast cancer, cancer has spread to
distant sites. It can develop from earlier
stages. Sometimes, the first diagnosis is
stage 4 metastatic breast cancer (called
de novo).

4 Treating breast cancer » Treatment overview » Surgery

Treatment overview

Systemic (drug) therapy might be used before
surgery to shrink the tumor or reduce the
amount of cancer (called cancer burden).

Invasive breast cancer is treatable.
Treatment can be local, systemic, or usually a
combination of both.



Local therapy focuses on the breast, chest
wall, and lymph node area. It includes:






Surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, and
lymph node surgery)

The goal of surgery or tumor resection is to
remove all the cancer. To do so, the tumor is
removed along with a rim of normal-looking
tissue around its edge called the surgical
margin.

Systemic therapy works throughout the
body. It includes:

Chemotherapy



HER2-targeted therapy



Inhibitors or other targeted therapies



Immunotherapy



Endocrine therapy

The surgical margin may look normal during
surgery, but cancerous cells may be found
when viewed under a microscope by a
pathologist. In a clear or negative margin (R0),
no cancer cells are found in the tissue around
the edge of the tumor. In a positive margin,
cancer cells are found in normal-looking tissue
around the tumor.

Surgery

After surgery, you may receive treatment such
as radiation to kill any remaining cancer cells.
You might have a wound drain to prevent fluid
from collecting in the body after surgery. These
drains are usually removed a few days after
surgery.

Surgery is an operation or procedure to remove
cancer from the body. Surgery is the main or
primary treatment for invasive breast cancer.
This is only one part of a treatment plan. When
preparing for surgery, seek the opinion of an
experienced surgeon. The surgeon should be
an expert in performing your type of surgery.
Hospitals that perform many surgeries often
have better results. You can ask for a referral to
a hospital or cancer center that has experience
in treating your type of cancer.

Lumpectomy

of your breast, and any concerns you have.
You can also seek the opinion of a plastic
(reconstructive) surgeon.

Lumpectomy is the removal of abnormal cells
or tumor. It does not remove the whole breast.
A lumpectomy is also called breast-conserving
therapy or breast-conserving surgery (BCS).
In a lumpectomy, the surgeon aims to remove
the tumor with a small rim of healthy tissue
around it, called a negative, or clear surgical
margin. Having a negative surgical margin will
decrease the chance that cancer may return
in that area of the breast. You may need more
than one surgery to achieve negative margins
and ensure all the cancer was removed. A
lumpectomy is usually followed by radiation
therapy to part of or the whole breast.

Breastfeeding or chestfeeding
Breastfeeding or chestfeeding following a
lumpectomy may be possible. However, after
treatments, the breast may produce less
milk than before, or none. Breastfeeding/
chestfeeding is not recommended during
active treatment or within 6 months of
completing certain types of endocrine therapy.

The breast might not look the same after a
lumpectomy. Speak to your surgeon about how
a lumpectomy might affect the look and shape

Breast-conserving surgery
The dotted line shows where the
tumor is removed. Lumpectomy is
the removal of abnormal cells or
tumor and not the whole breast. It
is also called a partial mastectomy,
breast-conserving therapy, or
breast-conserving surgery (BCS).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

34

4 Treating breast cancer » Mastectomy

Mastectomy



A mastectomy is surgery to remove all of the
breast. Underarm sentinel lymph nodes might
be removed. Before removing the breast, the
surgeon may do a sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB). Sentinel lymph nodes are the first
lymph nodes cancer cells are likely to have
spread from the primary tumor.

Breast reconstruction is an option after a
mastectomy. It might be done at the same
time as mastectomy (immediate) or at some
time following the completion of cancer
treatment (delayed). Breast reconstruction
is most commonly done in stages. If you are
considering breast reconstruction surgery,
it requires collaboration between a breast
surgeon and a reconstructive (plastic) surgeon.

Types of mastectomies include the following:




A total mastectomy or simple
mastectomy is a surgery that removes
the whole breast with an aesthetic flat
skin closure.
A skin-sparing mastectomy removes
the breast but not all the skin, in order

4 Treating breast cancer » Lymph node surgery

Lymph node surgery

If the axillary nodes are removed with
the breast, it is called a modified radical
mastectomy.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB or SNB) is
done during a lumpectomy or mastectomy to
determine if any cancer cells have traveled to
the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes removed
are called the sentinel nodes.

There are 3 levels of axillary lymph nodes:




A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph
node or nodes that cancer cells are most likely
to spread to from a primary tumor. Often, there
is more than one sentinel lymph node. Just
because these nodes are removed, it does not
mean that they test positive for cancer.



Level II – nodes located underneath the
chest muscle
Level III – nodes located above the
chest muscle near the collarbone

An ALND usually removes level I and II axillary
lymph nodes. For more information about the
timing of biopsies, talk with your care team.

To find the sentinel lymph nodes, a dye is
injected into the breast. It may be a radioactive
material, blue dye, or other tracer. The tracer
travels through the lymph channels in the
breast to the lymph nodes in the armpit.
This helps the surgeon find which of the
lymph nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes.
The lymph nodes containing the tracer are
removed and tested by a pathologist.

Axillary lymph node dissection
Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is
surgery to remove axillary lymph nodes. This is
performed after an axillary lymph node biopsy
or SLNB shows cancer in the lymph nodes
(called node positive). Then, an ALND will
remove any other lymph nodes that contain
cancer. Removing lymph nodes can cause
lymphedema and other health issues.

4 Treating breast cancer » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

breast (intramammary), behind the ribcage
(internal mammary), or axillary bed (armpit).

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays (photons), protons, and
other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink
tumors. Radiation therapy can be given alone
or before or after surgery to treat or slow the
growth of cancer. Sometimes, radiation is
given with certain systemic (drug) therapies.
It may be used as supportive care to help
ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer.
Most types of radiation include several short
treatment sessions that are given once daily
over a few days to weeks. Ask your care team
which radiation option(s) are best for you and
what side effects to expect.

External beam radiation therapy
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body called a linear
accelerator to aim radiation at the whole breast
(WBRT), only the tumor area of the breast
(PBI), and lymph nodes (RNI).

Internal radiation
Internal radiation (brachytherapy) involves
placing one or more small tubes into the tumor
area of the breast. A small radioactive seed
travels into the tube(s) and delivers radiation
to the tumor area of the breast from inside the
body. This type of radiation is used only for PBI.

The following are types of radiation therapy
used to treat breast cancer:






Whole breast radiation therapy
(WBRT) is used to treat the entire breast.
Sometimes, additional treatments may be
given to the tumor area. This is called a
boost.
Partial breast irradiation (PBI)
is used to treat only the tumor area of
the breast. Accelerated partial breast
irradiation (APBI) is radiation given over a
shorter period of time.
Lymph node radiation therapy is
used to treat the lymph nodes. It is also
called regional nodal irradiation (RNI).

Radiation may be given to the breast and
chest wall, infraclavicular region (below the
collarbone), supraclavicular area (above the
collarbone), lymph nodes found inside the

Did you know?

There are many treatment options. Many
factors play a role in how the cancer will
respond to treatment. It is important to have
regular talks with your care team about your
goals for treatment and your treatment plan.

Chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
immunotherapy, and endocrine
therapy are types of systemic
therapy.

For systemic therapy examples, see

4 Treating breast cancer » Chemotherapy » Antibody drug conjugates

Chemotherapy



Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. More than one
chemotherapy may be used to treat invasive
breast cancer. When only one drug is used,
it’s called a single agent. A combination or
multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more
chemotherapy drugs.

Most chemotherapy is given in cycles of
treatment days followed by days of rest.
This allows the body to recover before the
next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending
on which drugs are used. The number of
treatment days per cycle and the total number
of cycles given also vary.

Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are
infused into a vein or injected under the skin
with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs may
be given as a pill that is swallowed.

Antibody drug conjugates
An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) delivers
cell-specific chemotherapy. It attaches to a
protein found on the outside of the cancer
cell, then enters the cell. Once inside the cell,
chemotherapy is released. Ado-trastuzumab
emtansine (Kadcyla) and fam-trastuzumab
deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu) attach to HER2.
Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (Trodelvy)
attaches to Trop-2.

Some examples of chemotherapy drugs
include the following:




Anthracyclines include doxorubicin and
epirubicin.
Taxanes include docetaxel, paclitaxel,
and albumin-bound paclitaxel.

Standard of care is the best-known way
to treat a particular disease based on
past clinical trials. There may be more
than one treatment regimen that is
considered standard of care. Ask your
care team what treatment options are
available and if a clinical trial might be
right for you.

HER2-targeted therapy

Other targeted therapies

HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell
growth. There might be higher amounts of
HER2 in your breast cancer. If this is the case,
it is called HER2-positive (HER2+) breast
cancer. HER2-targeted therapy is drug therapy
that treats HER2+ breast cancer. Some HER2targeted therapy is given with chemotherapy.
However, it might be used alone or in
combination with endocrine therapy.

PARP inhibitors

HER2-targeted therapies include:

Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a cell
protein that helps cells grow and divide. For
hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2negative cancer, taking a CDK4/6 inhibitor with
endocrine therapy may help control cancer
longer and improve survival. With all CDK4/6
regimens, those who are premenopausal must
also receive ovarian ablation or suppression.
CDK4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib
(Verzenio), palbociclib (Ibrance), and ribociclib
(Kisqali).







Cancer cells often become damaged. PARP
is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells and
allows them to survive. Blocking PARP can
cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib (Lynparza)
and talazoparib (Talzenna) are PARP inhibitors.

CDK4/6 inhibitors

HER2 antibodies prevent HER2 growth
signals from outside the cell. They also
increase the attack of immune cells on
cancer cells.
HER2 inhibitors stop HER2 growth
signals from within the cell.
HER2 conjugates or HER2 antibody
drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver
cell-specific chemotherapy. They attach
directly to HER2s then enter the cell.
Once inside, chemotherapy is released.

Immunotherapy

Your heart will be monitored before and
during treatment with HER2-targeted therapy.
Tests will measure the left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF), the amount of blood pumping
from the left side of the heart.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment
that increases or turns on the activity of your
immune system. By doing so, it improves
your body’s ability to find and destroy cancer
cells. Immunotherapy can be given alone or
with other types of treatment. Pembrolizumab
(Keytruda) may be given with chemotherapy
for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer.

41

4 Treating breast cancer » Endocrine therapy

Endocrine therapy

There are 4 hormones that might be targeted
in endocrine therapy:

Hormones may cause breast cancer to
grow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body
from making hormones or it will block what
hormones do in the body. This can help to
reduce the risk of cancer returning. See





Guide 3.

The endocrine system is made up of organs
and tissues that produce hormones. Hormones
are natural chemicals released into the
bloodstream.



Estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries,
but also made by other tissues in the
body such as fat tissue.
Progesterone is made mainly by the
ovaries.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) is made by a part
of the brain called the hypothalamus. It
tells the ovaries to make estrogen and
progesterone and testicles to make
testosterone. LHRH is also called
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).

Guide 3
Endocrine therapy types
Bilateral oophorectomy

Surgery to remove both ovaries.

Ovarian ablation

Radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones.

Ovarian or testosterone
suppression

Drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries or testicles from making
hormones such as LHRH and GnRH.

Aromatase inhibitors
(AIs)

Drugs to stop a type of hormone called androgen from changing
into estrogen by interfering with an enzyme called aromatase.
Nonsteroidal AIs include anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole
(Femara). Exemestane (Aromasin) is a steroidal AI.

Estrogen receptor (ER)
modulators

• Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) block
estrogen from attaching to hormone receptors. Tamoxifen and
toremifene (Fareston) are SERMs.
• Selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) block and
destroy estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) and elacestrant
(Orserdu) are SERDs.

Hormones

Hormone examples include ethinyl estradiol, fluoxymesterone, and
megestrol acetate (Megace).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

42

4 Treating breast cancer » Endocrine therapy



Androgen is made by the adrenal
glands, testicles, and ovaries.

Endocrine therapy will suppress the production
of hormones and affect one's ability to become
pregnant during treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist before starting endocrine
therapy.

Endocrine therapy is sometimes called
hormone therapy. It is not the same as
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) used for
menopause.

Testosterone

Types of endocrine therapy that might be used
for invasive breast cancer:










For those assigned male at birth whose bodies
continue to make testosterone, endocrine
therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase
inhibitor with testosterone-suppressing therapy.

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) stop a
type of hormone called androgen from
changing into estrogen by interfering with
an enzyme called aromatase. They do
not affect estrogen made by the ovaries.
Nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors include
anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole
(Femara). Exemestane (Aromasin) is a
steroidal aromatase inhibitor.

Premenopause
If you have menstrual periods and still
have a uterus, you are in premenopause.
In premenopause, the ovaries are the main
source of estrogen and progesterone.
Menstrual periods may stop during treatment
and for up to 2 years after treatment, but often
return in those 35 years of age and under.

Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators
or anti-estrogens prevent hormones from
binding to receptors.
Selective estrogen receptor
modulators (SERMs) block estrogen
from attaching to hormone receptors.
They include tamoxifen and toremifene
(Fareston).



Selective estrogen receptor
degraders (SERDs) block and
destroy estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant
(Faslodex) and elacestrant (Orserdu) are
SERDs.

Menopause
In menopause, the ovaries permanently stop
producing hormones and menstrual periods
stop. Estrogen and progesterone levels are
low, but the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat
continue to make small amounts of estrogen.
If you don’t have periods, a test using a blood
sample may be used to confirm your status.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) agonists might be used
to suppress ovarian hormone or
testosterone production.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Invasive Breast Cancer, 2024

Tamoxifen is the endocrine treatment
option for those in premenopause.
Ovarian suppression or ablation is
frequently considered for higher-risk ER+
breast cancers.

43

4 Treating breast cancer » Bone-strengthening therapy

Cancer treatment can cause temporary
menopause. If you stopped having periods due
to removal of your uterus (hysterectomy) but
you still have your ovaries, then you should
have your menopausal status confirmed
with a blood test. If both ovaries have been
removed (with or without your uterus), you are
in menopause.




You will be screened for bone weakness
(osteoporosis) using a bone mineral density
test. This measures how much calcium and
other minerals are in your bones. It is also
called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DEXA) scan and is painless. Bone mineral
density tests look for osteoporosis and help
predict your risk for bone fractures.

Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor
is the endocrine treatment for those in
menopause. Aromatase inhibitors include
anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane
(Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara).

A baseline DEXA scan is recommended before
starting endocrine therapy.

Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and
denosumab

Bone-strengthening therapy

Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab
are used to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis)
and fractures. You might have blood tests to
monitor kidney function, calcium levels, and
magnesium levels. A calcium and vitamin D
supplement will be recommended by your
doctor.

Medicines that target the bones may be given
to help relieve bone pain or reduce the risk
of bone problems. Some medicines work by
slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while
others help increase bone thickness.
When breast cancer spreads to distant sites,
it may metastasize in your bones. This puts
your bones at risk for injury and disease. Such
problems include bone loss (osteoporosis),
fractures, bone pain, and squeezing
(compression) of the spinal cord. Some
treatments for breast cancer, like aromatase
inhibitors or GnRH agonists, can cause bone
loss, which puts you at an increased risk for
fractures.

Let your dentist know if you are taking any of
these medicines. Also, ask your care team
how these medicines might affect your teeth
and jaw. Osteonecrosis, or bone tissue death
of the jaw, is a rare but serious side effect. Tell
your care team about any planned trips to the
dentist and surgeries or dental procedures
that might also affect the jawbone. It will be
important to take care of your teeth and to see
a dentist before starting treatment with any of
these drugs.

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

4 Treating breast cancer » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
Rarely. It depends on the study, your health
insurance, and the state in which you live. Your
treatment team and the research team can help
determine if you are responsible for any costs.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Supportive care

Supportive care resources

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to
prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to
improve quality of life. Supportive care might
include pain relief, palliative care, emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you are
feeling and about any side effects so they can
be managed. Supportive care, best supportive
care, and palliative care often mean the same
thing.

More information on supportive care is
available at: NCCN.org/patientguidelines

Cancer app.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant.

treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects.

Blood clots
Cancer or cancer treatment can cause blood
clots to form. This can block blood flow and
oxygen in the body. Blood clots can break
loose and travel to other parts of the body
causing stroke or other health issues. Venous
thromboembolism (VTE) refers to blood clots
in the veins.

Keep a pain diary
A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

Bone health
Breast cancer may spread to your bones.
Some breast cancer treatments may also
weaken your bones. Both can put your bones
at increased risk for injury and disease. Such
problems include bone fractures, bone pain,
and squeezing (compression) of the spinal
cord. High levels of calcium in the blood, called
hypercalcemia, may also occur.

Include in your pain diary:

3 The time and dose of all medicines
3 When pain starts and ends or lessens
3 Where you feel pain
3 A description of your pain. Is it

throbbing, sharp, tingling, shooting, or
burning? Is it constant, or does it come
and go?

Medicine may be given to help relieve bone
pain and reduce the risk of other bone
problems. Some medicines work by slowing or
stopping bone breakdown, while others help
increase bone thickness. It is recommended
that you take calcium and vitamin D with these
bone health medicines. Talk to your care team
first.

3 Does the pain change at different times

Hair loss
Chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia)
all over your body — not just on your scalp.
Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely
than others to cause hair loss. Dosage might
also affect the amount of hair loss. Most of
the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is
temporary. Hair often regrows 3 to 6 months
after treatment ends. Your hair may be a
different shade or texture. Scalp cooling
(or scalp hypothermia) might help lessen
hair loss in those receiving certain types of
chemotherapy.

Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or other treatments might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
Healthy eating is important during treatment.
It includes eating a balanced diet, eating the
right amount of food, and drinking enough
fluids. A registered dietitian who is an expert in
nutrition and food can help. Speak to your care
team if you have trouble eating or maintaining
your weight.

Distress

Low blood cell counts

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about

Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration, memory, and thinking. Survivors
are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be
recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of
your brain affects your thinking and behavior.
Neuropsychological testing can identify your
limits and a health care professional can
create a plan to help with these limits.

Neuropathy
Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets

to keep any follow-up doctor visits and
imaging test appointments. Seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

A personalized survivorship care plan will
contain a summary of possible long-term
effects of treatment called late effects and a list
of follow-up tests. Find out how your primary
care provider will coordinate with specialists for
your follow-up care.

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

Tell your care team about any symptoms
such as headaches, menstrual spotting
between periods or new onset of spotting after
menopause (if prior tamoxifen), shortness of
breath that you notice with walking, or bone
pain. Side effects can be managed. Continue
to take all medicine such as endocrine therapy
exactly as prescribed and do not miss or skip
doses.

heart or blood pressure medicine, and
antidepressants are just some of the
medicines that might interact with a
systemic therapy or supportive care

Some breast cancers grow because of
estrogen. These cancers are estrogen
receptor-positive (ER+) and are often
treated with endocrine therapy to reduce
the risk of cancer recurrence.

A clinical trial is a type of research that
studies a treatment to see how safe it is
and how well it works.
Supportive care is health care that
relieves symptoms caused by treatment
and improves quality of life. Supportive
care is always given.
All cancer treatments can cause
unwanted health issues called side
effects. It is important for you to tell your
care team about all your side effects so
they can be managed.
Eating a balanced diet, drinking enough
fluids, and exercise can help manage side

choose a treatment plan that is
best for you.

A lumpectomy, also called breast-conserving
surgery (BCS), is surgery to remove a tumor
in the breast. Treatment after a lumpectomy
is based on the type of cancer and if cancer
is found in the axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). If
there is a positive surgical margin, you might
have more surgery to remove any remaining
cancer. A lumpectomy is usually followed by
radiation therapy (RT) to part of or the whole
breast and sometimes the lymph nodes. A
boost is extra radiation to the tumor area.
Chemotherapy might be given before RT.

Not all cancers need treatment before surgery.
This chapter is for those who will have surgery
first.

Surgery with radiation
therapy
Surgery is the main or primary treatment for
invasive breast cancer. It involves removing
the tumor from the breast and assessing the
lymph nodes.

Total mastectomy followed by
radiation therapy
A total mastectomy is a surgery that
removes the whole breast. Treatment after a
mastectomy is based on if cancer was found in
the axillary lymph nodes (ALNs), the number of
lymph nodes that tested positive, and the size
of the removed tumor. Radiation therapy and/
or systemic therapy are possible following a
mastectomy.

There are 2 breast surgery options:

Lumpectomy



Total mastectomy

Both options include axillary lymph node
(ALN) staging with either sentinel lymph
node biopsy (SLNB), axillary lymph node
dissection (ALND), or both. After surgery, a
pathologist will examine the removed tissue
and any lymph nodes to determine the
pathologic stage. This information will help
plan next steps for treatment. Treatment after

Favorable histology types include:

Adjuvant systemic therapy is drug treatment
after surgery or radiation therapy. It is given
to kill any remaining cancer cells and to help
reduce the risk of cancer returning. This
treatment is based on cancer subtype called
tumor histology and hormone receptor (HR)
status. Histology is the study of the anatomy
(structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under
a microscope. Depending on the histology,
HER2 status may also be a factor. If cancer
is hormone receptor-positive (ER+ and/or
PR+) and HER2-, then oncologists also take
into account if there is cancer in lymph nodes
called node positive (node+).

For those in menopause (natural or induced)
with high-risk node-negative or node-positive
tumors, bone-strengthening therapy might be
given to reduce the risk of distant metastasis.

Favorable histologies
A favorable histology is one that has a
favorable or good prognosis. A prognosis is
the course your cancer will likely take. These
tumor types are not high grade, are HER2-,
and might respond better to treatment than
other tumors. They also might have less risk of
returning. Ask your care team what this might
mean for your treatment. Those with estrogen
receptor-positive (ER+) and/or progesterone
receptor-positive (PR+) tumors will likely have
endocrine therapy as listed in Guide 6. Other
systemic therapies are possible.

In hormone receptor-positive (HR+) cancer,
estrogen (ER+) and/or progesterone receptors
(PR+) are found. Endocrine therapy is used
to treat HR+ breast cancer. Since the tumor is
HER2-, therapy targeting HER2 is not used.
Sometimes, chemotherapy is used instead.

5 Surgery first » Triple-negative breast cancer » Endocrine therapy

Triple-negative breast
cancer

Endocrine therapy
Endocrine therapy is used to treat hormone
receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. This
is cancer that tests positive for estrogen
receptors (ER+) and/or progesterone receptors
(PR+). Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen and
progesterone, which can slow tumor growth or
shrink the tumor for a period of time. It might
also help prevent the risk of cancer returning in
the breasts and elsewhere in the body.

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),
receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and
HER2 are not found. This means that the
breast cancer cells have tested negative for
HER2 and both hormone receptors. It is written
as ER- and/or PR- with HER2-.
TNBC is cancer that is:







Estrogen receptor-negative (ER-),
Progesterone receptor-negative (PR-),
and



HER2-negative (HER2-).

There are many variations within TNBC. It
is a group of diseases that we are learning
more about all the time. Since there are no
HER2 receptors, HER2- targeted therapy is
not used. And since there are no estrogen or
progesterone hormone receptors, endocrine
therapy is not used.



Those with high-risk breast cancer that
is HR+ and HER2- might have 2 years
of adjuvant abemaciclib with endocrine
therapy.
Those receiving an aromatase inhibitor
who are at risk for osteoporosis will
likely have bone density tests and bonestrengthening therapy.

Endocrine therapy options can be found in

Guide 5.

Treatment after surgery (adjuvant) will likely be
chemotherapy as found in Guide 6.

Surgery
Surgery options depend on how your cancer
responded to preoperative therapy. A complete
response means there is no evidence of
cancer. In a partial response, the tumor in the
breast or lymph nodes has shrunk in size.
A lumpectomy or mastectomy are options
depending on the size and location of the
tumor, as well as the size of your breast before
surgery. After surgery, most will have both
systemic therapy and radiation therapy.

If the tumor shrinks or the cancer burden
is reduced, then surgery might be
possible. Options are a lumpectomy or

lymph node (ALN) staging. After surgery,
a pathologist will examine the removed
tissue and any lymph nodes to determine
the pathologic stage. Systemic therapy

Treatment after surgery
Order of treatments

Many people have treatment after surgery.
Treatment after surgery is called adjuvant
therapy. Adjuvant therapy is based on the
size of the tumor, if cancer remains (residual
disease), and if cancer in the lymph nodes is
found. A complete response means there is no
evidence of cancer.

Most people with cancer will receive more
than one type of treatment. Below is an
overview of the order of treatments.

3 Preoperative or neoadjuvant

(before) therapy is given to shrink
the tumor before a primary treatment
such as surgery.

Your tumor will be restaged after preoperative
therapy. Staging will be done by looking at
tissue removed during surgery. This is called
the pathologic stage or surgical stage. It might
look like this: ypT0N0. The y means you had
preoperative therapy.

3 Perioperative therapy is systemic

therapy, such as chemotherapy, given
before and after surgery.

3 Primary treatment is the main

Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) cancer is
often treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy.
HER2-targeted therapy is often used to treat
HER2+ cancer. Systemic therapies might
be used alone or in combination. When
chemotherapy is used, it is given before
endocrine therapy. Ask your medical oncologist
why one treatment might be preferred over
another for your type of cancer.

treatment given to rid the body of
cancer.

3 Postoperative or adjuvant (after)

therapy is given after primary
treatment to rid the body of any cancer
cells left behind from surgery. It is also
used when the risk of cancer returning
(recurrence) is felt to be high.

For those in menopause (natural or induced)
with high-risk node-negative (node-) or nodepositive (node+) tumors, bone-strengthening
therapy might be given to reduce the risk of
distant metastasis.

3 First-line therapy is the first set of
systemic (drug) treatment given.

3 Second-line therapy is the next set

of treatment given if cancer progresses
during or after systemic therapy.

Adjuvant treatment options based on HR and
HER2 status are described on the following
pages.

Triple-negative breast
cancer

Endocrine therapy options can be found in

Guide 9.

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the
tumor has tested negative for HER2, estrogen
receptors, and progesterone receptors. It is
written as ER- and/or PR- with HER2-. This
cancer does not respond to endocrine therapy
or HER2-targeted therapy. It is treated with
chemotherapy and other systemic therapies
found in Guide 10.




Follow-up care
After treatment, you will enter follow-up care.
During this time, your health will be monitored
for side effects of treatment and the possible
return of cancer called recurrence. This is part
of your survivorship care plan. It is important to
keep any follow-up doctor visits and imaging
test appointments and seek good routine
medical care, including regular doctor visits for
preventive care and cancer screening.

If no disease remains after
preoperative therapy and you are at high
risk for the return of cancer, then you will
have pembrolizumab (if a pembrolizumabcontaining regimen was given before
surgery).

Tell your care team about any symptoms
such as headaches or bone pain. Side
effects can be managed. Continue to take all
medicine such as endocrine therapy exactly as
prescribed and do not miss or skip doses.

If disease remains or there
is cancer in the lymph nodes
(node positive), then you will have
capecitabine. Olaparib might be given
if a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation was
found. Pembrolizumab is an option if a
pembrolizumab-containing regimen was
given before surgery.

You should receive a personalized survivorship
care plan. It will provide a summary of possible
long-term effects of treatment and a list of
follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care
provider will coordinate with specialists for your
follow-up care.

Endocrine therapy

Follow-up care can be found in Guide 11.

Endocrine therapy is used to treat hormone
receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. This
is cancer that tests positive for estrogen
receptors (ER+) and/or progesterone receptors
(PR+). Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen and
progesterone to treat HR+ breast cancer. This
can slow tumor growth or shrink the tumor for
a period of time. It might also help prevent the
risk of cancer returning. Endocrine therapy is
often used with other systemic therapies.

Treatment before surgery is called
preoperative (neoadjuvant) therapy. It can
be systemic therapy or radiation therapy.
The goal of treatment is to shrink the
tumor before surgery.

Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.

Systemic therapy after surgery is called
adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy is
based on how the tumor responded to
preoperative treatment.

Take our survey to let us know
what we got right and what we
could do better.

All treatment is based on HER2 and
hormone receptor (HR) status.
In hormone receptor-positive (HR+)
breast cancer, tests find hormone
receptors for estrogen and/or
progesterone on the tumor.
HR+ breast cancer is treated with
endocrine therapy.
HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is
treated with HER2-targeted therapy.
It is important to keep follow-up visits
and imaging test appointments. Seek
good routine medical care, including
preventative care and cancer screenings.
Continue to take all medicines as

before surgery. This chapter offers
more information on volume
displacement, flat closure, and
breast reconstruction.

Flat closure

The recovery time for each procedure differs.
This can affect your ability to return to work
or participate in activities. You might consider
speaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery
to discuss your options and what to expect.

In a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the
entire breast, including nipple, extra skin,
fat, and other tissue in the breast area, is
removed. The remaining skin is tightened
and sewn together. No breast mound is
created, and no implant is added. The scar
will be slightly raised and differ in color than
the surrounding skin. A flat closure is not
completely flat or smooth. The result varies
from person to person. Ask to look at pictures
from flat closures so you know what to expect.

Volume displacement
With a lumpectomy, most people have a
scar with some volume loss. However, if you
need a large lumpectomy and your surgeon
thinks your breast will look more abnormal
afterwards, your breast may be able to be reshaped at the time of surgery. This procedure
is called volume displacement or oncoplasty.
Only a limited number of cancer centers
perform this procedure. It is often done by the
cancer surgeon or plastic surgeon right after
the lumpectomy. The surgeon will shift the

7 The breast after surgery » Breast reconstruction

Breast reconstruction

Implants
Breast implants are small bags filled with salt
water, silicone gel, or both. They are placed
under the breast skin or muscle to look like a
new breast following a mastectomy. A balloonlike device, called an expander, may be used
first to stretch out tissue. It will be placed under
your skin or muscle and enlarged every few
weeks for 2 to 3 months. When your skin is
stretched to the proper size, you will have
surgery to place the final implant.

Breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild
the shape and look of the breast after
a mastectomy. In many cases, breast
reconstruction involves a staged approach. It
might require more than one procedure.
You may have a choice as to when
breast reconstruction is done. Immediate
reconstruction is finished within hours after
removing the breast. Delayed reconstruction
can occur months or years after the cancer
surgery. Reconstruction can also be done in a
staged fashion, with part of the reconstruction
done at the time of the original cancer surgery
and finished with another surgery later. A
plastic surgeon performs breast reconstruction.

Implants have a small risk of leaking or
causing other issues. You may feel pain from
the implant or expander. Scar tissue or tissue
death can occur.

Breasts can be reconstructed with implants
and flaps. All methods are generally safe,
but as with any surgery, there are risks. Ask
your treatment team for a complete list of side
effects.

Take care of yourself. This
is a stressful time. Seek out
support groups at your local
hospital, through social
media, or from those listed
in the back of this book.
Look to friends, relatives,
neighbors, and coworkers
for social support.

7 The breast after surgery » Nipple replacement

Flaps

Nipple replacement

Sometimes breast fullness can be recreated
after a skin-sparing mastectomy. In a skinsparing mastectomy, breast tissue is removed
from underneath the skin. The nipple remains
intact, if possible. The remaining skin flaps are
used to create a breast mound. This technique
does not use implants or skin transferred from
other parts of the body and may be completed
in a single surgery. This technique, called a
Goldilocks mastectomy, is best suited for those
with larger breasts who are willing to have
much smaller breasts as a result.

Like your breast, a nipple can be remade. To
rebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use
surrounding tissues. Also, nipples can be
remade with tissue from the thigh or other
nipple. Tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to
look more like a nipple. It is important to note
that while you can remake something to look
like a nipple, it will not have the sensation of
your real nipple. Also, a tattoo can be done to
look like a nipple without having to take tissue
from another part of the body.

Breasts can be remade using tissue from other
parts of your body, known as flaps. These flaps
are taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh,
or from under the shoulder blade. Some flaps
are completely removed and then sewn in
place. Other flaps stay attached to your body
but are slid over and sewn into place.
There are several risks associated with flaps,
including death of fat in the flap, which can
cause lumps. A hernia may result from muscle
weakness. Problems are more likely to occur
among those who have diabetes or who smoke.

Implants and flaps
Some breasts are reconstructed with both
implants and flaps. This method may give the
reconstructed breast more volume to match
the other breast. For any reconstruction, you
may need surgery on your remaining breast to
match the two breasts in size and shape.

What to consider

Key points

Some things to consider when deciding
to have flat closure or reconstruction after
mastectomy:














Your desire – You may have a strong
feeling towards flat closure or one form
of reconstruction after being given the
options. Breast reconstruction should be
a shared decision between you and your
care team. Make your wishes known.



Health issues – You may have health
issues such as diabetes or a blood
disorder that might affect or delay healing,
or make longer procedures unsafe.





Tobacco use – Smoking delays wound
healing and can cause mastectomy flap
death (necrosis), nipple-areola complex
(NAC) necrosis in a nipple-sparing
mastectomy, infection, and failure of
implant-based reconstruction. In free flap
reconstruction, smoking increases the risk
of complications. You are encouraged to
stop smoking prior to reconstruction.
Breast size and shape – There are
limits to the available sizes of breast
implants. Very large breasts or breasts
that lack tone or droop (called ptosis)
might be difficult to match. Breast
reduction surgery might be an option.
Body mass index (BMI) – Those with
an elevated BMI have an increased risk of
infections and complications with breast
reconstruction.

Volume displacement is a shifting of the
breast tissue to fill the space left by a

Breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild
the shape and look of the breast.
Breasts that are fully removed in a
mastectomy can be remade with breast
implants, flaps, or both.
Removed nipples can be remade with
body tissue and/or tattooing.

receive systemic therapy or RT if surgery is not
possible.

Treatment is based on where the cancer has
returned and what type of treatment you had
before. Surgery followed by radiation therapy
(RT) and systemic therapy are possible.
Systemic and endocrine therapy options will
be based on tumor hormone receptor (HR)
status, HER2 status, and previous treatments
given during your initial cancer treatment.
Supportive care will be given. Supportive care
aims to relieve side effects such as pain and to
improve quality of life.

Unresectable
An unresectable tumor cannot be removed
with surgery. It is treated with systemic therapy.
For treatment of unresectable recurrent
disease, see NCCN Guidelines for Patients:
Metastatic Breast Cancer, available at NCCN.
org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Local recurrence
Treatment for cancer that has returned to
the same breast as before is based on if
your first treatment was breast-conserving
surgery (lumpectomy) with radiation therapy
or a mastectomy with or without radiation
therapy (RT). More surgery might be an option.
However, if you had RT before, then it may not
be possible to have it again in the same area.
Systemic and endocrine therapy options will be
based on what you had before.

Regional recurrence
If the recurrence is in or near the armpit
(axilla), then surgery to remove the tumor
might be an option before RT. Systemic
therapy might be given before surgery to help
reduce the disease burden.

This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!
