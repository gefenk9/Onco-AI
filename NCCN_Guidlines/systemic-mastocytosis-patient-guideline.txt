Basics

Blood

Mastocytosis is a rare disorder that
occurs when there are too many mast
cells built up in your body. Mast cells
are a type of white blood cell located all
over your body. This chapter will provide
an overview of the disease.

Blood
Blood is made up of red blood cells, platelets,
plasma, and white blood cells. Plasma is the
largest part of your blood. Plasma is made up
of mostly water. Blood cells float in plasma.
Blood takes oxygen and nutrients to your
body’s tissues, and carries away wastes.

Red blood cells (RBCs)



White blood cells (WBCs)



Platelets (PLTs)

Protection - White blood cells attack and
destroy invading germs (bacteria) and
other pathogens. Blood clots form after an
injury, which protects the body from losing
too much blood.

Mast cells also have other important functions.
They help heal wounds, grow bone, and form
new blood vessels. Mast cells are made in the
bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongey
substance found in the middle of your bones.

Blood has many functions, they include:
Transportation - Blood takes oxygen
from the lungs to the cells of the body.
It takes carbon dioxide from the body’s
cells to the lungs where it is breathed out.
Blood also carries nutrients, hormones,
and waste products around the body.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Systemic Mastocytosis, 2022



Mast cells are a type of white blood cell
found all over your body. They are part of
your immune system. If bacteria or a virus is
found, mast cells help the immune system to
fight the infection (releasing a chemical called
histamine). Histamine causes your blood
vessels to expand and your skin to get itchy
and swollen. It can also create a buildup of
mucus, which makes the airways narrow. This
response is used to protect your body from
infections.

Blood cells do not live forever. Normal red
blood cells live for 3 months. Normal white
blood cells live for 8 to 14 days. Normal
platelets live for about 1 week (7 days). After
cells reach these ages, they die off and are
replaced by new cells. Your blood cells are
being replaced in your body all the time.



Regulation - Blood helps to keep the
acid-alkali balance of the body in check.
It also plays a part in regulating body
temperature. Increasing the amount of
blood flowing close to the skin helps the
body to lose heat.

Mast cells

There are 3 types of blood cells:

Basics

Mastocytosis

Mastocytosis

Because cutaneous mastocytosis is
limited to the skin, it is often treated with
antihistamines and topical creams.

Mastocytosis occurs when too many mast
cells build up in your skin or organs such as
the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and small
intestines. When the mast cells are triggered
they release substances similar to an allergic
reaction. Sometimes, the reaction can cause
severe inflammation that may result in organ
damage.



There are two main forms of mastocytosis,
they include:


Cutaneous - cutaneous mastocytosis
affects the skin only. It occurs most
often in children. During cutaneous
mastocytosis, mast cells build up in the
skin, causing red or brown lesions that
itch. While cutaneous mastocytosis isn’t
life-threatening, it can cause a severe
allergic reaction, which can be fatal.

Mast cell releasing
histamine
Mast cells are a type
of white blood cell.
Histamine is released
from mast cells in
response to an allergen,
causing an allergic
reaction.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Systemic Mastocytosis, 2022

Systemic - Systemic mastocytosis affects
parts of the body other than the skin. It
often occurs in adults. During systemic
mastocytosis, mast cells accumulate in
the bone marrow and organs (such as the
intestines). If the systemic mastocytosis
is aggressive (forms, grows, or spreads
quickly), it can be life-threatening.
Systemic mastocytosis includes two rare
forms, mast cell leukemia and mast cell
sarcoma. This book will focus on systemic
mastocytosis.

Basics

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms

Subtypes

Systemic mastocytosis is broken up into
subtypes.


Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM)
- A benign form of systemic mastocytosis.
It refers to an abnormal accumulation of
mast cells mainly in the bone marrow, but
also in other organs or skin.



Smoldering systemic mastocytosis
(SSM) - A rare, slow to progress form of
systemic mastocytosis (SM). It refers to
a gradual buildup of mast cells in your
internal organs.





Symptoms of mastocytosis differ. They are
based on the part of the body that is affected.
Some people may experience severe
symptoms that last anywhere from 15 to 30
minutes, others may not have any problems.
Symptoms of mastocytosis are more likely to
occur if “triggered”.
Common triggers include:


Alcohol



Surgery

Aggressive systemic mastocytosis
(ASM) - A loss of organ function (usually
liver, gastrointestinal [GI] tract, bone, or
bone marrow) due to mast cells getting in.



Spicy foods



Exercise



Insect stings

Systemic mastocytosis with an
associated hematologic neoplasm
(SM-AHN) - Too many mast cells
build up in certain tissues and organs,
damaging them. Systemic mastocytosis
with associated hematologic neoplasm
refers to a mast cell buildup that occurs
together with another blood disorder,
usually a myelodysplastic syndrome,
myeloproliferative disorder, or acute
myeloid leukemia (AML).



Certain medications



Mast cell leukemia (MCL) - An
aggressive cancer described as a buildup
of mast cells found in more than 20%
of your body’s tissues or organs. This
subtype is very rare.



Mast cell sarcoma (MCS) - A tumor
made of abnormal mast cells has invaded
your body’s tissues. This condition is very
rare, and is often not associated with
additional skin issues.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Systemic Mastocytosis, 2022

Symptoms are associated with your type of
mastocytosis:


Cutaneous mastocytosis - The most
common symptom is macules on
the upper and lower extremities and
abdomen. A macule is a flat, discolored
(brown or tan) area of skin less than 1
centimeter (cm) wide.



Systemic mastocytosis - You may
experience symptoms found with
cutaneous mastocytosis, as well as brain
fog, low blood pressure (hypotension),
abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea,
fatigue, and frequent headaches. You
may also experience an enlarged liver
and spleen, anemia, or osteoporosis.

Speak to your health care provider about any
symptoms you are experiencing.

Basics

Complications

Complications

Causes

Mastocytosis is most often caused by
mutations (changes) in the KIT gene. The
KIT gene tells the body to make a protein that
helps to control cell growth, division, survival,
and movement. Mutations in this gene is
what causes an overproduction of mast cells.
Most cases of systemic mastocytosis are
not inherited. The cause of the mutation is
because of a random change in the KIT gene.
It is unknown why this mutation occurs.

A complication is an unwanted result of a
disease or treatment. Complications may
negatively affect your outcome of a disease.
Complications of systemic mastocytosis may
include:

It is important to tell
your care team about
all side effects so
they can be managed.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Systemic Mastocytosis, 2022



Anaphylactic (allergic) reaction - rapid
heartbeat, fainting, loss of consciousness
and shock. A severe reaction may require
a shot of epinephrine. An epinephrine
injection is used to treat life-threatening
allergic reactions.



Blood disorders - anemia, cytopenia, and
poor blood clotting



Bone fractures (caused by disease)



Peptic ulcer disease - ulcers and bleeding
in your digestive tract



Reduced bone density - you may be
at risk of bone problems, such as
osteoporosis



Organ failure - inflammation and damage
to the organs



Liver problems - the liver can become
swollen and may not work as well.



Cancer - although rare, you may develop
mast cell leukemia or mast cell sarcoma
(cancer of the body’s soft tissues)

Testing

Test results

Treatment planning starts with testing.
Accurate testing is needed to diagnose
and treat systemic mastocytosis. This
chapter presents an overview of the
tests you might receive and what to
expect.

Create a medical binder

Test results

A medical binder or notebook is a great
way to organize all of your records in one
place.

Mastocytosis will be diagnosed based on
a series of test results. Your diagnosis will
determine your treatment plan. It is important
you understand what these test results mean.

•

Make copies of blood tests, imaging
results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

•

Choose a binder that meets your
needs. Consider a zipper pocket to
include a pen, small calendar, and
insurance cards.

•

Create folders for insurance forms,
medical records, and tests results. You
can do the same on your computer.

•

Use online patient portals to view
your test results and other records.
Download or print the records to add to
your binder.

•

Organize your binder in a way that
works for you. Add a section for
questions and to take notes.

•

Bring your medical binder to
appointments. You never know when
you might need it!

Keep these things in mind:


Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.



Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.







Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about your specific disease.
Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.
Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician
informed of changes to this list.

General health tests

General health tests



Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin. Tell your
doctor if you have felt any lumps or have
any pain.



Conduct a complete skin exam

Medical history

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
You may also want to bring in pictures of
allergic reactions. Tell your doctor about any
symptoms you have. A medical history will help
determine which treatment is best for you. It is
sometimes called a health history.

For a list of possible tests, see Guide 1.

Testing takes time.
It might take days
or weeks for all test
results to come in.

Family history

Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your doctor will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history. Ask family members about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed.

Physical exam

During a physical exam, a health care provider
may:


Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat



Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched. Tell your doctor if you feel pain.

Blood tests

Blood tests

blood. Your doctor will want to know if you
have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells to fight
infection, and platelets to control bleeding.
There are several types of white blood cells.

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein.

A differential counts the number of each type
of white blood cell. It also checks if the counts
are in balance with each other.

Comprehensive metabolic panel

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is
a test that measures 14 different substances
in your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.


Serum tryptase level

Tryptase is an enzyme that is released with
histamine and other chemicals, from mast
cells when they are part of a normal immune
response as well as an allergic reaction. This
test measures the amount of tryptase in the
blood.

Uric acid - A uric acid blood test is a
medical test used to check the amount of
a normal waste product in your blood. It is
also known as a serum urate (SU) test or
as a uric acid level.



Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) - LDH is
a type of protein, known as an enzyme.
LDH is found in almost all the body’s
tissues, including in the blood, heart,
kidneys, brain, and lungs. When these
tissues are damaged, they release LDH
into the bloodstream or other body fluids.
If your LDH blood or fluid levels are high,
it may mean certain tissues in your body
have been damaged by disease or injury.



Liver function tests (LFTs) - LFTs look
at the health of your liver by measuring
chemicals that are made or processed by
the liver. Levels that are too high or low
signal that the liver is not working well or
the bile ducts might be blocked.

Blood smear

A blood smear is often used as further testing
if your CBC shows abnormal results. This test
is used to evaluate the different types of blood
cells. It may be used to help diagnose and/
or monitor conditions that affect blood cell
production.

Complete blood count with differential

will be pushed through your skin and into the
bone. Liquid bone marrow will then be drawn
into a syringe. For the biopsy, a needle will be
used to remove a core sample. The samples
will be sent to a lab for testing. You may feel
bone pain at your hip for a few days. Your skin
may bruise.

A biopsy is the removal of a sample of
tissue or group of cells for testing. It is an
important part of an accurate diagnosis.
Your sample should be reviewed by a
pathologist who is an expert in the diagnosis
of systemic mastocytosis. This review is often
referred to as histology, histopathology, or
hematopathology review. The pathologist will
note the overall appearance and the size,
shape, and type of your cells. Tests will be
done on the biopsied cells.

Ask your provider about the type of bone
marrow test you might have, where the
sample will be taken, and if you will be given
something to help relax.

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy

Bone marrow is like a sponge holding liquid.
A bone marrow aspiration takes some of the
liquid out of the sponge; a biopsy takes a piece
of the sponge. For aspiration, a hollow needle

Testing

Immunophenotyping

Immunophenotyping

Organ-directed biopsies

For mastocytosis you can expect to receive
one of the following organ-directed biopsies.

Immunophenotyping uses antibodies to detect
the presence or absence of white blood cell
antigens. These antigens are proteins that
can be found on the surface of or inside white
blood cells. They are called biomarkers.

EGD or upper endoscopy
A gastrointestinal (GI) biopsy
is often performed to confirm a
diagnosis of mastocytosis. In an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), a
device is guided down the throat into the
esophagus, stomach, and upper parts of the
small intestine (duodenum). An EGD is used to
inspect the lining of these organs and to look
for any signs of cancer or other abnormalities
such as dilated blood vessels or ulcers. After
the procedure, your throat may feel sore and
you may feel some swelling.

A complete blood test can count the number
of white blood cells, but it cannot detect the
subtle differences between different types of
blood cancers. Immunophenotyping can detect
these subtle differences.
There are 2 testing methods:

Liver biopsy
In a liver biopsy, a needle may be inserted
through the skin to remove a liver sample. It
also may be inserted through a large vein in
your neck (jugular), and threaded down to a
vein (inferior vena cava) near your liver.

Flow cytometry

Immunohistochemistry

Flow cytometry

Flow cytometry is a laboratory method used to
detect, identify, and count specific cells. Flow
cytometry involves adding a light-sensitive dye

to cells. The dyed cells are passed through
a beam of light in a machine. The machine

shape of the cells, and other unique features
of cells. Flow cytometry may be used on cells
from circulating (peripheral) blood or from a
bone marrow aspirate.

acid) molecule with genetic material of
an organism. The test specifically looks
for broken, missing, rearranged, or extra
chromosomes.

Myeloid mutation panel

A myeloid mutation panel is a blood test used
to identify mutated genes. This test helps to
diagnose and manage diseases such as acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasm
(MPN), and MDS/MPN.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to cells. The cells are then
studied using a microscope.

Biomarker tests

Genetic tests

Biomarker tests also referred to as molecular
tests are used to look for changes in one or
more genes, and to determine if any abnormal
genes or proteins are present.

Your doctor may suggest tests for gene
mutations. Genes tell cells what to become
and what to do. In a process called mutation,
something goes wrong in the genetic code.
This can cause cells to grow and divide out of
control.

FISH test

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. FISH
can look for translocations (switching parts
between 2 chromosomes) and inversions
(switching parts within one chromosome) that
are too small to be seen with other methods.
However, it can only be used for known
changes. It cannot detect all the possible
changes found within your chromosomes
(karyotype).

Genetic testing looks for the presence or
absence of certain gene mutations. Test results
will help your treatment team learn more about
your disease and make a treatment plan.
Since this test doesn’t need growing cells, it
can be peformed on either a bone marrow
or blood sample. A bone marrow sample is
needed to get all the information your doctor
needs to help plan your care.

Cytogenetics

Cytogenetics is a type of genetic test that uses
samples of tissue, blood, or bone marrow
to look for changes in chromosomes. A
chromosome is a long DNA (deoxyribonucleic

permanent and will leave the body in your
urine immediately after the test.

A mutation in the KIT gene is the most
common genetic change found in systemic
mastocytosis. The KIT gene provides
instructions for making a protein. It is important
for the development and role of certain cell
types. This includes reproductive cells (germ
cells), early blood cells (hematopoietic stem
cells), white blood cells (mast cells), cells
in the gastrointestinal tract called interstitial
cells of Cajal, and cells called melanocytes.
KIT D816V is the gene specific to systemic
mastocytosis.

Tell your doctors if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines,
such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and
prednisone (steroids), to avoid the effects of
those allergies. Contrast might not be used if
you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys
are not working well.

MRI scan

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Contrast might be used.

Imaging
Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body. A radiologist, an expert in
interpreting test images, will write a report
and send this report to your doctor. Your test
results will be discussed with you.

Ultrasound

An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. A probe will be pressed onto your
abdomen. This is similar to the sonogram used
for pregnancy. Ultrasound is painless and
does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as
needed. It can show small areas of cancer that
are near the surface of the body. Sometimes,
an ultrasound or CT is used to guide a biopsy.

CT scan

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture.

DEXA scan

A DEXA scan is an imaging test that measures
bone strength (density). DEXA scans are used
to determine your risk for osteoporosis (bone
loss).

In most cases, contrast will be used. Contrast
material is used to improve the pictures of
the inside of the body. Contrast materials are
not dyes, but substances that help enhance
and improve the images of several organs
and structures in the body. It is used to
make the pictures clearer. Contrast might
be taken by mouth (oral) or given through a
vein (intravenous [IV]). The contrast is not

A skeletal survey, also referred to as a bone
survey, is a series of x-rays taken to look at
all the bones in your body. This test is used to
determine if bone disease is present.

Testing

Other tests

Other tests
You may receive additional tests such as
urine testing, HLA typing, or a quality of life
(QOL) assessment. These tests will help to
determine the extent of your disease and
treatment for symptoms.

Urine test

Instead of a blood test, urine tests are often
used to help determine the presence of
histamine in your body. The test consists
of providing urine over a 24-hour period to
evaluate histamine production over a longer
time frame.

HLA typing

Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are
proteins found on the surface of most cells.
They play an important role in your body’s
immune response. HLAs are unique to each
person. They mark your body’s cells. Your
body detects these markers to tell which cells
are yours. Each person’s set of HLAs is called
the HLA type or tissue type.
HLA typing is a blood test that detects a
person’s HLA type. This test is done before a
donor (allogeneic) blood stem cell transplant.
To find a donor match, your proteins will be
compared to the donor’s proteins to see how
many proteins are the same.

Quality of life assessment

You may be asked to complete a quality of life
(QOL) assessment called an MC-QoL. It is a
disease-specific tool that looks to identify your
physical and mental wellness, as well your
ability to function in your daily activities.

Hereditary alphatryptasemia
Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (HαT) refers
to a biochemical trait. A trait is a change in
your DNA. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic
acid. It is in every cell of every living thing.
Those with HαT have inherited extra copies
of the alpha tryptase gene (TPSAB1). Extra
copies of this gene cause increased levels
of the trypase protein in blood tests. Trypase
is a protein made by mast cells. Trypase is
often used to test for a mast cell activation.
A mast cell activation results in an allergic
reaction.
Symptoms of HαT may include:
•

Itchy skin, flushing, hives, and
anaphylaxis

•

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as
bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and/
or constipation, heartburn, and difficulty
swallowing

•

Connective tissue symptoms such as
hypermobile joints and scoliosis

•

Cardiac symptoms such as a racing or
pounding heartbeat or blood pressure
swings with/without fainting

•

Anxiety, depression, and panic attacks

Testing

Key points

Key points


Mastocytosis will be diagnosed based on
a series of test results. Your diagnosis
will determine your treatment plan. It is
important you understand what these
tests mean.



Blood tests check for signs of disease
and how well organs are working. They
require a sample of your blood, which is
removed through a needle placed into
your vein.



A biopsy is the removal of a sample of
tissue or group of cells for testing. It is an
important part of an accurate diagnosis.



Immunophenotyping uses antibodies to
detect the presence or absence of white
blood cell antigens. These antigens are
proteins that can be found on the surface
of or inside white blood cells. They are
called biomarkers.



Genetic testing looks for the presence or
absence of certain gene mutations. Test
results will help your treatment team learn
more about your disease and make a
treatment plan.



Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body.



You may receive additional tests such as
urine testing, HLA typing, or a quality of
life assessment. These tests will help to
determine the extent of your disease and
treatment for symptoms.

Treatment

Treatment team

This chapter presents an overview
of the different treatment types for
systemic mastocytosis. Together, you
and your doctor will choose a treatment
plan that is best for you.

Treatment team

Your treatment team

Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of doctors, health care workers, and
social care professionals from different
professional backgrounds who have
knowledge (expertise) and experience with
systemic mastocytosis. This team is united
in the planning and implementation of your
treatment.

Treating systemic mastocytosis takes a
team of doctors and other experts. Your
treatment team may include:
Dermatologist: specializes in the
diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases.
Hematologist: an expert in blood
diseases and cancers.

Ask who will coordinate your care.

Pathologist: an expert in evaluating and
testing tissue to diagnose and classify
disease

You know your body better than anyone. Help
other team members understand:


How you feel



What you need



What is working and what is not

Gastroenterologist: specializes in
diagnosing and treating diseases that
occur in the gastrointestinal system.
Allergist: specializes in the diagnosis
and treatment of asthma and other
allergic diseases.

Keep a list of names and contact information
for each member of your team. This will make
it easier for you and anyone involved in your
care to know whom to contact with questions
or concerns.

Treatment

Antihistamines

Antihistamines

Guide 2
Antihistamine treatment options:
Systemic mastocytosis

Antihistamines, also referred to as allergy
medicine, block histamines to stop allergy
symptoms. A histamine is a chemical made by
the body that is released by blood basophils
(white blood cells) into the bloodstream when
your immune system is defending against a
potential allergen. Antihistamines can control
itchy skin, watery eyes, as well as other
allergic symptoms of mastocytosis.

Brompheniramine maleate
Cetirizine hydrochloride (Zyrtec®)
Chlorpheniramine maleate (Chlor-Trimeton®)
Cimetidine (Tagamet®)

Epinephrine

Desloratadine (Clarinex®)

Epinephrine is an drug used in emergencies to
treat an allergic reaction. Epinephrine helps to
quickly improve breathing, stimulate the heart,
raise a dropping blood pressure, reverse hives,
and reduce swelling of the face, lips, and
throat. The drug is injected through your skin,
often in the thigh.

Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine®)
Diphenhydramine hydrochloride
Doxylamine (Unisom®)
Epinephrine (EpiPen®)

A list of antihistamines most often used for the
treatment of systemic mastocytosis can be
found in Guide 2.

Famotidine (Pepcid®)
Fexofenadine hydrochloride (Allegra®)

Treatment

Targeted therapy | Immunosuppressants

Targeted therapy

Immunosuppressants

Targeted therapy is a form of systemic therapy
that works throughout your body. It is a drug
therapy that focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop the action
of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/
or survive.

Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) uses
materials made either by the body or in a
laboratory to improve, target, or restore
immune system function. IST is a type of
drug therapy that lowers the body’s immune
response to allow bone marrow stem
cells to grow and make new blood cells.
Immunosuppressants can be topical or
systemic.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor

ISTs used to treat systemic mastocytosis
include:

A tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a type of
targeted therapy that blocks the signals that
cause cancer to grow and spread. TKIs might
be used alone or in combination with other
systemic therapies like chemotherapy.
TKIs used to treat systemic mastocytosis
include:


PDGFR - directed TKI - Avapritinib
(Ayvakit™)



BCR-ABL - directed TKI - Imatinib
mesylate (Gleevec®)



FLT3 - directed TKI - Midostaurin
(Rydapt®)

Biologic response modifier



Prednisone



Steroids

Biologic response modifiers

Biologic response modifiers (BRM), is a type
of treatment that activates the body’s immune
system to fight cancer. BRM is used to help
the immune system do its job. BRM is also
referred to as immunotherapy. Peginterferon
alfa-2a (Pegasys®), is a specific BRM used to
treat systemic mastocytosis.

Prednisone

Prednisone is used to decrease the number of
mast cells and block the release of histamine
in systemic mastocytosis.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
normal cells. Chemotherapy drugs used for
the treatment of systemic mastocytosis affect
the instructions (genes) that tell cells how and
when to grow and divide.
Cladribine (Leustatin®) is a chemotherapy drug
used to treat systemic mastocytosis.

Treatment

Immunosuppressants

Steroids

Corticosteroids or steroids are lab-made
immunosuppressants used to reduce
inflammation. Steroids can be placed on the
skin as an ointment or gel, inhaled through
the mouth, used as a mouth (oral) rinse, taken
as a pill, or given as an infusion through an
intravenous (IV) needle.

Get to know your
care team and let
them get to
know you.

Steroids can cause short-term and longterm side effects. Ask your care team about
possible side effects.
Steroids used to treat systemic mastocytosis:


Beclomethasone dipropionate
(Diprolene®)



Dexamethasone/dexamethasone sodium
phosphate



Hydrocortisone (Cortef®)



Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol®)

Steroids
In systemic mastocytosis,
steroids are used to help
reduce allergies and
inflammation. The most
common types of steroids
are tablets, liquid, or
intravenous (injection into
a vein).

Treatment

Clinical trials

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
diseases need to be studied in people. If
found to be safe and effective in a clinical
trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach
may be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Finding a clinical trial

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.


Phase I trials study the dose, safety, and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.



Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.



Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved

Treatment

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may include age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Start the conversation

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Frequently asked questions

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Treatment

Allogeneic HCT

Allogeneic HCT

After conditioning, you will receive the healthy
stem cells through a transfusion. A transfusion
is a slow injection of blood products into
a vein. This can take several hours. New,
healthy blood cells will form. This is called
engraftment. It usually occurs about 2 to 4
weeks after the transplant.

Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) (also
referred to as bone marrow transplant [BMT]
or stem cell transplant [SCT]) destroys cells in
the bone marrow and replaces them with new,
healthy blood cells. An allogeneic transplant
uses healthy stem cells from a donor. The
donor may or may not be related to you.

Until the new, healthy blood cells form, you
will have little or no immune defense. You
may need to stay in a very clean room at the
hospital or be given antibiotics to prevent or
treat infection. While waiting for the cells to
engraft, you will likely feel tired and weak.

Before an SCT, you will receive a procedure
called conditioning. Conditioning uses
chemotherapy (and/or radiation therapy) to
destroy bone marrow cells. This procedure
creates room for the healthy stem cells and
weakens the immune system so your body
does not kill the transplanted cells.

Allogeneic SCT

steps of a stem cell
transplant.

Treatment

Observation | General supportive care
Distress

Allogeneic HCT may help cure mast cell
diseases, however it is rarely used because of
risks and other effective treatment options.

Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt.

Observation

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping problems
are common in cancer. Talk to your doctor and
with those whom you feel most comfortable
about how you are feeling. There are services
and people who can help you. Support and
counseling services are available.

Observation is a plan that closely watches your
condition. Observation may also be referred to
as surveillance or watch-and-wait. During this
time, you will have tests on a regular basis to
look for any new or changing symptoms. You
will not have any treatment during observation.

For more information, see NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Distress During Cancer Care,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines.

General supportive care

Fatigue

Supportive care is health care that relieves
symptoms and improves quality of life. It might
include pain relief (palliative care), emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you
are feeling and about any side effects. Best
supportive care, supportive care, and palliative
care are often used interchangeably.

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability
to function due to lack of energy. There are
treatments for fatigue. Let your care team
know how you are feeling and if fatigue is
getting in the way of doing the things you
enjoy. Eating a balanced diet, exercise, yoga,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian (an expert
in nutrition and food) to help with fatigue.

Diarrhea

Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how
to manage diarrhea and may recommend
medicines to stop the diarrhea. It is important
to drink lots of fluids. Changes to your diet
might help.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Systemic Mastocytosis, 2022

Fertility

Fertility is the ability to have children. In order
to preserve one’s fertility, action may be
needed before starting treatment. However,
this is not always possible. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options.

Treatment

General supportive care

Nausea and vomiting

Nausea and vomiting might be a sign of
systemic mastocytosis. You will be given
medicine to treat nausea and vomiting.

Keep a pain diary
A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain,
how bad it is, what causes it, and what
makes it better or worse. Use a pain diary
to discuss your pain with your care team.
You might be referred to a specialist for
pain management.

Trouble eating

Sometimes side effects from systemic
mastocytosis might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating
is important during treatment. It includes
eating a balanced diet, eating the right
amount of food, and drinking enough fluids.
A registered dietitian can help. Speak to
your care team if you have trouble eating or
maintaining your weight.

Include in your pain diary:

Pain

Pain is common in systemic mastocytosis. It
might be caused by nausea and vomiting or
abdominal cramps from diarrhea. Tell your
care team about any pain or discomfort. You
might meet with a palliative care specialist or
with a pain specialist to manage pain.

Systemic mastocytosis

Diagnosis

Systemic mastocytosis is a rare disease
that is caused by too many mast cells
in your body. When mast cells are
triggered they release substances
similar to an allergic reaction. This
chapter reviews the different types of
systemic mastocytosis as well as testing
and treatment options.

a skin biopsy. During a skin biopsy, a sample
of skin tissue is taken and looked at under a
microscope to look for a buildup of mast cells.
If there are no cutaneous lesions or if the
skin biopsy reveals uncertain results, a bone
marrow biopsy may be performed.
Skin is not the only organ affected by systemic
mastocytosis. You may receive blood and/or
urine tests to measure the levels of specific
chemicals or substances related to mast cells.
If tests show high levels of these substances,
you will be diagnosed with systemic
mastocytosis. Other tests you may receive
include a bone scan, gastrointestinal workup,
or genetic testing to confirm there is a mutation
in the KIT gene.

Diagnosis
Systemic mastocytosis is a rare disorder
defined by an abnormal buildup of mast cells
in the skin, bone marrow, and internal organs
(such as the liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract,
and lymph nodes).

If the systemic mastocytosis is aggressive
(forms, grows, or spreads quickly), it can
be life-threatening. Systemic mastocytosis
includes two rare forms, mast cell leukemia
and mast cell sarcoma.

Systemic mastocytosis is often diagnosed
due to signs or symptoms. For example, a
symptom of skin lesions may be confirmed by

Mast Cell
When triggered, mast cells
release granules filled with
chemicals (such as histamine),
which sets off an allergic
reaction.

Systemic mastocytosis

ISM and SSM

ISM and SSM

Smoldering systemic mastocytosis

Smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM) is
a form of systemic mastocytosis that is slow
to progress into a more advanced disease. It
refers to a gradual buildup of mast cells in your
internal organs. Symptoms of SSM typically
include an enlarged spleen, an increase in
bone marrow (as seen in anemia or certain
cancers), and skin lesions such as urticaria
pigmentosa. People can remain stable for
years or may develop a more aggressive type
of systemic mastocytosis.

Indolent systemic mastocytosis

Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) is
a benign (not harmful) form of systemic
mastocytosis. It refers to an abnormal buildup
of mast cells. Mast cells often build up in the
bone marrow, as well as other organs or skin.
ISM has a low mast cell buildup compared to
other types of systemic mastocytosis. Some
people may experience maculopapular (flat
and raised) skin lesions, an enlarged liver
or spleen, or pain and discomfort within the
gastrointestinal tract. ISM has a low risk of
moving into a more aggressive disease.

Treatment options
Primary treatment options for indolent or



Quality of life assessment

If you respond to primary treatment, you may
be asked to continue it and/or consider a test
for an allogeneic HCT.
If you have little or no response to primary
treatment, you will be restaged and treated
based on your new stage of disease.

If testing shows your disease has progressed,
you will be restaged and treated based on the
new stage.

Systemic mastocytosis with AHN

Systemic mastocytosis with an associated
hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) refers to
a large number of mast cells that build up
in certain tissues and organs, damaging
them. Affected tissues or organs may include
the bone marrow, lymph nodes, bone,
liver, spleen, and small intestine. Systemic
mastocytosis with associated hematologic
neoplasm refers to a mast cell buildup that
occurs together with another blood disorder,
usually a myelodysplastic syndrome,
myeloproliferative disorder, or acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). Myeloproliferative and
myelodysplastic disorders are the most
common diseases associated with SM-AHN.

Advanced
Aggressive systemic mastocytosis

Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) is
described as a loss of organ function (usually
liver, gut, bone, or bone marrow) due to mast
cells getting in and taking over. Examples of
organ function loss include low numbers of
white bloods cells, anemia, low platelets, liver
dysfunction, and bone fractures due to bone
lesions.

Mast cell leukemia (MCL) is a very
rare and aggressive type of systemic
mastocytosis. MCL does not have
positive outcomes.

Myeloid progenitor cells (stem cells) can
become mast cells, platelets, red blood cells,
and white blood cells.
There is no clear reason why MCL develops,
but several gene mutations in the KIT gene
have been linked to it.

condition that leads to the buildup of mast cells
in your bone marrow and other tissues.

Leukemia is a group of cancers that’s caused
by cells in your bone marrow that produce
abnormal or underdeveloped blood cells.
Leukemias are classified based on the type
of cells that are affected. Mast cell leukemia
(MCL), is a type of leukemia that is caused
by an abnormal growth of cells from myeloid
progenitor cells.

Symptoms of MCL may include:


Low blood pressure



Fatigue



Gastrointestinal distress

Mast cell leukemia
MCL originates in the bone marrow (myeloid tissue). It involves an overgrowth of mast cells.
This crowds out production of red blood cells and platelets as pictured.

Cladribine (Leustatin®)

Advance care planning
Advance care planning refers to making
decisions now about the care you would
want to receive if you become unable to
speak for yourself.
Advance care planning is for everyone, not
just for those who are very sick. It is a way
to ensure your wishes are understood and
respected. Your plan can be changed at any
time.

If you respond to primary treatment, you may
be asked to continue it and/or consider a test
for an allogeneic HCT.
If your disease gets worse (progesses to AHN
[associated hematologic neoplasm] or AML
[acute myeloid leukemia]), you may be given
AHN-directed therapy. AHN-directed therapy is
based on your specific blood disorder. It may
include a multiagent chemotherapy and/or
consideration of an allogeneic HCT.

Advance care planning starts with an honest
conversation with your doctor. Ask your
doctor about the course your cancer will
take, called a prognosis. Find out what you
might expect if your cancer spreads. Discuss
the medicines or therapies that will give you
the best quality of life.

If you have no response to treatment, you will
undergo more testing to restage your disease.

Include family and friends in your advance
care planning. Make your wishes clear. It is
important that everyone understands what
you want.

No response to treatment refers to any of the
following:


Return or progression of organ damage



Enlarged spleen or liver



Progression of systemic mastocytosis
symptoms



Resistance to drug therapy

MCL is very serious and life-threatening.
Treatment will focus on supportive care. This
includes symptom relief, quality of life, and
longer survival. It is important to ask your
health care provider about your prognosis.



Mast cell leukemia (MCL) is a very
rare and aggressive type of systemic
mastocytosis.



Mast cell leukemia (MCL) is a type of
leukemia that is caused by abnormal
growth of cells from myeloid progenitor
cells.



There is no clear reason why MCL
develops, but several gene mutations in
the KIT gene have been linked to it.



Symptoms of MCL include low blood
pressure, rashes, and itchy skin.



MCL is very serious and life-threatening.
Treatment will focus on supportive care.

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your doctor.

your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

Second opinion

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.
Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Questions to ask your doctors
Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
