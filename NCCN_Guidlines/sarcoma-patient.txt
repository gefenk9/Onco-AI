About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Soft Tissue Sarcoma, Version 1.2024 — April 26, 2024.

Soft tissue sarcoma basics

Soft tissue sarcoma describes

tissue sarcomas form most often in the limbs
(the arms and legs), followed by the torso.
The torso (also called trunk) is the area of the
body between the groin and the collarbone, not
including the arms. The chest, abdomen, back,
and pelvis are all located in the torso.

a group of over 50 cancers that
form in soft tissue. Soft tissue is
found everywhere in the body, and
includes muscle, fat, and nerves.

Soft tissue sarcomas can also form in the
head, the neck, and the space in front of the
lower spine and behind the abdominal cavity.
This space is called the retroperitoneum.
Organs in the retroperitoneum include the
adrenal glands, aorta, kidneys, esophagus,
ureters, pancreas, rectum, and parts of the
stomach and colon.

Soft tissue sarcoma is best treated
by a team of experts in different
types of cancer care. This team
should have experience treating
your specific type of sarcoma.

The other, less common type of sarcoma is
bone sarcoma, such as osteosarcoma. Soft
tissue sarcoma is the focus of this book.

Soft tissue sarcoma starts in cells that develop
into soft tissue, called mesenchymal cells. Soft

Soft tissue sarcoma basics » Types of soft tissue sarcoma

Types of soft tissue
sarcoma

Liposarcomas are fat-forming
tumors. These are most common in the
retroperitoneum and legs.

The cells of each type of sarcoma look
different under a microscope. Physicians with
specialty training in pathology (pathologists)
examine tissue using a microscope to
determine the type of soft tissue sarcoma. An
accurate tumor type (also called histology or
histopathology) is needed to create the best
treatment plan for you.

Leiomyosarcomas are tumors made of
smooth muscle. These are most often found in
the abdomen.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)
form in the digestive tract. GIST is addressed
separately in the NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(GIST) available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

There are over 50 types of soft tissue tumors,
which behave very differently. Some may
return to the same area but not spread further,
while others often spread to other parts of the
body. This is one reason why it is important to
have an accurate tumor type.
Most soft tissue tumors fall into one of the
following categories:


Adipocytic tumors



Fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumors



Fibrohistiocytic tumors



Peripheral nerve sheath tumors



Smooth muscle tumors

Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
(UPS) is the most common type of soft tissue
sarcoma. In UPS, the cells don’t look like
the soft tissue in which they are found. This
is one example of a tumor in the “uncertain
differentiation” category. These are most
common in the legs and arms.

Risk factors

The importance of
specialized care

A small number of people carry a mutation
(change) in their genes that increases the risk
of developing soft tissue sarcoma. Those with
such mutations are said to have hereditary or
genetic syndromes. For soft tissue sarcomas,
these include:

Soft tissue sarcomas are rare. Some are so
rare that there aren’t specific recommendations
for how to treat them. Most doctors are not
experts in diagnosing or treating these tumors.
It is important to find a treatment center or
hospital that has experts with experience in
your type of soft tissue sarcoma. Ideally you
would receive all your care with those experts.
For those who live far from such centers, it
often is possible for the experts to provide
you with a treatment plan and coordinate with
your local doctors. This would allow you to
receive care closer to home. Certain types of
treatments, such as clinical trials or specialized
radiation therapy, may only be available at
specialized treatment centers or hospitals.

often have the same mutation. It is important
that you share what you know about your
family history with your doctor. This helps them
determine if you may benefit from genetic
testing. If so, a genetic counselor may speak
to you about the results. A genetic counselor is
an expert who has special training in genetic
diseases. More information on genetic testing
is provided in the next chapter.

sarcoma starts with imaging
scans and a biopsy. Other testing

The choice of CT versus MRI depends on the
type and location of the tumor. For example,
MRI is preferred for tumors in the brain, spine,
and extremities. Both CT and MRI can provide
details about the size of the tumor, and how
close it is to nearby organs, nerves, and blood
vessels.

is individualized based on the
location of the tumor and your
health history.

A radiologist is an expert at interpreting
medical scans. A radiologist will review the
images and write a report. The radiologist will
send this report to your doctor who will discuss
the results with you. Depending on what they
see, the radiologist may suggest that you have
another or different type of imaging scan.

Imaging
Imaging tests make pictures of areas inside
of the body. They can show the primary (first)
tumor and other possible areas of cancer. The
imaging tests used most often for soft tissue
sarcoma are computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

PET

CT takes many x-rays of the same body
part from different angles. Using computer
technology, the images are combined to make
detailed pictures.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scans
use a radioactive substance called a tracer
or isotope. This substance identifies tissues
that are using a lot of energy. Most cancers,
including sarcomas, use much more energy

CT scan
A CT scan is a more
detailed type of x-ray. It is
painless and noninvasive.
CT takes many images
from different angles.
A computer combines
the images to make 3D
pictures.

than normal cells and show up as brights spots
on PET scans. Not all bright spots are cancer.
PET is usually combined with CT scans and can
provide additional helpful information.

A pathologist is an expert in examining tissue
and cells to diagnose disease. After examining
the tissues and cells with a microscope, the
pathologist writes a summary of the results.
This is called a pathology report.

Contrast
Before CT or MRI, you may be given a contrast
agent. Contrast is a liquid put into your body
that changes how certain types of tissue appear
when imaged. Often, your doctors will order
the same type of scan (CT or MRI) with and
without contrast to get better information about
the tumor. Tell your care team if you have had a
reaction to contrast in the past. If you have, you
might be given medicine, such as Benadryl or
prednisone. Contrast might not be used if you
have a serious allergy or if your kidneys don’t
work well.

The pathologist often performs other tests to
see if the tumor cells have specific genes or
proteins. This is often necessary to diagnose
the tumor type. This may also help choose
the best treatment plan for your tumor type.
Because not all pathologists are familiar with
every type of soft tissue sarcoma, review at
an experienced center is recommended. Ask
questions about your biopsy results and what it
means for your treatment.
Sometimes the pathologist is not able to
make a diagnosis from your biopsy. This may
be because the tissue is dead, because the
biopsy does not have enough cells for all of the
tests needed, or because no cancer is seen.

Biopsy
After imaging tests, your doctor will usually
order or perform a biopsy. This involves
removing a sample of the tumor for testing. The
preferred type of biopsy for soft tissue sarcoma
is a core needle biopsy. It removes tissue
with a wide, hollow needle.
Another type called an incisional or open
biopsy removes a small amount of tissue
through a cut in the skin or body. Sometimes,
doctors may perform a biopsy using a thinner
needle, called fine needle aspiration (FNA).
Most soft tissue sarcomas are deep within the
body. For these tumors, biopsies are guided
using imaging, such as an ultrasound or CT.
Image-guided needle biopsies are usually
needed for tumors in the chest, abdomen,
pelvis, and retroperitoneum. If your doctor
believes your tumor is close to the skin, they
may do a biopsy without imaging guidance.

Testing » Genetic tests

Genetic tests

should be considered for further genetic
testing.

Certain genetic syndromes increase the risk of
developing a soft tissue sarcoma. Mutations
(changes) in different genes cause each of
these genetic syndromes. Testing for gene
mutations that cause these syndromes may
be helpful for treating soft tissue sarcoma, and
for monitoring your or your family members for
cancers.

FAP
People with familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP) have an adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) gene mutation. This syndrome causes
many polyps to form in the colon and rectum.
The polyps start as noncancerous growths, but
over time they can turn into cancer.

Share what you know about your family
history with your care team. If your health
care provider thinks you may have a genetic
syndrome that is causing your cancer, they
might refer you for genetic testing. If needed,
testing should be carried out by a pathologist
who is experienced in genetic testing
techniques. A genetic counselor may speak to
you about the results. A genetic counselor is
an expert who has special training in genetic
diseases.

FAP has a related syndrome called Gardner
syndrome. In addition to bowel polyps, those
with Gardner syndrome have abnormal bony
growths and skin and soft tissue tumors.
Your care team will gather information to
determine if you are likely to have Gardner
syndrome or FAP. Both are associated with
desmoid tumors. If you are diagnosed with a
desmoid tumor, your family history should be
looked at closely. Your doctor may suggest a
colonoscopy.

Hereditary retinoblastoma

Neurofibromatosis

Retinoblastoma is cancer that forms in the
retina (the light-sensitive layers of nerve tissue
at the back of the eye). It is most common
in children under the age of 5. It may be
hereditary or nonhereditary. The hereditary
form increases the risk of leiomyosarcoma and
osteosarcoma.

This rare genetic condition causes tumors to
grow on nerves. These tumors are usually
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors
(MPNSTs). About 5 out of 100 people with
neurofibromatosis will develop soft tissue
sarcoma.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome

Lynch syndrome

Families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have
a mutation in the TP53 gene. This gene
helps control repair or survival of damaged
cells. Families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
have a history of sarcoma, breast cancer,
adrenocortical tumors, and some brain tumors.
Those who have a personal and/or family
history that suggests Li-Fraumeni syndrome

Soft Tissue Sarcoma, 2024

Lynch syndrome is also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Those
born with Lynch syndrome are at high risk of
developing colorectal cancer and some other
cancers, particularly endometrial and ovarian
cancer. While not common, Lynch syndrome
can also increase the risk of soft tissue
sarcoma.

removed. It also means there is a decreased
chance that any cancer cells were left behind.

therapy, and other commonly used
treatments.

If all of the visible tumor is removed but the
pathologist finds microscopic cancer cells at
the margin, it is called an R1 positive margin.
If the surgeon is unable to remove all of the
visible tumor, it is called an R2 positive margin.

Treatment can be local, can work throughout
the body ("systemic"), or can be a combination
of both. Local therapy treats the tumor directly.
Surgery and radiation therapy are local
therapies. Chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy are systemic therapies.

Sometimes it is not possible to safely remove
the sarcoma with a cancer-free margin. If this
is expected, your surgeon may place clips in
your body after removing the tumor. The clips
will mark where to give radiation therapy. You
might have more than one surgery. You might
also have a wound drain to prevent fluid from
collecting in the body after surgery.

Surgery
Surgery, also called resection, is an operation
to remove cancer from the body. It is the
primary (main) treatment for sarcoma. Imaging
tests are used to determine if your cancer is
resectable (can be removed with surgery) or
unresectable (cannot be safely removed with
surgery). Unresectable tumors often involve
other critical body structures. Or they are so
extensive that surgery cannot remove the
whole tumor.

Limb-sparing
When surgery involves a limb (an arm or a
leg), the goal is to have a functional or working
limb after the tumor is removed. This is called
limb-sparing surgery. Most surgeries to remove
sarcomas in a limb use limb-sparing surgery.

The method and extent of surgery for sarcoma
depend on the tumor location and size, and
whether it involves nearby body parts. The
goal of surgery is to remove all the cancer. To
do so, the tumor is removed along with a rim
of normal-looking tissue around its edge. The
edges of the tissue that is resected are called
the surgical margins.

Rehabilitation will likely be part of a limbsparing treatment plan. Occupational therapy
helps with daily life skills. Physical therapy
helps your body move and function.
After surgery to remove a sarcoma, some
people may suffer from lymphedema,
or swelling in the limb. This can worsen
if radiation is also a part of treatment.
Lymphedema therapists can provide

this swelling.

removed by surgery. Location, the amount of
tissue that must be removed, and your overall
health are factors in determining if you are
eligible for metastasectomy.

Amputation
Amputation is the removal of a limb or other
body part. A surgeon who is an expert in
soft tissue sarcoma should be consulted to
determine if amputation is necessary or if limb
salvage is possible.

A metastasectomy may be done at the same
time as surgery to remove the primary tumor.
Or it may be done during a separate operation.
The amount of time needed for the surgery
and recovery depends on many factors.
Some factors include the size, location of the
metastases, and the type of surgery needed.

Rehabilitation, such as physical and
occupational therapy, will be part of this
treatment. Seek a peer support group to
connect with others who have experienced the
loss of a limb. This will aid in your recovery
and help you to maintain an active lifestyle.

Palliative surgery
Surgery may also be used to relieve symptoms
caused by the cancer or to extend life. This is
called palliative surgery.

Metastasectomy
A metastasectomy is surgery to remove one
or more distant (metastatic) tumors. It may
be an option when the primary tumor can be
completely removed and there are only a few
small metastatic tumors that can be safely

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses highenergy radiation from x-rays,
gamma rays, protons, and
other sources to kill cancer
cells and shrink tumors. It is
also used to treat pain.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Soft Tissue Sarcoma, 2024

Treatments » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy



Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation
from x-rays, gamma rays, protons, and other
sources to kill cancer cells. It is given alone or
with chemotherapy over a fixed period of time.
Radiation may be used to shrink the tumor
before surgery. This can make it easier to
resect (remove) the tumor, but may increase
wound healing problems.



Radiation is sometimes given to kill leftover
cancer cells after surgery. This may be
recommended if not all cancer was removed
during surgery, or if there is a high risk of
recurrence. When given after surgery, radiation
can lower the risk of the tumor growing back.
It may lead to increased scarring or stiffness
(fibrosis), which can reduce movement in the
affected limb.





Radiation can also be used during surgery,
called intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT),
or to ease pain or discomfort caused by
the tumor. This is called palliative radiation
therapy.

Proton beam radiation therapy
(PBRT) uses streams of particles called
protons to kill tumor cells and may reduce
the amount of radiation damage to nearby
healthy tissue.
Intraoperative radiation therapy
(IORT) uses radiation treatment aimed
directly at the tumor during surgery.

In brachytherapy, a radiation source is placed
inside or next to the tumor. This is also called
internal radiation therapy. Brachytherapy may
be used alone or with EBRT. When used with
EBRT it is called a brachytherapy boost.
LDR brachytherapy
Low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy uses thin,
hollow needles to place radioactive seeds into
the tumor. The seeds are about the size of a
grain of rice. They are guided into the tumor
with imaging tests.

EBRT
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor. Types of EBRT used to treat soft
tissue sarcoma include:

The seeds usually contain radioactive iodine or
palladium. They will stay in the tumor and give
a low dose of radiation for a few months. The
radiation will travel a very short distance. This
will allow for a large amount of radiation within
a small area while sparing nearby healthy

Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) is an advanced
radiation technique that uses many small
beams of different strengths.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Soft Tissue Sarcoma, 2024

Stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) uses high-energy
radiation beams to treat metastatic tumors
in five or fewer sessions.

Brachytherapy

The 2 main types of radiation treatment are
explained next. The method used depends on
the size and type of sarcoma, and the goal of
treatment.



Image-guided radiation therapy
(IGRT) helps guide the radiation beam
during treatment. Tumors can shift slightly
within the body and can change shape
and size between and during treatment
visits. IGRT can improve how well IMRT
targets the tumor.

Treatment team
Treating soft tissue sarcoma takes a team
approach. Treatment planning should involve
a team of doctors from different fields of
medicine who have experience in your type
of soft tissue sarcoma. Some members of
your care team will be with you throughout
treatment, while others will only be there for
parts of it. Get to know your care team and let
them get to know you.
•

A pathologist diagnoses a tumor
by studying cells and tissues under a
microscope.

•

A diagnostic radiologist reads the
results of x-rays and other imaging tests
such as an MRI or CT scan.

Depending on your diagnosis, your team
might include:

• An orthopedic surgical oncologist
performs operations to remove soft
tissue and bone sarcomas that involve
the pelvis, spine, and extremities. They
perform limb salvage surgery and
reconstruct bones after a bone tumor is
removed.

•

Oncology nurses provide handson care, like giving systemic therapy,
answering questions, and helping with
side effects.

•

Advanced practice providers
are nurse practitioners and physician
assistants who work with physicians to
provide care.

•

An interventional radiologist
performs needle biopsies of tumors and
sometimes ablative therapies.

•

A thoracic surgeon removes tumors
from within the chest or lungs.

•

A plastic surgeon works with other
surgeons to help with reconstruction of
soft tissues after tumor removal.

•

A surgical oncologist performs
operations to remove cancer from the
torso, abdomen, and sometimes the
extremities.

•

Physical and occupational
therapists help people recover from
surgery and build strength, mobility, and
resume daily tasks.

•

A medical oncologist treats cancer in
adults using systemic therapy. This person
often leads the overall treatment team.

•

A dietitian or nutritionist helps meet
your nutrition needs during treatment

•

Keep a list of names and contact information
for each member of your team. This will make
it easier for you and anyone involved in your
care to know who to contact with questions or
concerns.

tissue. Over time, the seeds will stop radiating,
but will stay in your body (permanent).

With cryotherapy, a medical gas is passed
through the probe to cause below-freezing
temperatures. This freezes the tumor to destroy
it. With radiofrequency ablation, the probe emits
radio waves to heat the tumor and destroy it.

HDR brachytherapy
High dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy uses
thin needles placed inside the tumor. These
needles are then attached to tubes called
catheters. Radiation is delivered through these
catheters. After treatment, the needles and
catheters are removed.

The probe can be guided into place with a CT
scan, ultrasound, or other imaging tests. The
probe is removed when treatment is done.

Embolization

Other local treatments

Embolization treats tumors by cutting off
their blood supply. It is most commonly used
before surgery to remove a tumor. A catheter
is inserted into an artery and guided to the
tumor. Once in place, beads are inserted to
block the blood flow. In chemoembolization,
the beads are coated with chemotherapy.
Radioembolization uses small radioactive
beads.

Isolated limb infusion
Isolated limb infusion/perfusion is used to treat
sarcoma of the limb. It is a type of regional
limb therapy. It involves delivering anti-cancer
drugs directly into an arm or leg. During
surgery, the flow of blood is stopped for a short
period of time while the drugs are injected into
the blood of the limb (infusion). This limits the
effect of chemotherapy on the rest of the body.
This option should only be done at centers
or hospitals with experience in regional limb
therapy.

Systemic therapy
A cancer treatment that affects the whole body
is called systemic. Chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and immunotherapy are types of
systemic therapy. Many systemic therapies are
liquids that are injected into a vein or under the
skin with a needle. Others are taken by mouth
as a pill.

Ablation
Ablation uses extreme cold or extreme heat
to destroy cancer cells. It can destroy small
tumors with little harm to nearby tissue.

Chemotherapy

There are 2 types of thermal ablation used to
destroy cancer cells:




Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
normal cells. There are many chemotherapy
drugs that might be used to treat soft tissue
sarcoma. More than one drug may be used.

Cryotherapy kills cancer cells by freezing
them with a very cold substance.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) kills
cancer cells by heating them with highenergy radio waves.

Most chemotherapy is given in cycles of
treatment days followed by days of rest. This
allows the body to recover between cycles.
Cycles vary in length depending on which

cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Chemoradiation

Phases

Treatment that combines chemotherapy with
radiation therapy is called chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy may improve how well radiation
works, and that is why they are sometimes
used together. It is a combination of systemic
and local therapies.

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.


Targeted therapy


Targeted therapy is drug therapy that focuses
on specific or unique features of cancer cells.
Targeted therapy isn’t used for every sarcoma.
It might be used alone or with chemotherapy.



Immunotherapy
The immune system is the body’s natural
defense against infection and disease. It is a
complex network of cells, tissues, and organs.
Immunotherapy increases the activity of your
immune system. By doing so, it improves your
body’s ability to find and destroy cancer cells.
Pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and nivolumab
are types of immunotherapy.



Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Finding a clinical trial

Frequently asked questions

In the United States

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.

Radiation therapy is a local treatment that
is often used before or after surgery to
lower the risk of the tumor growing back
after surgery.
It can also be used alone as a main
(primary) treatment, or to relieve pain and
discomfort caused by the tumor(s).
The two main types of radiation therapy
are external beam radiation therapy
(EBRT) and brachytherapy.
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT), image-guided radiation therapy
(IGRT), proton therapy, intraoperative
radiation therapy (IORT), and stereotactic
body radiation therapy (SBRT) are types
of EBRT.
SBRT uses high-energy radiation beams
to treat metastatic tumors in five or fewer
sessions.
If radiation therapy is planned, ask your
doctor if proton therapy is an option.

Other local treatments

alphabetically below.

options for soft tissue sarcomas
in the arms, legs, outer torso,



head, and neck. Treatment is
based on the type and location of
the tumor, as well as the cancer
stage.



Many types of soft tissue sarcoma can form in
the head, neck, limbs, or outer torso. The limbs
include the arms, legs, and thighs. The outer
torso includes the chest, back, buttocks, and
abdomen.



Head and neck soft tissue sarcomas are
similar to sarcomas in other parts of the body.
But they can be hard to treat because of the
location. The tumor is likely to be close to
bones, muscles, and nerves, making surgery
more difficult. Areas of the head and neck that
could be affected include:






Neck and throat such as the larynx and
pharynx



Face and scalp



Sinus and nasal (nose) cavities

Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS)
begins in the soft tissue that surrounds
organs and other tissues. It commonly
occurs in the thigh, but can be found in
the arms, legs, or torso.
Angiosarcoma begins in the cells that
line blood vessels or lymph vessels.
These often occur in the limbs but can
occur anywhere.
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
occurs in the layer of tissue right under
the skin. It starts as a nodule or thickening
that grows slowly.
Epithelioid sarcoma begins as a slowgrowing, firm lump in the deep soft tissue
or skin of the arms, hands, or fingers. It
may also occur in the legs, torso, or head
and neck. It is usually painless but tends
to spread and return after treatment.
Leiomyosarcoma is cancer of smooth
muscle cells that can arise almost
anywhere in the body.
Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma
begins in fat cells. It usually occurs in the
thigh but can be found in the outer torso
and buttocks.
Atypical lipomatous tumors (ALT)/
well-differentiated liposarcoma
(WDLS) have cells that look like fat cells
under a microscope. They tend to grow
more slowly than poorly differentiated
or undifferentiated cancer cells. When
these grow in the extremities, they are not
considered cancerous.

Sarcomas in the limbs, outer torso, head, or neck » Stage 1A/1B

Stage 1A/1B

Surgery has risks

A stage 1 sarcoma in the outer torso or limbs
may be small or large in size. Cancer has not
spread to nearby lymph nodes or to distant
sites. Stage 1 is further grouped into stage 1A
and stage 1B. These stages are low-grade. This
means they are not expected to grow quickly.

Those with some types of soft tissue
sarcoma have a greater risk of
complications from surgery. Also,
sarcomas in the face, head, or neck
might be more difficult to remove. Ask
your doctor about the risks of surgery,
what will be removed, and what this
means in terms of your function and
recovery.

Surgery is the recommended treatment for
stage 1A/1B sarcomas in these areas. If there
is a serious risk of complications from surgery,
shrinking the tumor with radiation therapy first
may be recommended.
The goal of surgery is to remove the sarcoma
with a cancer-free surgical margin (R0).
However, to avoid cutting nerves and blood
vessels, your surgeon may not be able to
remove a large enough surgical margin. In
this case, there is a higher chance that cancer
cells will be left behind. Using a microscope, a
pathologist will examine the surgical margin for
cancer cells.

Follow-up care
A physical exam is recommended every 3 to 6
months for the first 2 to 3 years after treatment.
After that, visits are spaced out to once per
year.
Your doctor will consider an imaging study
after treatment to serve as your baseline. You
may have periodic imaging of the surgery site.
This is on a case-by-case basis, based on the
risk of recurrence. If the tumor is in an area
that is easy to see and examine, imaging may
not be needed.

If the sarcoma was completely resected (R0),
you can start follow-up care.
If not enough tissue around the sarcoma was
removed (R1 or R2), you may have a second
surgery or radiation therapy. Radiation therapy
is a very good option for stage 1B tumors. For
stage 1A tumors, observation is also an option.
Observation is a period of scheduled follow-up
testing to watch for signs of cancer spread or
return.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Soft Tissue Sarcoma, 2024

If cancer is likely to spread to your lungs, you
may get scans of your chest.
After surgery to remove a soft tissue sarcoma,
you should be evaluated for rehabilitation
services. Such services include occupational
and physical therapy. Occupational therapy
can help with daily life skills. Physical therapy
helps your body move and function.

Sarcomas in the limbs, outer torso, head, or neck » Stage 2, 3, and some stage 4

Stage 2, 3, and some
stage 4

Resectable with good function
Stage 2
Surgery is the main treatment for resectable
stage 2 sarcomas. Radiation therapy may be
given before or after surgery.

The following information applies to stage 2
and stage 3 sarcomas in the limbs or outer
torso. It also applies to stage 4 sarcomas that
have spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not to
distant sites. There is no distant metastasis.

When given first, radiation can reduce the
tumor size and improve the outcome of
surgery. When given after surgery, radiation
can lower the risk of the cancer returning. It
may also improve how well your limb works
after surgery. One downside is that, if done
before surgery or before the surgical wound
has fully healed, it will likely slow healing of the
wound.

Treatment for these stages is based on
whether surgery can be done. If the tumor can
be safely removed and you will have good use
of the limb or area, it is considered resectable.
Surgery might not be the first treatment.
The tumor may be too large, or removing
it may limit the use of a limb or other body
part. Surgery may also cause health-related
problems. Therefore, treatment is grouped
into:


Resectable with good function,



Resectable with poor function, and



Unresectable.

Stage 3 and some stage 4
Possible treatment pathways for stage 3 and
non-metastatic stage 4 sarcomas include:




All options include surgery to remove the
tumor. Other treatment is often given before or
after surgery.





Treatment before surgery may include
chemoradiation, radiation therapy, or systemic
therapy. The goal is to shrink the tumor before
surgery.

Surgery → radiation therapy or
chemoradiation
Radiation therapy → surgery → possibly

systemic therapies for non-specific types of
soft tissue sarcoma are listed in Guide 1.
Preferred systemic therapies for specific tumor
types are listed in Guide 2.
Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), atypical
lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated
liposarcoma (ALT/WDLS), and clear
cell sarcomas do not usually respond to
chemotherapy.

Unresectable or resectable with
poor function

Amputation is the removal of a limb or
other body part. Amputation may be
considered if a limb will not work after
surgery. A surgeon who is an expert
in soft tissue sarcoma should be
consulted to determine if amputation
is necessary or if limb salvage is
possible.

Surgery may not be a first treatment option for
stage 2, 3, or non-metastatic stage 4 sarcomas.
This is often due to the tumor location and/or
size. One of the below treatments is usually
used first to shrink the tumor. If it works well,
surgery may be possible.


Radiation therapy



Chemoradiation



Systemic therapy



Isolated limb infusion

If the cancer is causing symptoms, palliative
surgery or other best supportive care may be
recommended for relief from symptoms.

After treatment, your doctors will assess if you
are able to have surgery with good results.
Good results include a surgical margin larger
than 1 cm, cancer-free margins, and good use
of your limb or other body part. This means a
tumor that was unresectable is now resectable.

Follow-up care
A physical exam is recommended every 3
to 6 months for the first 2 to 3 years after
treatment. For the following 2 years, exams
are recommended every 6 months. After that,
visits are spaced out to once per year. After 10
years, the risk of recurrence is very low. Talk
to your treatment team about how long you
should have testing.

If the cancer becomes resectable, see
treatment information under “Resectable with
good function” on page 26.
If the cancer becomes resectable but surgery
would cause a loss of function, either radiation
therapy or radical surgery (eg, amputation)
may be recommended.

Your doctor will order imaging when treatment
ends. These scans will serve as a baseline to
compare against future imaging results. You
will continue to get scans of the site where the
primary tumor was. How often depends on
how likely the cancer is to return.

If the cancer remains unresectable after
treatment, options include:

distant areas, or both. Sarcomas do not often
spread to lymph nodes.

Widespread cancer

The following information applies to sarcomas
found in distant areas when first diagnosed.
Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer.

If the metastases are widespread, the goal of
care is palliative. Palliative care does not try to
cure the cancer. It is used to relieve pain and
discomfort, to reduce symptoms caused by the
cancer, and to extend life. Palliative treatment
options include:

If there are only a few small metastatic tumors
that can be treated with local therapies,
treatment according to “Resectable with good
function” on page 26 is recommended. Your
treatment team will consider the following
options for treating the metastatic tumors:

Follow-up care

Supportive care is treatment to relieve
symptoms of cancer and side effects from
treatment. Supportive care is not cancer
treatment. It might include pain relief,
emotional or spiritual support, financial aid, or
family counseling. Tell your care team how you
are feeling and about any side effects.

A recurrence is the return of cancer after a
cancer-free period. Treatment options depend
on the location of the new growth. If sarcoma
returns to the area where it started, it is called
local recurrence. Local recurrence is often
treated as if it were newly diagnosed.

The cancer may return to areas far from where
it started. If the cancer is widespread, the
main goal of care is not to cure the cancer. The
aim is to control its growth, extend your life,

or pelvis are usually treated with
surgery. Together these areas are
called the inner trunk or torso.

If treatment before surgery is being
considered, an image-guided core needle
biopsy is needed. Otherwise, a biopsy may
not be performed. An experienced sarcoma
pathologist should review the biopsy samples.

The retroperitoneum is the area in the
back of the abdomen. Organs found in the
retroperitoneum include the adrenal glands,
aorta, kidneys (and ureters), part of the
pancreas, rectum, and parts of the stomach
and colon.

If systemic therapy before surgery is planned,
the drug(s) used will depend on the subtype
of soft tissue sarcoma. Preferred systemic
therapies for non-specific types of soft tissue
sarcoma are listed in Guide 1 on page 28.
Preferred systemic therapies for specific tumor
types are listed in Guide 2 on page 29.

Liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma are the
most common types of soft tissue sarcoma
found in the retroperitoneum.
Tumors in the retroperitoneum tend to
grow very large before causing symptoms.
They tend to push against or invade nearby
structures such as veins and arteries. The size
of the tumor and how close it is to major blood
vessels may make surgery difficult.

After surgery, a pathologist examines the
surgical margin for cancer cells. Depending on
the results, more treatment may be needed.
For any sarcoma thought to be at high risk of
spreading, systemic therapy will be considered
after surgery.

A biopsy is needed to confirm soft tissue
sarcoma in the retroperitoneum.
The organs of the abdomen and chest,
such as the lungs and the bowel, are known as
visceral organs. They include any soft organ,
but not lymph nodes.

The best possible surgical outcome is called
complete resection or negative margin
resection. Doctors call this R0. It means that

organs, veins, arteries, and other tissues,
complete resection is not always possible.
If the surgeon removes all of the visible
tumor but microscopic cancer cells remain
in the margin, it is an R1 positive margin.
An R2 positive margin means that all of the

happen when the tumor is close to important
structures, like large blood vessels or nerves.
A small number of those with R1 or R2 surgery
results may benefit from radiation therapy after
surgery.

A tumor that cannot be safely removed with
surgery is called unresectable. These include
tumors that involve vital structures and tumors
whose removal could cause complications or
death. Overall health also plays a role. You
should also be healthy enough to have major
abdominal surgery.

If the tumor was not totally removed (R2
positive margin), a second surgery to remove
the remaining cancer may be an option. This is
generally only considered if complete resection
is thought to be possible. You should also be
healthy enough to have the surgery.

Stage 4 tumors can be any size (T) and any
grade (G). Cancer has spread to nearby lymph
nodes (this is not common) or to distant areas
(M1).

Follow-up care

A biopsy will be done first to stage the tumor.
An experienced sarcoma pathologist should
review any biopsy and tissue samples.

When treatment is over, testing is used to
look for signs of recurrence. Testing includes
physical exams and imaging. For imaging,
computed tomography (CT) is generally
preferred for sarcomas in these areas. MRI is
also a recommended option. In some cases,
positron emission tomography (PET) may be
combined with CT.

If the tumor is slow-growing and not causing
symptoms, observation without treatment is
one recommended option. Sometimes an
unresectable tumor can become resectable.
An attempt might be made to shrink the
tumor using systemic therapy and/or radiation
therapy. Imaging tests will be used to see if
the tumor has shrunk and if surgery is now
possible.

Imaging and a physical exam are
recommended every 3 to 6 months for the first
2 to 3 years after treatment. For the following
two years, testing is spaced to every 6 months.
After that, testing is recommended once per
year.

If the tumor becomes resectable, see
“Resectable” on page 34. If the tumor stays
unresectable or gets worse, options include:

If the cancer is likely to spread to the lungs,
you may get imaging tests of your chest.

Also known as aggressive fibromatosis or
desmoid-type fibromatosis, desmoid tumors
aren’t considered cancerous because they
do not spread in the body. But they can be
persistent in the area where they start. If they
recur (return), they return to the same area as
the primary (first) tumor.

If the tumor is causing pain or other symptoms,
drug therapy may be an option. This depends
on where the tumor is in the body and the
safety of the drug.

Testing
Your doctor will ask about your health history
and perform a physical exam. A sample of the
tumor will also be removed for testing. This
is called a biopsy. Imaging of the tumor may
also be needed. Either computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
recommended.

If the desmoid tumor worsens somewhat but
your symptoms aren’t bad, your doctor may
recommend continuing observation. However,
if growth continues and causes severe
symptoms or problems, treatment is needed.
See “Progression” on the next page.
Large tumors that are causing problems will
be treated based on the location of the tumor,
if it is causing pain, or if it interferes with
movement.

Hereditary syndromes
Desmoid tumors often occur for unknown
reasons. However, some rare syndromes
increase the risk of cancer and desmoid
tumors. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
can cause hundreds to thousands of polyps
to form in the colon and rectum. The polyps
start as noncancerous growths, but over time
they can turn into cancer. In addition to bowel
polyps, those with Gardner syndrome have

reduce fever, swelling, pain, and redness.
Sulindac (Clinoril) and celecoxib (Celebrex)
are NSAIDs that are commonly prescribed for
people with symptoms. Celecoxib can cause
heart issues or put those with heart issues at
greater risk for side effects.

Treatment for desmoid tumors often includes
systemic therapy and/or ablation. Surgery and
radiation therapy are less commonly used.
Each of these is discussed in more detail next.
The best treatment(s) for you will depend on
the location of the tumor.

Ablation

Systemic therapy

Ablation uses extreme cold or extreme heat
to destroy desmoid tumors. It can help control
the size of the tumor. Types of ablation include
radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryotherapy,
and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).
These procedures are typically done at
specialty hospitals or health care centers that
specialize in treating desmoid tumors.

There are different types of systemic therapy
used to treat desmoid tumors. Options include
chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), and a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI).
Recommended systemic therapies for desmoid
tumors are listed in Guide 3.

Desmoid tumors » Follow-up care

Surgery

It is not recommended for desmoid tumors in
the abdomen or retroperitoneum, except under
special circumstances.

Desmoid tumors are hard to completely
remove. They also frequently grow back
after surgery. For these reasons, surgery is
generally not a first-line treatment, unless
agreed upon by a team of experts.

The retroperitoneum is the area in the back of
the abdomen. Organs in the retroperitoneum
include the adrenal glands, aorta, kidneys (and
ureters), part of the pancreas, rectum, and
parts of the stomach and colon.

Surgery might not be considered if there is
risk of serious complications. It may be too
dangerous based on the tumor location or your
overall health.

Follow-up care

If surgery is planned and the results are very
good, it is called complete resection. Doctors
write this as R0. Observation is recommended.

After treatment, you will be monitored for
symptoms. A change in symptoms may be
a sign of tumor growth. Report any new or
worsening symptoms to your doctor. Follow-up
tests are used to see if the desmoid tumor is
growing or has returned.

If microscopic cancer cells remain after
surgery, it is called R1. Options may include
observation, another surgery, and radiation
therapy to kill leftover cancer cells.

Imaging
Imaging with CT or MRI every 3 to 6 months
for 2 to 3 years is recommended. After that,
imaging is spaced out to once or twice per
year. Depending on the location of the tumor,
ultrasound may also be used for long-term
follow-up.

If much of the cancer could not be removed, it
is called R2. Options may include:


Radiation therapy



Systemic therapy



Ablation procedures



Observation

Rehabilitation
You should receive rehabilitation services if
needed. This may include occupational and/or
physical therapy.

If these treatments fail, radical surgery may
be considered. Radical surgery could involve
removing large areas of tissue and/or organs
affected by the tumor. However, a main goal of
treatment is to maintain function. Amputation is
almost never considered.

Radiation therapy
In general, radiation therapy is only
recommended for desmoid tumors in the limbs
(arms and legs), outer torso, head, neck,
abdominal wall, pelvis, trunk, and chest cavity.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare type
of sarcoma of the skeletal muscle. Skeletal
muscles are those that we can control or
move. RMS can also be found in parts of the
body that don’t normally have skeletal muscle.
Before we are born, cells called
rhabdomyoblasts begin to form. These cells
eventually become skeletal muscle. But
sometimes rhabdomyoblasts develop into
RMS. RMS is more common in children
because it starts in rhabdomyoblasts.
Risk factors for RMS include Li-Fraumeni

RMS is divided into pleomorphic and nonpleomorphic. Non-pleomorphic RMS is more
common and usually affects children. It
includes the embryonal, alveolar, and spindle

Treatment

Non-pleomorphic RMS

Seeking treatment at a cancer center
experienced in treating non-pleomorphic RMS
is strongly recommended. Treatment planning
should involve a pediatric oncologist as well as
medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists.

This type of RMS is mostly seen in children. It
includes the following subtypes:


Alveolar



Embryonal



Spindle cell/sclerosing

Treatment often involves a combination of
surgery, systemic therapy, and radiation
therapy.

Alveolar RMS (or ARMS) is often found in
skeletal muscle of the limbs, but can be
found in the torso, head, and neck. It is more
aggressive than embryonal RMS (or ERMS).
ERMS tends to occur in the head, neck,
bladder, vagina, or in or around the prostate
and testicles.

At this time, the following chemotherapy
regimens are preferred for systemic therapy:




Spindle cell/sclerosing includes tumors with
VGLL2-related fusions, intraosseous (bone)
tumors, and tumors with MYOD1 mutation.
The aggressiveness of the tumor is directly
related to the mutation present.

VAI regimen: vincristine, dactinomycin,
ifosfamide

If chemotherapy with one of these regimens
works very well, sometimes maintenance
chemotherapy is given to maintain the good
results. This depends on the aggressiveness
of the tumor.

Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcomas
that are present at birth or that occur shortly
after birth often are less aggressive than other
rhabdomyosarcomas.

If treatment with the VAC or VAI regimen is
not possible, there are other recommended
options for systemic therapy.

Seek treatment at a cancer center
with expertise in the management
of pediatric cancers, including nonpleomorphic RMS.

The prognosis (outlook) for pleomorphic RMS
is typically poor. This type is usually excluded
from RMS and soft tissue sarcoma clinical

tumor (ALT)/well-differentiated
liposarcoma (WDLS) is one of five
major types of liposarcoma.

After surgery, tumor cells may remain in the
normal tissue surrounding the tumor. But more
treatment is not typically needed because
these tumors do not usually spread within the
body. If the tumor returns, either observation or
another surgery is recommended.

This complex name reflects tumors that look
the same through the microscope but act
differently depending on where they form.
Tumors that develop in the arms or legs may
return to the same area after a very long
time (years to decades). They rarely develop
dedifferentiation (explained below) and even
more rarely cause death. Some sarcoma
doctors prefer the name “ALT” for these
tumors, since they are not very aggressive.

Radiation therapy is not recommended for
atypical lipomatous tumors because they are
considered benign. See “Follow-up” on the
next page for information on surveillance after
surgery.

Tumors that develop in the retroperitoneum
often return to the same area, often develop
dedifferentiation (see below), and eventually
(years to decades later) cause death. Most
sarcoma doctors prefer the name “WDLS” for
these more aggressive tumors.

If there are signs of dedifferentiation, the same
treatment used for other soft tissue sarcomas
that form in these areas is recommended. See
Part 4 of this guide, “Sarcomas in the limbs,
outer torso, head, or neck.”

Retroperitoneum or scrotum

While rare, over time ALT/WDLS can transform
into a related type of liposarcoma called
dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The features
signaling this change can be diagnosed by
a pathologist who examines tissue with a
microscope, or in imaging studies.

For WDLS that forms in the retroperitoneum or
scrotum, treatment is not guided by whether
there is dedifferentiation. The same treatment
used for other soft tissue sarcomas that form
in these areas is recommended. See Part 5 of
this guide, “Sarcomas inside the torso.”

Unlike ALT/WDLS, dedifferentiated
liposarcoma may be fast-growing. It is also
more likely to return after treatment and/
or spread to distant areas of the body
(metastasize).

Follow-up
Surveillance after treatment includes physical
exams and imaging of the area where the
tumor formed. Suggested schedules for these
tests are provided below. But you may need
them more or less often. This will depend on
the risk of the cancer returning.

We want your
feedback!

A physical exam is recommended every 6
to 12 months for the first two years after
treatment. After that, one exam per year is
recommended.

Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.

How often imaging is needed will be
individualized. Your doctor will consider the
location (how easily it can be examined without
imaging) and how likely the cancer is to return.
Imaging of the chest to look for cancer spread
is not recommended unless dedifferentiation
was present.

Words to know
ablation
A treatment that destroys very small tumors
with heat, cold, lasers, or chemicals. Also
called ablative therapy.

Desmoid tumor
A mass of fibrous cells that grows into nearby
tissue and rarely spreads to distant sites
(often not cancer). Also known as aggressive
fibromatosis.

biopsy
A procedure that removes fluid or tissue
samples to be tested for disease.

distant recurrence
Cancer that has come back after treatment
and is found in a part of the body far from the
first (primary) tumor.

brachytherapy
A treatment with radiation from an object
placed near or in the tumor. Also called internal
radiation.

embolization
A treatment that cuts off blood supply to
tumors with beads inserted into an artery.

chemoembolization
A cancer treatment with chemotherapy-coated
beads that block blood supply to tumors.

external beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
A cancer treatment with radiation delivered
from a machine outside the body.

chemoradiation
Treatment with a combination of chemotherapy
and radiation therapy.

familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
A hereditary condition that causes many
abnormal growths (polyps) to form in the
bowel. Increases the risk of sarcoma.

chemotherapy
Drugs that kill cancer cells by damaging or
disrupting the making of the genetic code.

Gardner syndrome
A hereditary syndrome that causes bowel
polyps, abnormal bony growths, and skin
and soft tissue tumors. A type of familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

computed tomography (CT)
A test that uses x-rays from many angles to
make a picture of the insides of the body.
contrast
A substance put into your body to make clearer
pictures during imaging tests.

grade
A rating of how quickly a cancer is expected to
grow. Based on how abnormal the cancer cells
look under a microscope.

core needle biopsy
A procedure that removes tissue samples with
a hollow needle. Also called core biopsy.

histology
The structure of cells, tissue, and organs as
viewed under a microscope.

cryotherapy
A type of ablation therapy that kills cancer cells
by freezing them.

Words to know

intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT)
Treatment with radiation that uses small
beams of different strengths based on the
thickness of the tissue. A type of EBRT.
