About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Head and Neck Cancers Version 2.2024 –
December 8, 2023.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)

The pharynx (said fair-inks) has 3 parts:

Nasopharynx



Oropharynx

Hypopharynx

Cancer can be found in any part of the
pharynx. This book will focus on cancer of
the nasopharynx, also called nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC). The nasopharynx is a
small, tube-shaped structure above the soft
part of the back of the mouth (soft palate) that
connects the nasal cavity to the oropharynx.
The nasal cavity is the space inside the nose.
It lies above the bone that forms the roof of
the mouth (hard palate) and curves down at
the back to join the throat. The oropharynx
includes the back of the roof of the mouth (soft
palate), the tonsils, the side and back walls of
the throat, and the base of the tongue found in
the throat.

mouth (pharynx).

The pharynx
The pharynx is part of the throat and found
inside the neck. It is a hollow, muscular
tube that starts behind the nose (nasal
cavity) and opens into the voice box (larynx)
and esophagus (the tube that goes to the
stomach).

Head and neck cancer

It is strongly recommended, when
possible, for those with head and
neck cancers to be treated at a
high-volume center or hospital
that has experience in their type of
cancer.

Head and neck cancers are a group of cancers
that arise in the head or neck area of the body.
Cancer is named and treated based on the
tumor location or where the cancer started.
Cancer can occur in the

Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a rare cancer
that most often occurs in people from parts of
Asia, Native America, and North Africa. Most
NPCs start in the squamous cells that form the
surface lining of the nasopharynx. Normally,
these are thin, flat cells and are similar to the
top layer of skin and surface lining of some
other parts of the body such as the lungs and
esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
is the most common type of nasopharyngeal
cancer and is the focus of this book.

Upper part of the throat near the nasal
cavity (nasopharynx),
Voice box (larynx), or
Lower part of the throat near the larynx
(hypopharynx).

More information on mouth cancer and throat
(oropharyngeal) cancer can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Cancer cells form a tumor called a primary
tumor within the area of the nasopharynx, the
part of the throat connecting the back of the
nose (nasal cavity) to the back of the mouth
(the pharynx). A tumor can grow into nearby
tissue. Cancer cells often spread to lymph
nodes in the neck, and less frequently to the
lungs.
It's often difficult to recognize nasopharyngeal
cancer because the symptoms are similar
to other less serious conditions. Also, many
people with nasopharyngeal cancer don't have
any symptoms until the cancer reaches an
advanced stage.

Testing for NPC » Test results

Treatment planning starts with



testing. This chapter presents an
overview of the tests you might



receive and what to expect.



Test results
Results from medical history, physical
examination, imaging studies, and biopsy will
be used to determine your treatment plan.
Treatment will be based on these findings. It
is important you understand what these tests
mean. Ask questions and keep copies of your
test results. Online patient portals are a great
way to access your test results. Discuss your
results with your health care provider (HCP).



Keep these things in mind:








Find out where your insurance allows you
to be treated. Seek out a comprehensive
cancer center with doctors who are
experts in evaluating and treating
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). You'll
want to do this step early on.
Choose a friend, family member, or peer
who can drive you to appointments,
provide meals, or offer emotional support
during diagnosis and treatment.
Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.
Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nasopharyngeal Cancer, 2024

Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.
Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.
Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician (PCP)
informed of changes to this list. You are
encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop.
They are great partners in your care.
In your contact list, include information on
the exact type of cancer you have, as well
as any treatments you've received and
the date each treatment started.

Testing for NPC » General health tests

For possible tests, see Guide 1.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and
when it happened. Bring a list of old and new
medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Some supplements interact with and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

General health tests
Some general health tests are described next.
You will not have all of these tests.

Guide 1
Tests for treatment planning
Medical history, tobacco and alcohol use history, and physical exam, including complete head and
neck exam. Mirror exam if needed. Screen for depression.

Testing for NPC » General health tests

Family history

Physical exam

NPC most often occurs in those from parts of
Asia, Native America, and North Africa. Head
and neck cancers are not inherited from your
biological parents. However, some cancers
and other diseases can run in families. Your
care team will ask about the health history of
family members who are blood relatives. This
information is called a family history. Ask family
members on both sides of your family about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific
type of cancer or where the cancer started, if it
is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic
testing.

During a physical exam, your health care
provider may:




Check your height and weight



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat





Tobacco and alcohol use history

Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate

Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched.
Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin.

Complete head and neck exam

Tobacco and alcohol use are known risk
factors for developing head and neck cancer
and can limit how well treatment works. Their
use can affect survival. You will be asked
about your tobacco and alcohol use history
and asked to avoid tobacco and limit alcohol
use during treatment. Speak to your care team
if you have any questions or concerns.

A physical exam will include the head and
neck. Since the oropharynx is found inside the
throat, some parts are not easy to see when
you open your mouth. A health care provider
might use a special mirror or fiberoptic scope
to look at these areas.

Dental exam
It is important to tell your dentist about your
head and neck cancer and to have regular
dental cleanings and checkups. Head and
neck cancer and its treatment can affect the
health of your jaw, teeth, and gums. If you
need any dental work or procedures, they
might be recommended before starting certain
treatments.

Testing for NPC » General health tests

Distress screening

Hearing test

It is normal to have strong feelings about being
diagnosed with cancer, and your feelings can
change from day to day and week to week.
Talk to your care team and those whom you
feel most comfortable about how you are
feeling. There are services and people who
can help you. Support and counseling are
available. Many treatment teams include mind
and body therapists who can help.

A hearing test shows if there is any hearing
loss, and if so, the type of hearing loss, how
severe it is, and what might have caused it. An
audiogram is a graph showing the results of a
pure-tone hearing test. Tumors in the head and
neck can affect hearing. Treatment of head
and neck tumors can also affect hearing.

Dealing with a cancer diagnosis can be
stressful and may cause further distress.
Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You
may also experience depression, anxiety, and
sleep issues. Your treatment team will screen
your level of distress. This is part of your
cancer care.

You might meet with a nutrition expert before
starting treatment. A nutritionist or dietician
can suggest the best foods and fluids for you.
It is important that you receive adequate and
sustained nutrition before you start treatment.

Nutrition assessment

Speech and swallowing
assessment
You might visit with a speech or swallowing
therapist who will test your ability to swallow
and speak before and after treatment.

Eye exam

Performance status

Sometimes, nasopharyngeal cancer can
affect the eyes. An eye exam might be
recommended before starting treatment.

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
self-care tasks. It is one factor taken into
consideration when choosing a treatment plan.
Your preferences about treatment are always
important.

Endocrine tests
Radiation therapy to the head and neck can
affect endocrine (hormone) glands found in the
head and neck, such as thyroid and pituitary
glands. Therefore, blood tests to look at thyroid
endocrine levels might be done before and/or
after treatment.

Testing for NPC » Fertility (all genders) » Preventing pregnancy during treatment

Fertility (all genders)

Preventing pregnancy
during treatment

Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect
your fertility, the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might change your fertility. To preserve your
fertility, you may need to take action before
starting cancer treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options
before starting treatment.

Preventing pregnancy during treatment is
important. Cancer and cancer treatment
can affect the ovaries and damage sperm.
Hormonal birth control may or may not be
recommended, so ask your doctor about
options such as intrauterine devices (IUDs)
and barrier methods. Types of barrier methods
include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps,
and the contraceptive sponge.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want
to have children later in life or aren’t really
sure at the moment. Fertility and reproductive
specialists can help you sort through what may
be best for your situation.

Those with ovaries
Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing
baby if you are or become pregnant during
treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding at the time of your cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.

More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
“period” may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended during and after treatment.
Consult your doctor for the best time to plan a
pregnancy.

Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This loss of fertility is related
to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment
type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length.
Talk to your care team about your concerns
and if you are planning a pregnancy.

Testing for NPC » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

If you smoke or vape,
seek help to quit

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of
your body. Imaging tests show the primary
tumor, or where the cancer started, and
look for cancer in other parts of the body. A
radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report
to your health care provider (HCP). It is likely
that the report will be sent directly to you
through your patient portal or patient access
system. You should discuss these results with
your HCP. You will not have all of the following
tests.

A history of smoking or vaping nicotine
increases your chances of developing
head and neck, lung, and other cancers.
Smoking and vaping can limit how well
cancer treatment works and prevent
wound healing. They also greatly increase
your chances of having side effects during
and after surgery. Cannabis use might
also affect the amount of anesthesia used
during surgery.

Contrast material

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that
makes you want to keep smoking and
vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging
for most people who smoke or vape. The
stress of having cancer may make it even
harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask
your care team about counseling and
medicines to help you quit. In head and
neck cancers, stopping smoking or vaping
is essential to maximize the chance for
cure and minimize side effects.

Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that
help enhance and improve the images of
several organs and structures in the body. It is
used to make the pictures clearer. The contrast
is not permanent and will leave your body in
your urine immediately after the test. The types
of contrast vary and are different for CT and
MRI.
Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

Testing for NPC » Imaging tests

CT scan

PET scan

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. A CT scan of your head,
neck, and chest may be one of the tests to
look for cancer. In most cases, contrast will be
used.

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans. However, not all tumors will
appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright
spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain,
heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on
PET. Inflammation or infection can also show
up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is
combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Because of the very strong
magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the
technologist if you have any metal in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked
to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as
the technician collects the images. Contrast is
often used.

FDG-PET/CT
An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made of
fluoride and a simple form of sugar called
glucose. You cannot eat or drink for at least
4 hours before the scan. This scan is most
helpful when other imaging results are unclear.
It may help find cancer in lymph nodes and
distant sites. If it clearly shows cancer in the
bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride PET/
CT may not be needed. FDG-PET/CT can
be done at the same time as a CT used for
diagnosis.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nasopharyngeal Cancer, 2024

Ultrasound
Ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for
pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer)
will be held and moved on your neck using
gel. Ultrasound is painless and does not use
x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed.
Ultrasound is good at showing small areas
of cancer that may be in lymph nodes.
Sometimes, an ultrasound or CT is used to
guide a fine-needle biopsy (FNB).
15

Testing for NPC » Biopsy » Biomarker testing

Biomarker testing

Panoramic dental x-ray
A panoramic dental x-ray or panoramic x-ray
(Panorex) uses a very small dose of radiation
to capture the entire mouth in one image,
including the teeth, upper and lower jaw,
and surrounding structures and tissues. It
is commonly performed by dentists and oral
surgeons in everyday practice and may be
used to plan treatment for dentures, braces,
extractions, and implants.

Biomarker tumor testing includes tests of
genes or their products (proteins). It identifies
the presence or absence of mutations and
certain proteins that might suggest treatment.
This information is used to choose the best
treatment for you. It is sometimes called
molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor
sequencing, gene expression profiling, or
genomic testing.
Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly
packaged into what is called a chromosome.
Chromosomes contain most of the genetic
information in a cell. Normal human cells
contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total
of 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome
contains thousands of genes. Genes are
coded instructions for the proteins your cells
make. Most genes contain information about a
specific protein. A mutation is when something
goes wrong in the genetic code.

Biopsy
A biopsy removes a sample of tissue or fluid.
Samples removed during a biopsy or surgery
will be sent to a pathologist, an expert in
examining cells using a microscope (called
cytology) to confirm the presence of cancer.
The pathologist will determine the cancer
subtype called tumor histology.
A fine-needle aspiration (FNA), fine-needle
biopsy (FNB), and core needle biopsy (CNB)
use needles of different sizes to remove a
sample of tumor or lymph node. An ultrasound
or CT scan might be used to guide a lymph
node biopsy.

Epstein-Barr virus
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common virus
that causes infectious mononucleosis. It
remains dormant or inactive in most people.
Cancer caused by EBV is called EBV-related
cancer. Most nasopharyngeal cancers are
EBV-related. A sample of your tumor and/or
blood will be tested for EBV DNA before and
after treatment.

Biopsy of metastasis
Metastasis is the spread of cancer to an area
of the body such as lymph nodes or lung. A
biopsy of the metastasis may be needed to
confirm the presence of cancer. If there is
more than one metastasis, each site may be
biopsied. The type of biopsy used depends on
the location of the suspected metastases and
other factors.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nasopharyngeal Cancer, 2024

MSI-H/dMMR mutation
Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of
DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are
fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.
Some cancers have DNA mutations or

16

Testing for NPC » Biomarker testing

changes that prevent these errors from being
fixed. This is called microsatellite instability
(MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).
When cancer cells have more than a normal
number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H
(microsatellite instability-high). This is often
due to dMMR genes.

More information on HPV can be found in
NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Throat Cancer,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

PD-L1 testing
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an
immune protein. If this protein is expressed
on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause
your immune cells to ignore the cancer and
suppress the anti-tumor immune response. If
your cancer expresses this protein, you might
have treatment that combines chemotherapy
and an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
This is designed to activate your immune
system to better fight off the cancer cells.

Tumor mutational burden
When there are 10 or more mutations per
million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H).
Metastatic or unresectable TMB cancers are
often treated using immunotherapy drugs that
target the proteins called programmed cell
death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed death
ligand 1 (PD-L1).

Tumor HPV testing
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of
viruses that infect the cells on the surface of
skin or on the moist surfaces or inner linings
of some organs and body cavities. HPV
infection usually clears on its own. However,
HPV infections can cause abnormal tissue
growth (warts) and sometimes cancer. Cancer
caused by HPV is called HPV-related cancer.
In cancers of the head and neck, throat cancer
is most often related to HPV. However, HPV
testing might be done in some cases for
nasopharyngeal cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nasopharyngeal Cancer, 2024

Tumor mutation testing
Tumor mutation testing or tumor genomic
aberration testing uses a sample of your tumor
or blood to see if the cancer cells have any
specific DNA mutations. This is a different type
of DNA testing than the genetic testing for
mutations you may have inherited from your
biological parents. In tumor mutation testing,
only the tumor is tested and not the rest of
your body. Some mutations can be targeted
with specific therapies.

(EBV) is called EBV-related cancer. Most
nasopharyngeal cancers are EBV-related.

Nasopharyngeal cancer staging » How NPC is staged

Cancer staging is used to reflect



prognosis and to guide treatment
decisions. It describes the size



and location of the tumor and if
cancer has spread to lymph nodes
or other parts of the body. This
carcinoma (NPC) stages.

How NPC is staged

Staging includes:

A cancer stage is a way to describe the
extent of the cancer at the time you are first
diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to
determine how much cancer is in your body,
where it is located, and what subtype you
have. This is called staging. Cancer staging
is not the same for all cancer types and
locations.





Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned
a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis
and is needed to make treatment decisions. A
prognosis is the course your cancer will likely
take. AJCC is just one type of staging system.

The extent (size) of the tumor (T):
How large is the cancer? Has it grown
into nearby areas?
The spread to nearby lymph nodes
(N): Has the cancer spread to nearby
lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where?

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nasopharyngeal Cancer, 2024

Anatomic – based on extent of cancer
as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node
status (N), and distant metastasis (M).
Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM
and often Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
levels in the blood. The prognostic stage
also includes the assumption that you
are treated with the standard-of-care
approaches.

Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and
pathologic. Cancer staging is often done twice,
before and after surgery. Staging after surgery
provides more specific and accurate details
about the size of the cancer and lymph node
status.

Information gathered during staging:



Biomarker testing: Does the cancer
have any genes or mutations that might
suggest treatment?

Staging is based on a combination of
information to reach a final numbered stage.
Often, not all information is available at the
initial evaluation. More information can be
gathered as treatment begins. Doctors may
explain your cancer stage in different ways
than described next.

chapter explains nasopharyngeal



The spread (metastasis) to distant
sites (M): Has the cancer spread to
distant organs such as the lungs or liver?

20

Nasopharyngeal cancer staging » How NPC is staged

Clinical stage

Pathologic stage

Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before
any treatment. It is based on a physical exam,
biopsy, and imaging tests. An example might
look like cN2 or cM1. In nasopharyngeal
cancer, the clinical stage is based on imaging
and biopsy results. These tests are done
before any treatment as part of an initial
diagnosis.

Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is
determined by examining tissue removed
during surgery. An example might be pN2.
If you are given cancer drug therapy before
surgery, then the stage might add a "y" and
look like ypT3.

How cancer can spread
Nasopharyngeal cancer
can spread to nearby lymph
nodes, and areas such as
the nasal cavity, oropharynx,
hypopharynx, base of the
skull, jaw, and roof of the
mouth.

Nasopharyngeal cancer staging » TNM scores

TNM scores

Numbered stages
Numbered stages are based on TNM scores.
Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with
4 being the most advanced. They might be
written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III,
and stage IV.

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system
is used to stage throat cancer. In this system,
the letters T, N, and M describe different
areas of cancer growth. Based on imaging
and pathology results, a score or number
is assigned to each letter. The higher the
number, the larger the tumor or the more
the cancer has spread. These scores will be
combined to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM
example might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1,
N0, M0.

Other terms might be used instead of
numbered cancer stages.

Resectable – Tumor can be removed
completely with surgery.
Unresectable – Tumor cannot be
removed completely with surgery. The
tumor might involve nearby veins and
arteries or other structures making it
unsafe to remove.
Locoregional or locally advanced
– This refers to a tumor that has spread
to tissue, organs, or lymph nodes in the
head and neck.
Moderately or very advanced
disease – This includes cancer that
has spread to parts of the neck such as
the base of the skull, larynx, oropharynx,
bones and muscles behind the nasal
cavity, jaw, and roof of the mouth. It might
include cancer in the carotid artery.
Metastatic – This is cancer that
has spread to other parts of the body,
including lung and distant lymph
nodes. This might be referred to as
very advanced disease. Not all stage 4
cancers have spread through the blood
and are metastatic.

NPC stages

Guide 2
Nasopharyngeal cancer stages

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) or cancer
starts in the nasopharynx. The following TNM
staging information is used for squamous cell
carcinoma of the nasopharynx. See Guide
2.

Stage 0

• Tis, N0, M0

Stage 1

• T1, N0, M0

T = Tumor

Stage 2

• T0 or T1, N1, M0
• T2, N0 or N1, M0

A tumor can grow into nearby structures. Head
and neck tumors are measured in centimeters
(cm). A baseball is 7 cm, a golf ball is 4 cm,
and a pea is 1 cm.

Stage 3

• T0 or T1 or T2, N2, M0
• T3, N0 or N1 or N2, M0

T0 – No tumor is found, but neck lymph
nodes test positive for Epstein-Barr virus.

Stage 4A

• T4, N0 or N1 or N2, M0
• Any T, N3, M0

Tis – This is carcinoma in situ, meaning
that cancerous cells are found only in the
squamous cell layer.

Stage 4B

• Any T, Any N, M1









T1 – Tumor is confined to the
nasopharynx or has grown into the
oropharynx and/or nasal cavity, but not
into the parapharyngeal space. The
parapharyngeal space is a triangular area
near the pharynx (throat), between the
base of the skull and the hyoid bone (the
bone under the tongue). It is in the deep
tissues of the neck and contains mostly
fat, as well as blood vessels (including the
carotid artery and jugular vein), nerves,
lymph nodes, and parts of the salivary
(spit) gland.





T2 – Tumor has grown into
parapharyngeal space, and/or nearby
soft tissue (muscles such as the
medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, and
prevertebral muscles)

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nasopharyngeal Cancer, 2024

23

T3 – Tumor has grown into bony
structures at the skull (cranial) base,
neck (cervical) vertebra, pterygoid (jaw)
structures, and/or paranasal sinuses. The
base of the skull is between the bottom of
your brain and the structures of your face.
T4 – Tumor has grown inside the skull,
cranial nerves, hypopharynx, eye (orbit)
bones, and/or parotid (spit) gland, and/
or grown into the area beyond the lateral
pterygoid (jaw) muscle.

Nasopharyngeal cancer staging » NPC stages

N = Regional lymph node



There are hundreds of lymph nodes
throughout your body. They work as filters to
help fight infection and remove harmful things
from your body. The head and neck contain
a network of more than 300 nodes. They are
bound together with muscles nerves, and
blood and lymph vessels. Most head and neck
tumors spread to neck lymph nodes. Regional
lymph nodes are found near the tumor. Cancer
found in a regional lymph node is a lymph
node metastasis. This is different than a distant
metastasis, which is found far from the main
tumor in the neck.







N0 – No regional lymph node metastasis
is found.
N1 – Metastasis of 6 cm or smaller is
found inside 1 lymph node.
N2 – Metastasis of 6 cm or smaller is
found inside 1 or more lymph nodes on
both sides of the neck, above the cricoid.
The cricoid is the ring-shaped cartilage of
the larynx.
N3 – Metastasis of larger than 6 cm is
found inside 1 or more lymph nodes, or
an involved lymph node (of any size) is
found below the cricoid.

Lymph nodes in the head
and neck
There are over 300 lymph nodes
in the head and neck. Most
tumors spread to nearby lymph
nodes.

Staging is only one part of treatment
decision-making.
The head and neck contain a network of
more than 300 lymph nodes. They are
connected by lymph channels, which

Nasopharyngeal cancer is usually

Depending on your diagnosis, your team might
include the following specialists:

treated with a combination of
radiation therapy and systemic



therapy called chemoradiation.


This chapter describes an
overview of treatment options
and what to expect. Together, you



and your care team will choose a
treatment plan that is best for you.



Care team
Those with head and cancer should seek
treatment at experienced cancer centers.



Treating cancer takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementation of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.





Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional issues. The anxiety a
person feels when diagnosed with cancer
might be managed by a social worker
in some cancer centers. They, or other
designated professionals, can help
navigate the complexities of financial and
insurance stresses.

Help your care team understand:

3 How you feel
3 What you need
3 What is working and what is not
Keep a list of names and contact
information for each member of your team.
This will make it easier for you and anyone
involved in your care to know whom to
contact with questions or concerns.

Spiritual care specialists identify and
support those with spiritual distress or
unmet spiritual needs.

Get to know your care team and
help them get to know you.

Smoking cessation specialists
can provide medication and counseling
for those who would like to stop using
tobacco or nicotine products.

Treating nasopharyngeal cancer » Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

EBRT
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside the body to aim radiation at
the tumor(s) or areas of the body.

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, electrons, and
other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink
tumors. RT may be used as main treatment
to cure cancer (curative treatment), or as
supportive care or palliative care to help
ease pain or discomfort caused by advanced
cancer. Most types of radiation include short
treatment sessions that are given once daily
over a few days to weeks. RT treatment can
cause a narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid
artery, and an RT dose to the carotid artery
can increase your risk for stroke. Ask your
care team which radiation option(s) are best
for your situation, if RT will be combined with
chemotherapy, and what side effects to expect.

Common types of EBRT that may be used to
treat your cancer include the following:




Panoramic dental x-ray is part of a preradiation therapy dental evaluation. It is
needed to check the health of your jaw and
teeth to see if you need any dental work before
starting RT. It is important to tell your dentist
about your head and neck cancer and to have
regular dental cleanings and checkups.





NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Nasopharyngeal Cancer, 2024

Three-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3D-CRT) uses
computer software and CT images to aim
beams that match the shape of the tumor.
Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) uses small beams of
different strengths to match the shape
of the tumor. This limits the amount of
radiation to normal tissue. IMRT is most
commonly used to treat NPC.
Stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) uses high-energy
proton or photon beams to kill or ablate
the tumor. SBRT is very precise, which
reduces the chance of damage to nearby
tissues.
Proton beam therapy (PBT) uses
proton beams to kill or ablate the tumor. It
is used as a second radiation option after
another type of radiation was used before.

Treating nasopharyngeal cancer » Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells
throughout the body, including cancer
cells and some normal cells. Sometimes,
chemotherapies are combined together, or are
combined with a checkpoint inhibitor therapy
or targeted therapy. This is called multiagent
chemotherapy. Chemotherapy might be
followed by radiation therapy or chemoradiation.

Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might
be used alone or with other therapies such as
radiation therapy. Goals of systemic therapy
may be curative or palliative and should be
discussed before starting treatment. The
choice of systemic therapy will be based on
your individual needs. Your wishes about
treatment are important. Make your wishes
known.

Chemoradiation
Treatment that combines chemotherapy with
radiation therapy is called chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy may improve how well radiation
works; that is why they are sometimes used
together. For locally advanced disease,
cisplatin is often the preferred chemotherapy
drug given with radiation therapy (RT).
Chemoradiation is often used to cure your
cancer. Chemoradiation may also be used to
control symptoms caused by a tumor even if a
cure is not possible.

Targeted therapy

Immunotherapy

Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop or inhibit
the action of molecules that help cancer cells
grow and/or survive. If your tumor has certain
mutations, targeted therapy might be used.

Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment
that tries to reactivate the immune system
against tumor cells. Immunotherapy can be
given alone or with other types of treatment.
If your tumor has a high number of mutations,
immunotherapy might be given.
For more information, see NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Immunotherapy Side Effects,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Standard of care is the best-known way
to treat a particular disease based on
past clinical trials. There may be more
than one treatment regimen that is
considered standard of care. Ask your
care team what treatment options are
available and if a clinical trial might be
right for you.

Treating nasopharyngeal cancer » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).





Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.





Radiation therapy
External beam radiation
therapy (EBRT) uses a
machine outside the body to
aim radiation at the tumor(s)
or areas of the body.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Phase I trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.
Phase II trials study how well the drug
or approach works against a specific type
of cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or
approach against a standard treatment. If
the results are good, it may be approved
by the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Treating nasopharyngeal cancer » Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, lab
tests, or general health. These requirements
ensure that participants are alike in specific
ways and that the trial is as safe as possible
for the participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
It depends on the study, your health insurance,
and the state in which you live. In general,
procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered
standard of care will be billed to you or
your insurance, whereas those considered
research are covered by the trial sponsor. Your
treatment team and the research team can
help determine if you are responsible for any
costs.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Treating nasopharyngeal cancer » Supportive care

Supportive care

It is important to tell your care
team about all of your side effects
so they can be managed.

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care given to prevent,
reduce, and relieve suffering, and to improve
quality of life. Supportive care might include
pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual
support, financial aid, or family counseling. Tell
your care team how you are feeling and about
any side effects so they can be managed.
Supportive care, best supportive care, and
palliative care often mean the same thing.

Late effects
Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.
Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment.

Side effects

Survivorship

All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may be
harmful to your health. Others may just be
unpleasant. Treatment can cause several side
effects. Some are very serious.

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. When treatment
leads to remission (or no evidence of disease),
you will need follow-up or survivorship care for
late effects. During survivorship care you will
still have a care team, but it will look different.
Seek out peer support groups, whether online
or in person.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Supportive care resources

Cranial neuropathies

More information on supportive care is
available at: NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Cranial neuropathies are a common symptom
of nasopharyngeal cancer. Cranial neuropathy
affects the nerves in the head and neck
and might cause pain; dizziness (vertigo);
weakness, numbness, or tingling in the face;
or changes in vision, hearing, taste, and
smell. These changes can affect speech,
swallowing, and hearing, making it difficult to
communicate. This might cause distress and
impact your ability to function and complete
certain tasks at home and at work. Your
treatment may not completely reverse these
symptoms. Treatment may also worsen or
cause new cranial neuropathies if your cancer
is located close to a sensitive nerve or brain
structures. Ask your doctor about these risks,
and what can be done to minimize them. You
can also ask to see an occupational therapist
or speech-language pathologist (SLP), who
might be able to help your recovery from these
symptoms.

Difficulty with smell, nose bleeds,
and congestion
Your sense of smell might be affected by the
cancer or its treatment. The lining of your nasal
cavity and sinuses might become inflamed
or irritated causing your nose to feel stuffedup or congested. Your nose might bleed. You
might have headaches. Your care team might
recommend using a humidifier or other ways to
help with sinus or nasal irritation.

Difficulty eating, swallowing, or
speaking
Because of the location of nasopharyngeal
cancer, difficulty eating, swallowing, or
speaking are common side effects of
treatment. Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
or painful swallowing (odynophagia) can be
caused by treatment and might be long term
(chronic). Speech-language pathologists
(SLPs) can help people who have trouble
swallowing or speaking.

Treating nasopharyngeal cancer » Side effects

Distress

eating is important during treatment. It includes
eating a balanced diet, eating the right
amount of food, and drinking enough fluids. A
registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition
and food can help. Weight loss is common in
those with head and neck cancer. You might
be asked to see a nutrition expert before
starting treatment to help prevent severe
weight loss.

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are
common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you are feeling. There are services,
people, and medicines that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Dry mouth

Low blood cell counts

Xerostomia is the medical term for dry mouth.
Treatment to the head or neck can affect
your salivary glands. This means you may
not make as much spit (saliva) as before and
so your mouth may become dry. It is a very
common side effect and might be long term
(chronic). Drinking plenty of water and avoiding
beverages with caffeine, alcohol, or sugar
can help. Special mouth rinses are available.
Continue to see your dentist regularly.

Some cancer treatments can cause low blood
cell counts.




Fatigue


Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infection.
Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Lymphedema
Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph
fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.
It may be caused when part of the lymph
system is damaged or blocked, such as
during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may

management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression devices, and
other means.

Cancer and its treatment can affect your
overall well-being or quality of life (QOL). Head
and neck tumors often impact a person’s ability
to function such as chew, swallow, speak,
and breathe. They can also impact taste,
smell, hearing, how your voice sounds, or
how you look. It is very important that you are
well-prepared and understand how radiation
therapy might cause changes to these
functions and your appearance.

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

Neurocognitive or
neuropsychological effects

quality of life, see NCCN
Guidelines for Patients:

Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration, memory, and thinking.

Neuropathy
Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment. Most of the
time, neuropathy goes away after treatment.

Radiation dermatitis

Organ issues

Radiation dermatitis or radiation burn is a
common side effect of radiation therapy. It
can cause the skin to change color or cause
dry and itchy skin, pain, peeling, blistering, or
swelling. Your health care provider can help
you find the best treatment for radiation burn.

Treatment might cause your kidneys to not
work as well as they should.

Stiff neck
Cancer or its treatment can cause a stiff neck
and shoulders and long-term (chronic) neck
pain. The stress of having cancer can also
cause tightness in the neck, shoulders, jaw,
and head. Movement such as tai chi, walking,
or stretching, and massage might help a stiff
neck and shoulders to feel better. Speak to
your care team about how to manage chronic
neck pain.

Pain
Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a palliative
care specialist or with a pain specialist to
manage pain. Some people may benefit from
palliative radiation therapy to help relieve pain.
During this treatment, a radiation beam is
focused on the tumor or metastasis.

Systemic therapy works throughout the
body. It includes chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and immunotherapy.

Keep a pain diary

Targeted therapy can block the ways
cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the
body.

A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

Immunotherapy uses your body’s natural
defenses to find and destroy cancer cells.
Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, gamma rays,
protons, photons, and other sources to kill
cancer cells and shrink tumors.

Include in your pain diary:

Treatment that combines chemotherapy
with radiation therapy is called
chemoradiation.

Warnings about supplements
and drug interactions

Treatment options for early-stage
cancer are radiation therapy (RT) or
chemoradiation.

You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This
is called a drug interaction.

In locally advanced cancer, cancer has
spread to areas such as the skull and
cancer is in 1 or more lymph nodes.
A clinical trial or chemotherapy followed
by chemoradiation is preferred in locally
advanced cancer.

It is critical to speak with your care team
about any supplements you may be
taking. Some examples include:

After completing treatment, you will have
blood and imaging tests, physical exams,
and doctor appointments to monitor for
any signs of cancer returning. Contact
your doctor right away if you notice any
changes in your head or neck.

Treatment

Follow-up care

Treatment for metastatic disease is based
on if there are a few metastases called
oligometastases or if the cancer is widespread.
Treatment focuses on reducing the number of
metastases or amount of cancer, sometimes
referred to as cancer burden.

General follow-up care includes regular and
frequent doctor visits to check for late effects
and signs that cancer has returned. It is
important to contact your doctor right away if
you notice any changes in your head or neck.
For general follow-up care, see Guide 4.

Oligometastatic disease

Recurrent or persistent
disease

In oligometastases, a few number of cancer
deposits are found outside of the head and
neck region.

Recurrent disease is cancer that has returned
after a disease-free period. Persistent disease
is cancer that remains after treatment. It might
include cancer that has grown or spread during
treatment.

An unresectable tumor cannot be removed
with surgery. Sometimes, an unresectable
tumor can become resectable after treatment.
Treatment options include chemoradiation,
radiation therapy, or systemic therapy.

A resectable tumor can be removed with
surgery. Surgery is not usually done for
nasopharyngeal cancer. This is due to the
location of the nasopharynx inside the body.

Cancer that has spread to distant areas
in the body is called metastatic cancer.
Metastatic cancer can be oligometastatic
or widespread. In oligometastatic disease,
there are a limited number of tumors.

Let us know what
you think!

Recurrent disease is cancer that has
returned after a disease-free period.
Persistent disease is cancer that
remains after treatment. It might include
cancer that has grown or spread during
treatment.

Please take a moment to
complete an online survey
about the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients.

Treatment is based on the size and
location of the tumor(s), if there is cancer
in the lymph nodes, and what treatment
you had before. Your overall health and
preferences about treatment are also
important.

A resectable tumor can be removed
with surgery. An unresectable tumor
cannot be removed with surgery.
Sometimes an unresectable tumor can
become resectable after treatment with
