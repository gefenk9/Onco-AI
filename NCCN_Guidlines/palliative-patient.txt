About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Palliative Care Version 2.2023 – April 24, 2023.

What’s the difference between
palliative care and hospice?

Oncologists specialize in diagnosing
and treating cancer. Types of oncologists
include medical, radiation, and surgical
oncologists.

Hospice care is specifically designed for
individuals with a limited life expectancy. It
focuses on providing comfort and support to
people and their families by providing care
providers and resources that specialize in
end-of-life (EOL) care.

Palliative care specialists specialize
in putting you at the center of your care
and concentrate on preventing and
alleviating suffering and improving quality
of life.
Oncology nurses provide your
hands-on care, like giving systemic
therapy, managing your care, answering
questions, and helping you cope with side
effects.



Oncology pharmacists are experts
in knowing how to use medicines to treat
cancer and to manage symptoms and
side effects.
Radiation therapists provide your
hands-on delivery of radiotherapy
treatments.



Nutritionists and dietitians can
provide guidance on what foods are most
suitable for your condition.
An occupational therapist helps
people with the tasks of daily living.



A physical therapist helps people
move with greater comfort and ease.
A certified lymphedema therapist
gives a type of massage called manual
lymph drainage.

Psychologists and psychiatrists
are mental health experts who can help
manage issues such as depression,
anxiety, or other mental health conditions
that can affect how you think, behave,
and feel.
Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional conditions. They, or other
designated professionals, can help
navigate the complexities of financial and
insurance stresses.

Spiritual care specialists identify
and support those with spiritual distress or
unmet spiritual needs.

About palliative care » Palliative care specialists

Palliative care specialists
Palliative care specialists work as part of
a team that may include doctors, nurses,
social workers, chaplains, and pharmacists.
It may also include registered dieticians,
occupational therapists, physical therapists,
and psychologists. Palliative care specialists
provide an extra layer of support and can be
found in hospitals, outpatient centers, or in the
community.

When is palliative care given?
Palliative care is appropriate for any cancer
stage and any cancer diagnosis.

The palliative care team works together with
you and your other health care providers to
ensure you are at the center of conversations
and decision-making about your cancer care.

Palliative care aims to:

3 Manage symptoms and relieve

suffering in all stages of disease,

Palliative care teams may also be involved in
the care of children and teens, whether they
have cancer or are the children of adults with
cancer. Because of the unique needs in this
group, a palliative care team may include
additional specialists such as those who work
in child life services. Child life services help
children cope with the stress and fear of being
in a hospital.

In constipation, stool (poop) is hard, dry,
and difficult to pass, and bowel movements
don’t happen very often. Other symptoms
may include painful bowel movements, and
feeling bloated, uncomfortable, and sluggish.
Constipation is common in those who are
treated with opioids. Other medicines and
some cancers can cause constipation. In
addition to physical discomfort, constipation
can cause distress and anxiety. Medicine may
be given to prevent or manage constipation.

Physical symptoms
Physical symptoms may be uncomfortable
and distressing. Share with your care team
any concerns you may have. It is important to
voice how you are feeling and any changes
you have noticed so you can get the treatment
you need.

Delirium
Delirium is a mental state in which you are
confused, disoriented, and not able to think or
remember clearly. It is a fast-developing type
of confusion that makes it hard to concentrate
or stay alert. It happens when your brain is
not working as it should for various reasons.
People with delirium often act very differently
from their usual selves.

The following pages discuss general situations
and symptoms that might suggest the need for
palliative care involvement. Pain and difficulty
breathing are common physical symptoms
experienced by those with cancer.

What’s the difference between a
sign and symptom?

The following may help reduce delirium:

A sign can be seen by someone else like your
health care provider (HCP). A symptom is
something only you can feel. It is important to
tell your HCP if something doesn’t feel or look
right. Don’t wait to say something!



You might be asked to describe your
symptoms, their frequency, and how much
they bother (distress) you. Your care team will
try to anticipate symptoms, discuss how to
prevent symptoms, and explain what to

Controlling the environment, which
includes making sure that the room is
quiet, calm, and well-lit; having clocks
or calendars in view; and having family
members around.
Reducing or changing medicines that
might be causing delirium.

Difficulty breathing

If needed, making sure that the person
has a hearing aid, glasses, or other
devices for communication

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
(called dyspnea) is a very common symptom.
How it feels and the level of discomfort
is different for everyone. Non-medicine
therapies are recommended such as the use
of handheld fans directed at the face, cooler
temperatures, stress management, relaxation
therapy, and emotional and psychosocial
support. Depending on the cause or the type of
discomfort, medicine or other treatments might
be given.

Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements, or more bowel movements
than usual. It is a common side effect of
chemotherapy. The severity (grade) and cause
of diarrhea might be rated using a scoring
system. Diarrhea is treated with prescription
and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and
food recommendations (like eating rice or
bread). Avoid taking OTC medicines without
speaking to your care team first. It is possible
for diarrhea medicines to cause constipation
or have other side effects. Ask your care team
how to manage diarrhea and constipation.

Supportive care resources
More information on supportive care is
available at:
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Difficulty eating

Lymphedema

Many with cancer lose the desire to eat
(anorexia) and don’t feel hungry. Treatment
or cancer can cause nausea and vomiting,
mouth sores, food to taste differently, digestion
issues, and pain. Your care team will look at
the rate and severity of weight loss, if there is
difficulty eating or digesting, and what might be
causing the weight loss, among other things.
You might have a swallowing evaluation. If you
are having difficulty with eating, your team may
ask you to meet with a registered dietitian,
who is an expert in nutrition and food. Speak
to your care team if you have trouble eating or
maintaining weight.

Lymphedema is a condition in which extra
lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes
swelling. It may be caused when part of the
lymph system is damaged or blocked, such as
from surgery to remove lymph nodes or from
radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph
vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling
usually develops slowly over time. It may
develop during treatment or it may start years
after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you
may be referred to an expert in lymphedema
management. The swelling may be reduced by
exercise, massage, compression sleeves, and
other means.

Fatigue

For more information, see NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Survivorship Care for CancerRelated Late and Long-Term Effects, available
at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect
of treatment. Let your care team know how
you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the
way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a
balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture,
and massage therapy may help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting can be caused by cancer
or its treatment. There are many medicines
available to prevent nausea and vomiting.
Often, these medicines work very well. One
cause of nausea and vomiting might be a
tumor blocking part of the bowel. Call your
care team if you have nausea and vomiting
that is new or worsening.

For more information, see NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Fatigue and Cancer, available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Managing distressing symptoms » Physical symptoms

Pain
Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional
experience. Pain can be caused by cancer or
cancer treatment. Controlling symptoms and
managing pain is an important part of cancer
care.

You know your body better
than anyone

Pain is a very subjective experience. Everyone
feels pain differently. Some people are very
sensitive to pain. Some people can tolerate
a lot of pain. Either way, you should not
hesitate to contact your care team if you are
experiencing pain. Talking about your pain
is not “complaining” and ensuring your pain
needs are met can improve quality of life.

Help your care team understand:

3 How you feel
3 What you need
3 What is working and what is not

Non-medicine treatments can also help
with the stress and anxiety of having pain.
Examples include massage, art or music
therapy, acupuncture, relaxation, mindfulness
(guided imagery), and cognitive behavior
therapy (CBT). Radiation therapy can
sometimes also help with pain, for example
pain caused by bone metastases.

Keep a list of names and contact
information for each member of your team.
This will make it easier for you and anyone
involved in your care to know whom to
contact with questions or concerns.
Get to know your care team and
help them get to know you.

Sleep and wake issues
Sleep issues are common in those with cancer
and cancer survivors. You might have trouble
falling and staying asleep (insomnia). You
might have difficulty staying awake during
the day (somnolence). Side effects from
cancer or its treatment might interrupt your
sleep. You might have treatable conditions
such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless
legs syndrome, or periodic limb movement
disorder. Your care team might change or
add medicines or recommend a sleep study
depending on your situation. Resting and
getting enough sleep are important. Talk to
your care team if your sleep or wake patterns
has changed.

Wounds

Mental health conditions

A wound is a break in the skin or other body
tissues caused by injury, pressure, infection,
surgery, or cancer. A malignant wound
happens when cancer cells travel from inside
the body to the skin. This damages the skin
and the blood and lymph vessels that support
the skin, causing cell death. There are many
ways to treat wounds based on the type of
wound and its cause. A wound care specialist
might be useful in some cases.

Some conditions that affect how we think, feel,
and act need to be treated by a specialist such
as a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist is a medical
doctor who diagnoses and treats mental,
emotional, and behavioral disorders.

Emotional and spiritual support
Psychologists, social workers, and spiritual
care advisors such as hospital chaplains,
personal clergy, or community representatives
may provide help with easing distress.

Psychosocial and spiritual
distress

Chaplains may be found in hospitals, mental
health facilities, correctional institutions,
children’s hospitals, hospice centers, and
nursing homes. They work with individuals,
couples, families, and small groups, offering
support and encouragement by:

A cancer diagnosis and treatment can
cause psychosocial and spiritual distress.
Psychosocial has to do with mental, emotional,
and social aspects of life. Some of the
psychosocial effects of cancer are changes
in how a person thinks, as well as their
feelings, moods, beliefs, ways of coping,
and relationships with family, friends, and
coworkers.





Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
Distress can include anxiety, depression, and
difficulty sleeping. It can affect the way you
think, feel, or act. Distress is normal during
cancer care, but it may make it harder to cope
with cancer. There are many ways to treat
psychosocial and spiritual distress, such as
counseling, education, group support, and
spiritual support. Ask your care team for more
information.

often customize their approach based on
an individual’s background, age, or medical
condition.

Coping skills are strategies a person uses
to deal with stressful situations. These skills
can be learned, and each person has a

Find a source of spiritual support.

Family, friends, and coworkers can find it
difficult to know how and when to support a

Grief and bereavement



Grief is deep sorrow or sadness caused by
loss, such as the death of a friend or family
member. Grief might also be felt by the person
with cancer. Grief is a normal response to
loss. Hospice and palliative care teams have
expertise in how to provide support during this
period.






Anticipatory grief or anticipatory
mourning is grief experienced by the
person with cancer and their family and
caregivers before death. It includes
feelings of loss, concern for the dying
person, balancing conflicting demands,
and preparing for death.

Grief counseling is used to help
people cope with grief. Many hospice
programs offer grief support, or they can
refer you to another professional for help.

Bereavement care is often best provided by an
experienced hospice team or a skilled mental
health care professional. A well-supported
end-of-life care experience can help with
acceptance and bereavement.

Bereavement is the period of sadness
(grief) experienced by family and
caregivers following a death. There is no
right or wrong way to grieve. The process
takes time.

"Don't let yourself stop doing the
things you enjoy doing. Whatever
your hobbies are, whatever
things you like to do, keep doing
them. It'll help you feel more
like yourself and stay positive
during what is an exhausting and
mentally straining time."

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Palliative Care, 2023

Complicated grief happens when
grief does not progress as expected.
When grief persists over a long period of
time, it is important to seek help from a
qualified professional. Complicated grief
will not go away on its own.

About cancer treatment

Shared decision-making is an
important part of person-centered

Cancer treatment will be based on your
preferences and goals of treatment, and the
features of your tumor, cancer, or cancer
status. Many factors play a role in how the
cancer responds to treatment. It is important to
have regular talks with your care team about
how treatment is working for you, including
how it is impacting your ability to live your life
the way you want.

cancer care, including palliative
care and advance care planning.
In shared decision-making, you
and your care team discuss and
weigh options, and decide on a
care plan that is right for you.

For specific treatment recommendations about
your type of cancer, see the complete list of
NCCN Guidelines for Patients at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Communication is key

What is a prognosis?

Shared decision-making (SDM) is an important
part of person-centered cancer care, including
palliative care and advance care planning.
Together, you and your care team will discuss
and weigh options, and decide on a care plan.
Most people want to be involved in decisions
about their health care. When people are
involved in decisions about their care, they
experience a greater sense of control, higher
satisfaction, and improved quality of life.

When a person and their family first learn of
a cancer diagnosis, they often want to know
what this means for them. A prognosis is a
way that your cancer team tries to answer
the question about what this cancer means
for your care plan, how you'll live your life,
and how long you'll live your life. Prognostic
awareness (PA) is a person’s knowledge and
understanding of the course their life is likely
to take. A prognosis can change in response
to treatment. For example, if a treatment can
control your cancer, you might live longer if you
receive that treatment. Consider if you want
your doctor to talk about your prognosis.

We don’t always know what questions to ask
or how to start the conversation about what
we want from a care plan. This book may give
you some ideas of questions to ask at your
next visit. Some people find it helpful to write
questions down in advance and bring them to
their appointment. It may be helpful to have a
friend or family member attend appointments
with you to take notes or ask their own
questions. It is also okay if you don’t have any
questions.

Communicating with your care team » Advance directives

Advance directives

Shared decision-making and
advance care planning

Advance directives (ADs) are only a part
of the larger care planning conversation.
Advance directives are legal documents in
which you write out ahead of time what types
of medical care you would want if you ever
became unable to speak for yourself. They
include naming a health care agent who would
make decisions if you were unable to tell the
doctors yourself. Most advance directives
include a living will section that allows you
to provide information about your goals and
values that may inform future decision-making,
including at the end of life (EOL). Some
advance directives will ask about preferences
for specific treatments such as breathing
tubes, CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation),
dialysis, or tube feeding. Advance directives do
not expire, but you can change or revoke an
advance directive at any time.

When facing a cancer diagnosis, it may be a
good time to share with family and friends how
you feel about life, your body, and your hopes
and worries. Discussing the future in this way
is called advance care planning. Thinking
about what is important to you can help with
shared decision-making now and in the future.
Help your care team understand what matters
to you and how this influences your views
about cancer treatments and quality of life.
Discuss the benefits and burdens of medicines
or therapies that are recommended and how
they might impact your quality of life in both
positive and negative ways. Include family,
friends, and caregivers in these conversations,
as needed.
It is also important for everyone, especially
if you are receiving medical care, to have a
health care proxy. A health care proxy (also
called the durable power of attorney for
health care or DPAHC) allows you to choose
someone to make medical decisions for you if
you ever became unable to speak for yourself.
When you choose a health care proxy, it is
important to talk to the person you choose
about the things that you do or don't want.

How do I choose a health care
agent or proxy?
Name the person who will make health care
decisions for you (health care proxy, agent,
or surrogate) in the advance directive. This
person may have to make some very tough
decisions. Choose carefully when selecting
your proxy and make sure the proxy feels
comfortable representing you.

If your cancer team and health care proxy
understand what is most important to you, it
can help ensure that you always receive the
care that you would want, even if something
were to happen and you were unable to speak
for yourself.

Think about someone who:


You know and trust



Can separate their own wishes from yours



You know would carry out your wishes



Could be easily reached



Could handle it if other family members
or loved ones wanted you to get treated
differently than you would want

Communicating with your care team » MOLST or POLST » Life-sustaining treatments

Some people choose a second person as an
alternate proxy, in case their first choice cannot
be reached at the time decisions need to be
made.

Sometimes life-sustaining treatments are
temporary to help your medical condition
improve and sometimes they are used for a
longer time. It is helpful to think about what is
most important to you and situations where
life-sustaining treatments may or may not
be within your goals of care. Each person’s
definition of what makes life worth living
is unique and will influence these kinds of
decisions. We may not know what will happen
in the future, but sharing what matters most
with your cancer team, family, and friends will
help to ensure the right care plan for you.

MOLST or POLST
Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment
(MOLST) or Physician Orders for LifeSustaining Treatment (POLST) is a type of
advance directive that you may complete
with your doctor. It is signed by both of you.
These forms are not available in every state
and are often used when someone has a clear
preference, such as to avoid CPR. If MOLST
or POLST isn't available in your state, there
may be another order that your doctor can
write to ensure your wishes are respected.

Hospice and end-of-life care
People who are approaching the end of
life (EOL) often find that cancer-directed
treatments and life-sustaining treatments have
more burdens than benefits. For people with
a life expectancy of 6 months or less who
decide to shift their focus towards comfort at
the end of life, hospice is a service that can
provide a special kind of EOL care. Hospice
care is specifically designed for individuals
with a limited life expectancy. It focuses on
providing comfort and support to people and
their families by providing care providers and
resources that specialize in EOL care. Hospice
care can be at home or at an inpatient center.
It can also include respite care. Respite care
provides short-term relief for caregivers. If you
have questions about hospice, bring them up
with your care team.

Life-sustaining treatments
Life-sustaining or life-prolonging treatments
attempt to extend life and can include the use
of machines. This equipment does the work for
an organ, such as:









A machine to help with breathing
(ventilator)
A machine to help your kidneys (dialysis)
A tube placed into your stomach to
provide food, nutrition, and medicines
(nasogastric or gastrostomy tube)
A tube placed into your vein to provide
fluids and medicines (intravenous, IV
tube)
A tube or mask used to supply oxygen

Shared decision-making (SDM) is
an important part of person-centered
cancer care. When people are involved
in decisions about their care, they
experience a greater sense of control,
higher satisfaction, and improved quality
of life.

Be your own advocate. Talk to
someone who has gone through
the same thing as you. Ask
important questions, even the
ones you are afraid to ask.
You have to protect yourself
and ensure you make the best
decisions for you, and get the
best care for your particular
situation.”

Cancer treatment should be based on
your individual needs, type of cancer, and
your preferences and goals.
Advance care planning (ACP) includes
making decisions now about the care
you would want to receive if you became
unable to speak for yourself. Advance
care planning is for everyone.
Advance directives (ADs) are legal
documents in which you write out ahead
of time what types of medical care you
would want if you ever became unable to
speak for yourself. They include naming a
health care agent.
A health care proxy (also called the
durable power of attorney for health
care or DPAHC) allows you to choose
someone to make medical decisions for
you if you ever became unable to speak
for yourself.
Hospice care is specifically designed for
individuals with a limited life expectancy.
It focuses on providing comfort and
support to people and their families by
providing care providers and resources
that specialize in end-of-life care.

care team. If you take the time to build a
relationship with your care team, it will help
you feel supported when considering options
and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your care team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects






Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups
Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people with
cancer, check out the websites listed in this
book.

Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life and length of life
How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Questions to ask

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Palliative Care, 2023

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.

Possible questions to ask your care team are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own.
