About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Melanoma: Cutaneous, Version 2.2024 – April 3, 2024.

Skin basics

Melanoma is a serious form of
skin cancer. But it is curable,

Your skin is the largest organ of your body. It
covers about 20 square feet. Skin protects you
from invaders (such as bacteria, fungi, and
viruses), helps control body temperature, and
allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold.

especially if caught early.
While there is no clear cause of
melanoma, there are several risk
factors described ahead. This

with your doctor. First, it’s
important to know what exactly



melanoma is and where it starts.

Melanoma in the skin
Melanoma is the most
serious type of skin
cancer. Regularly look for
new, changing, or unusual
spots on both exposed
and non-exposed skin.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

Epidermis – The outermost layer of skin
provides a waterproof barrier and creates
skin color.
Dermis – This layer contains tough
connective tissue, blood vessels, hair
follicles, and sweat glands.
Hypodermis – This deep skin tissue is
made of subcutaneous fat, connective
tissue, and lymph vessels.

1 Melanoma basics » Melanin » Melanoma

Melanin
Most melanomas are found in
the early stages when they’re
easier to treat.

Melanin is the pigment (chemical) in skin that
gives it color. In addition, melanin also protects
skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from
the sun. Melanin is produced in cells called
melanocytes. Melanocytes are mainly located
in the skin at the base of the epidermis. They
also determine the color in both your eyes and
hair. Melanocytes are found in other areas of
the body, but the focus of this book is cancer of
skin melanocytes, called melanoma.

Diagnosing and treating melanoma early can
help ensure more positive outcomes. Also
encouraging is that more treatments have
become available for melanoma that has
spread, especially in the past decade.

Melanin levels are typically determined by your
skin type and genetics (genes passed down
from your parents). However, other factors
affect melanin creation. They include:


Important to note: While melanoma often
occurs in people over 50 years of age, it can
occur in people of younger age — even in
children.

UV radiation exposure (from the sun or a
tanning device)



Hormones



Age



Skin pigment disorders

Causes
It is unclear how damage to cells leads to
melanoma, but your genes, your health, and
environmental risk factors can all contribute.

Melanoma

The clearest link is between exposure to UV
radiation from the sun or tanning devices.
Exposure to UV radiation causes changes to
the DNA (genetic material) of pigment cells
and increases the risk of melanoma, especially
in people with lighter skin tones. It is important
to note that UV radiation does not cause all
melanomas. Some melanomas can occur in
areas of your body that are not often exposed
to sunlight.

Melanoma is one of the most serious types
of skin cancer because it spreads beyond the
skin more often than many other skin cancers.
However, if discovered early, it is curable with
the right treatment. Most melanomas (77%) are
found in the early stages — before they have
spread — and when they're easier to treat.
Melanoma occurs when something goes
wrong in your melanocytes (the pigment cells
that produce melanin). When skin cells are
damaged, new cells may grow out of control
and can form a mass of cancerous cells.

1 Melanoma basics » Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms

(usually pink or light brown in color), called
amelanotic melanoma.

Melanoma can be found anywhere on your
body. Most often, it is found in areas of high
intensity sun exposure such as the trunk, legs,
arms, and head.

When you or your health care provider
examine your skin, attention should be paid to
the following:

Sometimes, melanoma can be found in areas
that get little or no sun exposure, such as the
soles of your feet, palms of your hands, and
underneath your fingernails or toenails (called
acral melanomas).






People with darker skin are more likely to
develop melanoma in areas that are less
exposed to the sun. Melanoma can also occur
on internal mucosal surfaces such as in the
mouth, on the tongue, or in the intestines
(mucosal melanoma); in the genital areas; and
in the eyes (ocular or uveal melanoma).
Although rare, melanoma can also show as
a bump or a nodule that lacks dark pigment

Asymmetry – One half of a mole or spot
does not match the other half.
Border – The edges of a spot seem
irregular and are difficult to define.
Color – The color of the spot is not the
same throughout (may be brown, black,
or sometimes with patches of pink, red,
white, or blue).
Diameter – The spot is larger than 6
millimeters (mm) across (about the size of
a pencil eraser).
Evolving – The spot or mole changes its
size, shape, or color.

Early detection of
melanoma: ABCDE rule
For skin self-exams, always
follow the ABCDE rule to
detect unusual moles.

1 Melanoma basics » Risk factors

Risk factors



The exact cause of melanoma is unknown.
But there are many risk factors. A risk factor
is anything that increases your chance of
developing a disease. Some risk factors are
passed down through genes (from parent to
child). Others are associated with activities that
people do.



Having one or more risk factors does not mean
you will develop melanoma.



Genetic physical factors
Certain genetic physical factors can increase
a person’s chances of developing skin cancer.
They include:


A tendency to sunburn — if you
tend to sunburn easily or have a history
of chronic sunburns, especially if you
develop redness and blistering, you have
a higher risk of developing melanoma
Many or unusual moles — if you
have more than 50 moles on your body,
or larger moles that are of unusual sizes
or shapes, this increases your risk of
melanoma

Environmental factors
People often think tan, glowing skin is a sign of
good health. However, too much sun actually
speeds up the effects of aging and increases
your risk of developing skin cancer.

Lighter skin — less melanin (pigment)
in your skin means less protection from
UV radiation, which makes you more
likely to develop melanoma

Pay attention to moles
More than 50 moles on your
body or an unusual type of
mole increases the risk of
melanoma.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

Lighter hair and eyes — you are also
more likely to develop melanoma if you
have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes,
and freckles

9

1 Melanoma basics » Risk factors

The main cause of skin cancer is too much
exposure to UV radiation that comes from:


Excessive time spent tanning in the sun



Using tanning devices



Living in a sunnier climate



Working outdoors







Personal history factors
There are medical and personal history factors
that may cause people to develop melanoma,
including:


Multiple or blistering sunburns – if
you have a history of severe sunburns
and developing blisters after being
exposed to the sun



While a diagnosis of melanoma
can be scary, many advances in
treatment have been made in the
past decade.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

10

Previous skin cancers – if you have
had conditions such as actinic keratosis,
or other skin cancers (such as basal cell
or squamous cell skin cancer)
Childhood cancers – if you had cancer
as a child, this could increase your risk of
developing melanoma as you get older
Weakened or suppressed immune
systems – people with a weakened
immune system or who take medicine
that suppresses immune function are at
higher risk of developing melanoma. This
includes people who have had an organ
transplant or who have HIV or AIDS
Rare inherited conditions – if you
have a skin condition such as xeroderma
pigmentosum, or certain hereditary breast
and ovarian syndromes, this can increase
your risk of developing melanoma

1 Melanoma basics » Key points

Family history factors



Melanoma can run in families. About 1 in 10
people (10%) with melanoma have a family
history of melanoma. Some families get
melanoma because they share the same
skin type or history of sun exposure. Other
families share genes that put them at risk for
melanoma.



Genes are the instructions in cells for making
new cells and controlling how cells behave. An
abnormal change in these instructions, called
gene mutations, can cause cells to grow and
divide out of control. Gene mutations could
lead to genetic conditions like cancer.












Skin (cutaneous) melanoma, especially
among multiple blood relatives, or eye
(uveal) melanoma



Pancreatic, kidney, or breast cancer



Astrocytoma (cancer of the brain or spinal
cord)


Mesothelioma (cancer of the tissue that
covers internal organs)

There are several abnormal (mutated) genes
related to hereditary melanoma. They include:




A CDKN2A mutation, which is the most
common gene mutation. It is also called
p16INK4A or MTS1. It often means that
many cases of melanoma that were found
at an early age run in your family.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

BAP1 gene mutations, which can
cause uveal and, less often, cutaneous
melanoma.

Key points

Hereditary melanoma is sometimes called
familial melanoma. Inherited genes that
increase melanoma risk may also increase the
risk of other cancers. You may have hereditary
melanoma if you have a family history of:


The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R)
gene, which helps determine your skin’s
color. MC1R can determine if you or your
family members have red hair and/or
light skin, which increases your risk for
developing melanoma.

11

Your skin is the largest organ of your
body.
Skin protects you from invaders, helps
control body temperature, and allows for
the sensations of touch, heat, and cold.
Melanin is the pigment (chemical) in skin
that gives it color and protects it from
harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.
Melanoma is a serious form of skin
cancer, but it is curable if found early.
The main cause of skin cancer is
exposure to UV radiation from the sun
and tanning devices.
Genetic physical factors that can increase
the chances of developing skin cancer
include having lighter skin, a tendency to
sunburn, and many moles.
Your medical history may play a role
in developing melanoma, including
frequent sunburns, blistering, previous
skin cancers, and a weakened immune
system.

all diseases, including melanoma. They also
help your care team assess the extent of the
melanoma, which is called the cancer stage.

Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Your medical history will help determine
which treatment is best for you.

Family history
Your doctor will ask about the health history of
family members who are blood relatives. This
information is called a family history. Some
cancers and other diseases can run in families.
Ask family members about their health issues
like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and
at what age they were diagnosed.

Be prepared to list any illnesses or injuries

feel a small prick and a little stinging sensation
as the medicine is injected, but you should not
feel any pain during the biopsy.
You may also want to ask how the biopsy
incision will be closed. Usually it will be closed
with stitches. Any biopsy is likely to leave at
least a small scar. Different methods can result
in different types of scars. You can ask your
doctor about the incision and the potential for
scarring before you have the biopsy.

Lesions
Your doctor will examine your skin for lesions.
A skin lesion is defined as a change in skin
color or texture. Skin lesions can appear
anywhere on your body. Your doctor may
use the ugly duckling or the ABCDE rule
(mentioned in Chapter 1 of this book) to
thoroughly review any marks or lesions on
your skin. When melanoma is diagnosed, it
is considered a cancerous tumor and will be
referred that way throughout this book.

There are several ways to do a skin biopsy.
The doctor will choose one based on the size
of the affected area, where it is on your body,
and other factors.
For the biopsy, all of your lesion or a sample
of it will be removed and tested to confirm
melanoma under the microscope.

Skin color
Your skin color is mainly based on the amount
of melanin in your skin. You know your skin
better than anyone. Tell your doctor about
your normal skin color. Show your doctor any
changes or differences where your skin might
look abnormal or different to you.

A skin lesion biopsy can be incisional (does
not completely remove the lesion) or excisional
(completely removes the lesion).
An excisional or complete biopsy is preferred
for finding melanoma because it removes a
larger area of skin than an incisional or partial
biopsy. It can be done through an elliptical (full
thickness) removal method, a punch method,
or a deep shave removal method (also called a
saucerization biopsy).

Biopsy tests
If you are found to have a lesion of concern
on the skin, part or all of it will be removed
and sent to a lab to be looked at under a
microscope. This is called a skin biopsy. A
biopsy is needed to diagnose melanoma.

Elliptical biopsy
An elliptical excisional biopsy removes an
area of skin usually in the shape of a fusiform
(an oval football shape). A rim of normallooking tissue that surrounds the lesion will be
removed, too. This normal-looking tissue is
called the margin. This method uses stitches.

Skin biopsy types
Skin biopsies are done using a local anesthetic
(numbing medicine), which is injected into the
area with a very small needle. You will likely

2 Testing for melanoma » Biopsy tests

Punch biopsy

Deeper shave biopsies are used for most
melanoma diagnoses to completely remove
the suspicious skin lesion. This biopsy is also
called a scoop biopsy or saucerization/shave
removal. This type of biopsy removes the
top layer of skin (epidermis) and part of the
underlying layer (dermis) using a tool similar to
a razor.

For a punch biopsy (also known as skin punch
biopsy), a small piece of skin and underlying
connective tissue are removed using a hand­
held tool. A few stitches are then used to close
the opening in the skin. One or more punch
biopsies may be used on very large lesions,
where a complete/excisional biopsy isn’t
possible. This can help to avoid inaccurate
pathology results.

Lymph node biopsy
A lymph node might be biopsied if your doctor
suspects it has cancer cells. Lymph nodes are
usually too small to be seen or felt.

Deep shave (saucerization) biopsy
A shave biopsy can be done either on the skin
surface (superficial) or deeper. Superficial
shave biopsies (also called broad or shallow
biopsies) can be used when a lesion is
likely not cancerous. They are generally not
recommended when melanoma is suspected
but may be useful for certain melanoma types
(mainly, lentigo maligna) that are flat skin
lesions.

Lymph nodes may be cancerous if they
feel swollen, enlarged, hard to the touch, or
don’t move when pushed (they are fixed or
immobile). A lymph node biopsy can be done
using a needle or as a small surgery to remove
a lymph node.

Skin punch biopsy
A small piece of skin and
connective tissue are removed
using a hand-held tool.

millimeter (mm) to provide the most helpful
information.

Your biopsy sample should be reviewed by
a pathologist, who is an expert in diagnosing
melanocytic (skin) tumors, or preferably
by a dermatopathologist, who is an expert
in diagnosing skin disorders including
melanoma. This review is called a histology
or histopathology review. The pathologist will
note the overall appearance and the size,
shape, and type of your cells. You will be given
a stage based on this information and other
factors. See the next chapter for more details
on staging.

The more the cells are dividing (higher
mitotic count), the more likely they will invade
the blood or lymph vessels and spread
(metastasize) to other sites of the body.

Margin status (deep and
peripheral)
The edge or border of the tissue removed in
cancer surgery is called the margin. Margin
status of a biopsy or excision specimen refers
to whether the tumor is present at the deep or
peripheral (lateral) margin.

Breslow thickness
The Breslow thickness or depth is used to
measure in millimeters (mm) how far the
melanoma has gone into the deeper layers of
the skin (dermis). This is a good predictor of
how far melanoma has advanced and is used
to determine treatment.

The margin is described as negative or clean
when the pathologist finds no cancer cells at
the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of
the cancer has been removed.
The extent of the final surgical margin depends
on how deep the melanoma is (the Breslow
thickness). A wider excision of the melanoma
is typically done after the initial biopsy.

Ulceration status
Ulceration refers to a breakdown of skin on top
of melanoma, like an open sore. An ulcerated
melanoma is considered more serious
because it has a greater risk of spreading.

Expect your doctor to remove the melanoma
as well as a small amount of normal-looking
skin around it. This margin helps to increase
the chance that all cancerous cells will be
removed. Speak to your doctor about how
much area around the tumor will be removed.
They may draw it on your skin with a marker.

Dermal mitotic rate
The dermal mitotic rate or mitotic rate (MR)
is a measure of how many cancer cells are
growing and dividing in the dermis. The
MR is measured by looking at the excised
(surgically removed) tumor with a microscope.
The number of cells that show mitosis (cells
dividing) are counted. The mitotic rate should
be measured as a specific number per square

Microsatellitosis (present or
absent)
Melanoma may metastasize (spread or travel)
through your lymphatic system to the skin,
subcutaneous (under the skin) tissues, and
lymph nodes.

17

2 Testing for melanoma » Biopsy results

Lymphovascular or angiolymphatic
invasion

Microsatellitosis (having microsatellite tumors)
refers to tiny tumor deposits that have spread
to lymph vessels in the skin near the first
melanoma tumor and can only be seen with a
microscope.

Lymphovascular or angiolymphatic invasion
refers to melanoma that has grown into
(invaded) lymph vessels or blood vessels and
is more aggressive (more likely to spread).

Satellite tumors are found within 2 centimeters
(cm) from the melanoma site or scar and show
as a nodule or bump that can be seen or felt.
Any bumps beyond 2 cm from the melanoma
are referred to as in-transit metastases.

Neurotropism/perineural invasion
Neurotropism or perineural invasion refers to
melanoma growing around nerves in the skin
or within nerves (called intraneural invasion). It
is most often seen in desmoplastic melanoma
and has a higher tendency to recur on the skin
or nearby.

Pure desmoplasia (if present)
Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a rare type
of melanoma that is found most often on the
head, neck, and shoulders. It occurs in 1 out
of 25 people (4%) with melanoma. It is divided
into two categories: pure and mixed. Pure
desmoplasia may be associated with a higher
risk of local recurrence on the skin but has a
lower risk of lymph node involvement.

For a list of what factors will be considered
when pathologists analyze biopsies, see

Guide 3.

Your pathologist might also use
immunostaining to help make a more accurate

will usually be given orally (by mouth) or
intravenously (injected with a needle through
the vein), which is called an IV contrast.

Imaging (radiology) tests

Most scans will be performed with IV contrast
unless it is unsafe for you. This means it
could cause a bad reaction if you have
certain allergies or conditions or take certain
medications. It is important to tell your doctors
if you have had an allergic reaction to contrast
in the past.

Imaging tests take pictures (images) of the
inside of your body. These tests are sometimes
used for cancer staging or to check symptoms.
However, not everyone with melanoma needs
imaging. A radiologist, an expert in interpreting
test images, will write a report and send this
report to your doctor. Your test results will be
discussed with you.

The general types of imaging tests include:

CT scan

For most of these testing scans, contrast
materials will be used. Contrast materials are
substances that help certain areas in the body
stand out. They are used to make the pictures
clearer. Contrast materials are not permanent
and will leave the body in your urine. They

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one big picture.

CT machine
A CT machine is large and
has a tunnel in the middle.
During the test, you will lie
on a table that moves slowly

not use x-rays.

Biomarkers are specific features of cancer
cells. Biomarkers can include proteins made
in response to cancer and/or reflect changes
(mutations) in the DNA of cancer cells. A
mutation might cause a gene to create a
protein and keep making it. This means certain
cells get ongoing signals to keep dividing and
no instructions on when to stop. This can lead
to the development of a tumor.

PET-CT scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer
is injected into a vein (through an IV using a
needle). The needle is most often inserted on
the inside of your elbow.

Testing on biomarkers involves studying a
piece of tumor tissue in a laboratory or testing
a blood sample (also called a liquid biopsy).
Other names for biomarker testing include
molecular testing, tumor profiling, genomic
testing, tumor gene testing, next-generation
sequencing, and mutation testing.

The tracer travels through your blood and
collects in organs and tissues. This helps the
radiologist see certain areas more clearly. You
may need to wait for the tracer to be absorbed
by your body, which takes about 1 hour.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a common
and quick lab test of biomarkers that involves
adding a chemical marker to immune cells.
The cells are then studied under a microscope.
IHC might be used to see if cancer has spread,
or to look for mutations such as BRAF, KIT, or
NRAS, or PD-L1 proteins. It may also be used
to help tell the difference between different
types of cancer.

The tracer is attached to a substance that
your cells and tissues use for energy or food.
Cancer cells use more of this substance than
non-cancer cells.
The radioactive part of the tracer lets your
care team see how your cells are using the
substance. This helps them find any usage
that is not normal.

Biomarker testing is used to learn whether
the cancer has any targetable changes to
help guide your treatment. The results of
the biomarker testing can also be used to
determine whether you meet criteria for joining
certain clinical trials.

Cancer cells show up as bright spots on
PET scans. Not all bright spots are cancer.
It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and
bladder to be bright on a PET scan since they
require a lot of food or energy. When a PET
scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/
CT scan, and they are almost always used
together.

BRAF mutations
BRAF is a human gene that encodes a protein
called B-Raf. The B-Raf protein helps control
cell growth. If a person has a mutation in their
BRAF gene, it can cause a melanoma to grow
20

2 Testing for melanoma » Blood tests

BRAF gene mutation from continuing to grow
the cancer.

Biomarker testing is usually
done in advanced stages (stage
3 and stage 4) of melanoma. But
not everyone with melanoma in
those stages will need this type
of testing.

If IHC detects a BRAF V600E mutation,
targeted therapy or immunotherapy may be a
treatment option, if needed.
If IHC does not detect a BRAF V600E
mutation, a more specialized test like
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next
generation sequencing (NGS) may be used.
These tests may also detect other mutations
like BRAF V600K, NRAS, and KIT.

Uses for biomarker testing
Biomarker or molecular testing can be
used in the following instances:

•

To help diagnose your cancer

•

To help determine your prognosis or
see how advanced your cancer is,
especially the risk of metastasis (how
likely it is to spread)

•

To find genetic mutations that happen
after birth that can be treated with
a targeted therapy or an immune
therapy

•

To help you and your care team with
treatment planning

Blood tests
Blood tests check for signs of disease and how
well organs are working. They use a sample of
your blood, which is removed through a needle
placed into your vein.
Blood tests are not used to diagnose
melanoma or monitor early melanomas.
However, they may be done before or during
treatment, especially for more advanced
melanomas.
Tests that may be requested include:
Lactate dehydrogenase – Lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is a protein found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into blood. A
high LDH level is a sign that the melanoma
may have spread to other parts of the body
and may be harder to treat. This blood test
may be done if your care provider suspects the
cancer has spread to distant sites (called stage
4 or metastatic cancer).

in at least half of people who have melanoma
in the skin.
It is helpful if the BRAF gene mutation is found
before treatment of advanced disease. Doctors
can use targeted therapy to inhibit (stop) the

2 Testing for melanoma » Understanding test results

Other blood tests – Other blood tests are
not regularly done before starting treatment.
But they may be done to plan surgical
treatment. These tests are done, if you have
advanced melanoma, to define whether
the bone marrow, liver, and kidneys are
working before and during treatment. This
may include a complete blood count (CBC)
or comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). A
CMP measures your sugar (glucose) level,
electrolyte and fluid balance, kidney function,
and liver function.

Positive vs. Negative Results
The truth of what they mean
It might seem confusing and the opposite
of what you’d think at first. But it’s
important to know that when you hear of a
positive result in cancer testing, it means
that the cancer was found. When you
hear of a negative result, that means the
cancer was not found.

Understanding test results
The results of your physical exam, skin biopsy,
and possible imaging studies will determine
your treatment plan. It’s important you
understand what these tests mean.



Keep these things in mind:







Bring someone with you to your
appointments, if possible.
Write down questions before your
appointments and take notes during clinic
visits. Don’t be afraid to ask your care
team questions. Get to know your care
team and let them get to know you.
Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

22

Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer if you have one.
Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your smartphone if you have one.
Hang the list on your refrigerator or in
an obvious place where someone can
access it in an emergency.

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in
your life including other cancers.
A head-to-toe skin exam should include a
review of the scalp, face, mouth, hands,
feet, torso and extremities, eyes and
eyelids, ears, fingers, toes, and toenails.
This includes examining your skin for
lesions.
A melanoma diagnosis is primarily based
on the results of a skin biopsy. If you have
a suspicious lesion, it will be removed and
sent to a lab to be examined.
Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body, which are examined to look
for cancer. Not everyone with melanoma
needs imaging tests.
Biomarker or molecular tests look
for certain genes, proteins, or other
molecules in a sample of tissue, blood,
or other bodily fluid. These tests are
sometimes used to help diagnose
melanoma, and to stage and treat it.
Blood tests may be done if you have
surgery, if your care provider suspects the
cancer has spread, or if you are taking
systemic treatment for melanoma.

The higher the stage, the thicker the tumor or
the more the cancer has spread. An example
of this is T1a, N0, M0, which indicates a stage
1A melanoma.






The thickness of a melanoma
tumor is measured in
millimeters (mm). The tip of a
pencil is about 1 mm thick.

Tumor depth (T) – refers to the
thickness of the primary tumor and
whether the tumor has broken through
the skin like an open sore (this is
called ulceration). This is measured in
millimeters (mm).

T1a – less than 0.8 mm without
ulceration
• T1b – less than 0.8 mm with ulceration
or between 0.8 and 1 mm with or without
ulceration
•

Lymph node status (N) – refers to
whether the cancer has spread nearby
(regionally) through small tubes called
lymph vessels or to small bean-shaped
structures (in the neck, armpits, or groin)
called lymph nodes.

T2 – the tumor is between 1 mm and 2 mm
with unknown or unspecified ulceration

Metastasis (M) – describes whether the
cancer has spread to parts of the body far
away from the primary tumor, like internal
organs and distant lymph nodes.

T2a – between 1 mm and 2 mm without
ulceration
• T2b – between 1 mm and 2 mm with
ulceration
•

See Guide 1 and Guide 2 for a

breakdown of the 5 stages of melanoma.

T3 – the tumor is between 2 mm and 4 mm

of melanoma that help determine its stage.

T3a – between 2 mm and 4 mm without
ulceration
• T3b – between 2 mm and 4 mm with

Tumor depth (T)
The tumor part of staging describes the
characteristics of the original melanoma in
thickness and ulceration. The following is a
breakdown of what each type of T means.

T4 –the tumor is greater than 4 mm

T4a – greater than 4 mm without
ulceration
• T4b – greater than 4 mm with ulceration

Breslow thickness: What is it?
In your pathology report, you might see
Breslow depth or thickness mentioned.
This is the measurement in millimeters
(mm) of how deep or thick the melanoma
tumor is.

N0 – there are no regional metastases (in
lymph nodes) detected
N1 – involves one tumor-involved node
or in-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite
metastases with no tumor-involved nodes

•

N1a – one node detected by sentinel
lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
• N1b – one node clinically detected (felt
during physical examination)
• N1c – no regional lymph node disease
•

Metastasis (M)
The metastasis part of staging describes
whether the cancer has spread to a distant
part of the body, which tends to be lungs, liver,
bones, brain, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
There are only two descriptors for metastasis:
either the cancer has spread to distant areas
or it has not.

N2 – means 2 or 3 tumor-involved nodes
or in-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite
metastases with one tumor-involved node

N2a – 2 or 3 detected by SLNB
• N2b – 2 or 3 nodes, at least one of which
was clinically detected
• N2c – 2 nodes found by SLNB or
clinically detected
•

M0 – no evidence of distant metastasis
M1 – evidence of distant metastasis

N3 – means 4 or more tumor-involved nodes
or in-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite
metastases with 2 or more tumor involved
nodes, or any number of matted nodes without
or with in-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite
metastases

N3a – 4 or more tumors detected by

Because it might be challenging at first glance
to follow the clinical and pathological stages,
they are described in more detail in the stagespecific chapters.

In general, stage 0, stage 1, and stage
2 melanoma are early cancers in the skin
that are not known to have spread elsewhere.
Stage 0 through stage 2 are almost the same
in the clinical and pathological stages. For
more detailed information on early stage
melanoma, see Chapter 5: Treatment for
stages 0 to 2.

Stage 3 melanoma has spread but is
considered regional. Once the tumor is
considered stage 3, it involves the lymph
nodes and lymphatic vessels and after surgery,
it is broken down into four pathological
stages (3A, 3B, 3C, 3D). For more detailed
information on stage 3 melanoma, see Chapter
6: Treatment for stage 3.

Care team
After being diagnosed, knowing what to do
next can be overwhelming and confusing. But
you have a care team to help. Aside from your
primary care provider (such as your family
doctor), there are several medical professionals
who will help you make decisions about your
treatment and supportive care.

Head and neck surgeons are doctors
who treat diseases (both cancerous and
noncancerous) of the head and neck.

Other health professionals
Oncology nurses are nurses who provide
hands-on care, like giving systemic therapy,
managing your care plan, answering
questions, and helping you cope with side
effects. Sometimes these experts are called
nurse navigators.

Depending on your diagnosis, your treatment
team might include the following specialists.

Doctors who treat cancer
Dermatologists are doctors who diagnose
and treat skin conditions, including skin cancer.
They can also do skin exams and help you
learn how to do them on your own. Some
dermatologists do surgery.

Pharmacists are medical professionals who
are trained to prepare and give out medicine
and teach about their proper use and any side
effects. Some pharmacists specifically work
with people with cancer.

to children through genes. They are trained
to diagnose and treat genetic disorders and
counsel people and families at risk.

Order of Treatments
Most people with melanoma will receive
more than one type of treatment. This is
an overview of the order of treatments
and what they do.

Nutritionists and dietitians are
professionals who help guide you on what
foods are most suitable for your diagnosis and
treatment.

Neoadjuvant (before) treatment is
given to shrink the tumor before primary
treatment (surgery). This might make
surgery possible for some challenging
melanoma tumors.

Palliative care nurses are professionals
who help provide an extra layer of support with
your cancer-related symptoms.
Psychologists and psychiatrists are
mental health experts who can help you
manage issues such as depression, anxiety,
or other conditions that can affect how you feel
during treatment.

Primary treatment is the main treatment
given to rid the body of cancer. Surgery
is usually the main treatment when the
tumor can be removed, often in early
stage melanoma.

Social workers are advocates who help
people solve and cope with problems in their
everyday lives while they have treatment.

Adjuvant (after) treatment is given after
primary treatment to rid the body of any
cancer cells left behind from surgery.
It is also used when the risk of cancer
returning (recurrence) is felt to be high.

Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout your treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it.

in centimeters (cm). The size to be removed
depends on the thickness of the primary tumor

(see Guide 4).

Surgery is an operation or procedure to
remove cancer from the body. The type of
surgery depends on the size, number, and
location of the cancer. Surgery is the primary
(first) treatment for almost all melanomas.

A wide excision may be done in a doctor's
office or in the hospital (operating room).
You may receive local anesthesia before the
surgery. Local anesthesia is a medicine that
numbs a small area of the body to minimize
pain during the surgery. Most stage 0 and
stage 1 melanomas are treated under local
anesthesia.

A person diagnosed with melanoma should
expect some surgery to follow the skin biopsy.
The goal of surgery for a primary melanoma
tumor is to remove all the cancer from your
body. For melanomas that have a low risk of
spread, surgery may be the only treatment
needed. There are different types of surgery
used for melanoma.

For deeper or more advanced melanomas that
require lymph node biopsy (described below)
or more extensive surgery, general anesthesia
may be used. While you are fully asleep, you
will inhale the anesthesia through a breathing
tube.

Wide excision
A wide excision surgery removes the
melanoma tumor as well as some normallooking tissue surrounding it (the surgical
margin). The surgical margin is measured

A wide excision is done even if the melanoma
tumor was removed by biopsy. A wide excision
will also remove lymph vessels in the skin

because there could be additional tumor cells
and any nearby microsatellites. Lymph vessels
are thin-walled and tube-like — similar to blood
vessels — that carry a fluid called lymph.
Microsatellites are tiny tumor deposits that
have spread to lymph vessels in the skin near
the first melanoma tumor and can only be seen
with a microscope.

Following the surgery, a skin graft might be
recommended to cover the wound. Skin
grafting involves removing skin from one area
of the body and moving it to a different area.
Skin grafts are surgeries that can be
performed in the clinic or hospital. Most larger
skin grafts involve sedation (giving medicine
to help relax you) or general anesthesia,
which means you’ll be asleep throughout the
procedure and won’t feel any pain.

A wide excision is often cut as an ellipse
(football shape) to allow the wound to heal as a
flat line. The surgical margin will be cut based
on the thickness of the melanoma tumor.

Sometimes, rotational “flaps” of tissue may
be used to plan for wound closure so you
can avoid a skin graft. A skin flap is a type
of wound closure that takes skin from an
area close to a wound and layers it to fill the
removal of a skin lesion. Talk to your doctor
about your options and how you can expect to
heal after wide excision surgery.

Side effects of wide excision
Side effects of wide excision surgery may
include pain, swelling, numbness and/
or scarring. Pain and swelling are usually
temporary and should only last for a few
weeks after surgery. Scars can be a lasting
result of surgery. Talk to your doctor if you are
concerned about scars due to the surgery.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy

To locate the sentinel lymph node(s), your
surgeon or the radiology team will inject a
radioactive substance (and in some cases,
a blue-colored dye) into your skin near the
tumor. The substance will drain into the
sentinel lymph nodes. Your surgeon will
identify the sentinel lymph nodes using a
device and remove them through a small cut
in your skin. This procedure is generally done
under general anesthesia.

A sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node
where cancer cells most likely spread from a
primary tumor. Sometimes there is more than
one sentinel lymph node.
A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a
surgery that removes a lymph node to examine
if any cancer cells have spread to the local
lymph nodes. These nodes will be checked for
cancer cells by a pathologist in a lab. Many
people with melanoma have an SLNB at the
same time as the wide excision.

Side effects of SLNB
You could experience some side effects after an
SLNB, including numbness, pain, or bruising.
You could also develop a seroma, which is a
collection of fluid in the lymph node basin. The
lymph node basin is the group of lymph nodes
where lymph from the tumor area drains.

The results will be used to stage the cancer
and plan treatment.

Lymph nodes
There are hundreds of small bean-shaped
structures throughout the human body
called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes catch
and filter out foreign particles and harmful
cells, including cancer cells.

most serious side effect of lymph node surgery
because it causes swelling and discomfort in
body parts, most commonly in the arms or legs
and is treated with compression therapy and/or
physical therapy.

Your doctor or care team should discuss with
you the possible risks and benefits of an SLNB
before you have the surgery.

More information about managing
lymphedema can be found in NCCN

cancer has spread to the lymph node basin.
This is not often done if there is cancer only in
sentinel lymph nodes. A lymph node dissection
removes nodes to prevent disease from
coming back or spreading elsewhere. This
surgery is done under general anesthesia.
Lymph node dissection is generally reserved
for advanced melanomas with nearby enlarged
lymph nodes. Or it's done for nodes that have
grown over time and are shown to contain
melanoma.

From the time of diagnosis,
ask your doctor about
participating in a clinical trial
of a melanoma treatment.
Clinical trials can be an option
at any stage of disease.

Completion lymph node dissection refers
to a dissection done after tiny amounts of
cancer are found in the SLNB. It is not often
performed after SLNB for most patients, and
nodal ultrasound or other imaging tools can
be used instead to monitor the lymph nodes.
Newer systemic therapy options are lessening
the need for this type of surgery for SLNBpositive stage 3 melanoma.
However, for more extensive node disease
found on exam or on imaging, full therapeutic
lymph node dissection is still the most common
approach. But it may be combined with
systemic drug therapy before or after surgery.
Common side effects of this surgery include
pain, numbness, limited movement (of arms or

4 Treatment overview » Targeted therapy

Targeted therapy



Targeted therapy drugs are designed to
specifically target cancer cells. For melanoma,
these drugs target the activity of a specific or
unique feature of melanoma cells and interfere
with how those cancer cells grow.

In most cases, BRAF inhibitors and MEK
inhibitors are combined to treat melanomas
that have mutations in the BRAF genes, such
as these combinations:

Cancer growth inhibitors
Cancer growth inhibitors (or blockers) are
a type of drug that stops cancer cells from
growing. Our bodies make chemicals called
growth factors that control cell growth.





Cancer growth blockers work by blocking
the growth factors that trigger cancer cells to
divide and grow. They are often taken orally
(by mouth) and can be taken at home.



There are several types of cancer growth
inhibitors, including:




Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and trametinib
(Mekinist)
Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and cobimetinib
(Cotellic)
Encorafenib (Braftovi) and binimetinib
(Mektovi)

BRAF and MEK inhibitors can cause nonmelanoma skin cell cancers, photosensitivity,
other skin reactions, and many possible
systemic side effects, including rash, nausea,
diarrhea, loss of appetite, and fatigue. In some
cases, side effects can be severe and even
life-threatening, so tell your doctor if you have
any of them.

BRAF inhibitors: Mutations in the
BRAF gene cause melanoma cells to
produce proteins that help cancer cells
grow. About half of melanoma skin
cancers have a BRAF mutation. BRAF
inhibitors include vemurafenib (Zelboraf),
dabrafenib (Tafinlar), and encorafenib
(Braftovi). These drugs attack the BRAF
protein directly and can shrink or slow the
growth of tumors in melanoma that has
spread or can't be removed completely.

If you develop a reaction on your skin
(rash, itching, swelling) after you have any
of the systemic therapies listed above, it is
recommended that you see a dermatologist
regularly for treatment.

MEK inhibitors: MEK inhibitors are
often used with BRAF inhibitors. The MEK
protein works with the BRAF gene. That
means medications that target the MEK
protein can also treat melanomas with
BRAF mutations. They include trametinib
(Mekinist), cobimetinib (Cotellic), and
binimetinib (Mektovi).

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

KIT inhibitors: Some rare melanomas,
such as those that occur on the palms,
soles, or under nail beds, have specific
KIT gene mutations. KIT inhibitors include
imatinib (Gleevec), dasatinib (Sprycel),
and nilotinib (Tasigna).

4 Treatment overview » Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the
immune system to kill cancer cells. The body’s
defense against disease is called the immune
system. T cells are a key part of this system.
T cells that kill infected and cancer cells are
called cytotoxic or killer T cells.

Are there vaccines that treat
melanoma?
There are vaccines that can treat
melanoma. But unlike vaccines for
flu, pneumonia, and other illnesses,
melanoma vaccines don’t prevent
melanoma. Instead, melanoma vaccines
can be used to stop cancer from returning
if you already had surgery to remove
tumors. Vaccine therapies for melanoma
are often tested in clinical trials. Vaccines
for melanoma can be given either through
systemic or local treatment.

Your immune system can tell the difference
between normal cells in the body and those
it sees as foreign, such as germs and cancer
cells. This allows the immune system to attack
the foreign cells while leaving normal cells
alone.

Checkpoint inhibitors
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a type of
immunotherapy. They work by easing the
brakes on your body’s T cells. Immunotherapy
can be given alone or combined with other
types of treatment.

Systemic treatment is usually given
through drugs that release antigens
through the bloodstream to boost the
body’s immune system so it can fight
cancer. These drugs target the parts of
melanoma cells that make them different
from normal cells. They work differently
from chemotherapy drugs, which attack
both normal and cancer cells.

The immune system has brakes that prevent or
slow down an immune response. The brakes
are called immune checkpoints. They protect
the body’s healthy cells. Proteins called CTLA4 and PD-1 are two types of brakes on T cells.
The immune system does this by using
checkpoint proteins on immune cells. The
checkpoints act like switches that need to be
turned on (or off) to start an immune response.
In some cases, cancer cells find ways to use
these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by
the immune system.

Local treatment directs antigens to a
specific organ or area of the body, such
as an abnormal growth on the skin. After
surgery, these treatments could include
forms of topical therapy (medicine in a
lotion or cream that is applied directly to
the skin).

Checkpoint inhibitors are injected into a vein
(infusion). It may take up to 30 to 60 minutes
to get the full dose. Infusions are usually
given every few weeks. The number of weeks

IL-2

between treatments can depend on the type of
inhibitor used.

Interleukin 2 (IL-2, Proleukin) is a type of
immunotherapy that can be injected into the
vein or directly into the cancer tumor. IL-2 is
a naturally occurring protein that is made by
a specific type of white blood cell, called a T
cell. It works by stimulating the immune system
to target and kill cancer cells. This therapy
can also be used with TIL (tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes) therapy.

Examples of checkpoint inhibitors that are
used to treat melanoma include:


Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)



Nivolumab (Opdivo)



Ipilimumab (Yervoy)



Atezolizumab (Tecentriq)



Nivolumab/Relatlimab-rmbw (Opdualag)

Side effects of IL-2 can include fever, chills,
decrease in blood pressure, muscle stiffness,
diarrhea, dizziness, tiredness, headache,
weight gain, nausea, vomiting, and loss of
appetite.

In some cases, combination therapy including
immunotherapy and/or targeted therapy is
recommended for treatment. Two examples of
combination therapies are:


Nivolumab + ipilimumab



Nivolumab/relatlimab-rmbw

TIL
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy
is an immune cell treatment that uses the
patient's T cells or TILs. These T cells are
collected from a patient's own tumor in a
laboratory. Once isolated from the tumor
sample, the TILs are expanded into the billions
and infused back into the patient.

Checkpoint inhibitors can cause immunerelated side effects, including rash, diarrhea,
shortness of breath, headache, and abnormal
thyroid function. These side effects can occur
during or after treatment and be lifelong.

Side effects are common and include anemia,
high fevers, and drops in levels of platelets and
certain white blood cells. Most of the time, they
resolve within a couple of weeks.

Read about immune-related side effects at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

T-VEC
Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (IMLYGIC)
is a modified form of the herpes virus made in
a lab. T-VEC is a type of viral immunotherapy,
which uses a genetically formed virus to
stimulate the body’s immune system. It is
injected directly into a tumor. T-VEC destroys
tumor cells and also helps your body find and

damage, and hair loss. These side effects
often go away after you finish treatment.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including both cancer
cells and normal cells. Chemotherapy drugs
are usually given through injection into a vein
or are taken through a pill (by mouth).

Radiation therapy

Because chemotherapy doesn't work as well
to treat melanoma as immunotherapies and
targeted therapies, your care team will likely use
those therapies first to treat your melanoma.

Radiation therapy (RT) using photons, protons,
or electrons can be used to kill cancer cells
and shrink tumors.

But if your disease does not respond to
immunotherapy or targeted therapy, or if you
have severe side effects, chemotherapy may
be an option.

RT can be given alone or with other
treatments. Treatment may focus on individual
tumors, a small area of the body, or a specific
lymph node area. RT can also be used as
palliative treatment to help ease pain or
discomfort caused by cancer.

Types of chemotherapy drugs that can be used
to treat melanoma include:


Dacarbazine (also called DTIC)



Temozolomide (Temodar)



Nab-paclitaxel



Paclitaxel



Cisplatin



Carboplatin

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the
most common method used. A large machine
makes radiation beams that are directed at
the tumor. The beams overlap at the site of
the tumor or cancer cells to focus the high
dose of radiation to that area. A much lower
dose is given to nearby tissue. How often the
treatment is given is based on the goal of your
treatment and where the melanoma is located.

Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy

If you are given chemotherapy, you may
receive treatment for up to several months.
Side effects include feeling tired, nausea or
vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nerve
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
uses many small beams of different strengths.

40

4 Treatment overview » Radiation therapy

“

This allows a high dose of radiation to be
targeted at the tumor while limiting the amount
of radiation to the surrounding normal tissue.

It is important to find a support
network that understands your
cancer type and the journey you
are taking. Learning from others
and having a safe place to ask
questions is a huge benefit.”

Image-guided radiation therapy
Image-guided RT (IGRT) uses imaging to
deliver radiation to cancer. Imaging can
confirm exactly where the tumor is in the body
both before and during treatments.

Radiation therapy for distant
disease
Other radiation techniques that can be used to
treat distant metastatic disease are:




Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treats
small tumors with very precise, highdose x-ray beams and is usually finished
in 1 session. It is preferred for brain
metastases.
Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a form
of SRS and is finished in 1 to 5 sessions.

SRT used to treat tumors in the body, and not
in the brain, is sometimes called stereotactic
body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic
ablative body radiotherapy (SABR).
If you have radiation therapy, you could
experience some side effects, including:


Sunburn-like skin problems



Changes in skin color



Hair loss in the area where the radiation
enters the body

4 Treatment overview » Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Phases
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.








Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety,
and side effects of an investigational drug
or treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

4 Treatment overview » Key points

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Finding a clinical trial
In the United States

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

tissue (called the histologic margin) may be
considered.

Testing to identify early-stage melanoma will
include a physical exam and medical history
and may include imaging tests to check for
specific signs or symptoms. Stage 0 has no
subgroup but Stage 1 and Stage 2 are further
broken down into subgroups described below
and in Chapter 3: Staging.

Follow up
Recommended steps after treatment for Stage
0 melanoma include a medical history and
skin exams at least once a year, which may
help detect other skin cancers. You won’t need
imaging tests and blood tests.

Stage 0 in situ

Stage 1

Stage 0 in situ refers to melanoma that is
found only in the top layer of skin (epidermis).
This stage is very unlikely to spread to other
parts of the body. It is cured when completely
removed.

Stage 1 melanoma has moved into the
second layer of skin called the dermis.
When melanoma reaches the dermis, it is
described as invasive. Stage 1 is defined as
a lesion (tumor) that is thinner than or equal
to 2 mm (Breslow depth or thickness). Stage
1 melanoma may or may not be ulcerated,
though most are not. Stage 1 melanoma is
broken down into two subgroups: 1A and 1B.

Treatment
The standard treatment for Stage 0 in situ is
wide excision surgery. Wide excision surgery
removes the melanoma tumor as well as
some normal-looking tissue surrounding it (the
surgical margin).

Stage 1A

There are some areas where it is harder to
do surgery, such as on the face, ears, palms
of the hands, and soles of the feet. In these
cases, surgical techniques that can provide

This stage is defined as a tumor that is less
than 0.8 mm thick and doesn’t have a break
on the skin (ulceration) under the microscope.
It is considered still localized to the skin, but is

invasive, which means that it has gone through
the top layer of skin into the next layer of skin.

Recommended steps after treatment for
stage 1A melanoma include a physical exam
and medical history, with a focus on the skin
and regional lymph nodes near the primary
melanoma site, every 6 to 12 months for 5
years, and then every year afterward. Imaging
tests will be done only to check specific signs
and symptoms.

Treatment
Wide excision surgery is used to treat stage
1A melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB) is usually not recommended at this
stage.

Guide 5
When you might have a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
A sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node where cancer cells spread after leaving a
tumor. An SLNB shows if cancer has spread from a tumor. It helps doctors tell the stage of
your melanoma and can help you and your care team make treatment decisions.
You might need an SLNB if:
Your cancer is stage
1A and:

• The melanoma is less than 0.8 mm deep
• The melanoma has no breakage
(ulceration) or other features

Recommendation:
Your doctor will not
likely discuss an
SLNB.

Your cancer is stage
1B and:

• The melanoma is less than 0.8 mm deep
and has ulceration
• The melanoma is 0.8 to 1 mm deep with or
without ulceration
• The melanoma may have moved into your
lymph nodes

Recommendation:
Your doctor might
discuss and consider
SLNB.

Your cancer is stage
1B or higher and:

• The melanoma is less than 0.8 mm deep
• The melanoma may have moved into your
lymph nodes
• You had a prior wide excision, rotational
flap, or skin graft closure
• You had an in-transit metastasis or local
recurrence of a melanoma but no sign of
regional or distant metastases

Recommendation:
Your doctor will
likely discuss and
recommend an SLNB.

5 Treatment for stages 0 to 2: Early stage » Stage 2

Stage 1B

out whether cancer cells are in one or more
nearby lymph nodes (see Guide 5).

Stage 1B melanoma includes tumors that are
less than 0.8 mm thick with ulceration (broken
skin) and tumors that are between 0.8 mm and
1 mm with or without ulceration; or a tumor
without ulceration that is more than 1 mm thick
but not thicker than 2 mm. The primary tumor
has moved into the lower layer of skin but is
still curable.

Your care team will discuss with you whether
an SLNB should be performed, based on any
health conditions you have, your age and
general health, and your personal preferences.
Your doctor may consider nodal basin
ultrasound (US) testing before the SLNB, if
results of the physical exam were unclear.
A normal nodal basin US does not replace a
biopsy of lymph nodes that may have cancer.

Keep reading for treatment as stage 1B is
treated the same as stage 2A.

If you hear you have a negative result, it
means the cancer has not spread to nearby
lymph nodes. However, a positive result
indicates that cancer is present in the sentinel
lymph nodes, and that other lymph nodes may
be affected.

Stage 2
Stage 2 refers to tumors that are 1 to 2 mm in
thickness and are ulcerated, or tumors that are
thicker than 2 mm with or without ulceration.
A person with stage 2 melanoma has a
higher chance of cancer spreading beyond
the primary tumor than a person with stage 1
melanoma.

If the SLNB results find cancer in lymph nodes,
the cancer will be upstaged to stage 3. The
cancer will also be upstaged to stage 3 if very
tiny tumors, called microscopic satellites,
are found in the surgical margin. For more
information on stage 3 melanoma treatment,
see Chapter 6: Treatment for stage 3.

Stage 2 melanoma is broken down into three
subgroups: 2A, 2B, and 2C.

Stage 2A

If no cancer is found in lymph nodes, you may
start follow-up care.

Stage 2A melanoma also includes two types of
tumors: One that is between 1 mm and 2 mm
that with ulceration or one that is between 2
mm and 4 mm without ulceration.

Follow up
Recommended steps after treatment for
stage 1B to 2A melanoma include physical
exams and medical history with a focus on
the skin and regional lymph nodes, every 6 to
12 months for 5 years, and then every year
afterward as needed. Imaging tests will be
done only to evaluate for specific signs and

Treatment
Primary treatment for stage 1B through stage
2A is the same and includes wide excision
surgery. Your doctor may also discuss an
SLNB. If your melanoma meets the criteria
for this staging procedure, an SLNB will find

symptoms to check to see if the cancer has
returned.

Your doctor should discuss with you the pros
and cons of pembrolizumab or nivolumab for
treatment. Factors to consider, in addition to
the stage of your disease, include your age,
how active you are, your personal and family
history of autoimmune disease, and how toxic
systemic therapies might be for you.

Stage 2B or stage 2C
Stage 2B melanoma is defined as a lesion
(tumor) that is thicker than 2 mm but no thicker
than 4 mm with ulceration, or the melanoma is
thicker than 4 mm without ulceration.

If cancer is found in the SLNB, your cancer will
be upstaged to stage 3. For more information
on stage 3 treatment options, see Chapter 6:
Treatment for stage 3.

Stage 2C means the melanoma is thicker than
4 mm, and the outermost layer of skin covering
the tumor is ulcerated.

Follow up

Treatment

Recommended steps after treatment for
stage 2B and 2C include a physical exam and
medical history, with a focus on the skin and
lymph nodes, every 3 to 6 months for 2 years,
and then every 3 to 12 months for 3 years,
then yearly after that point.

Primary treatment for stage 2B or 2C is the
same and involves wide excision surgery. An
SLNB may be done for complete (pathological
also known as surgical) staging and is strongly
recommended before adjuvant immunotherapy
with pembrolizumab or nivolumab.

Imaging tests will be done to evaluate any
concerning signs and symptoms. Your doctor
may consider imaging tests every 3 to 12
months for 2 years, and then every 6 to 12
months for another 1 to 3 years to look for the
return (recurrence) or spread (metastasis) of
melanoma. Imaging tests are generally done
when a person receives adjuvant therapy.

Following surgery and if no cancer is found
in sentinel lymph nodes, close follow-up care
is recommended and may include imaging
studies to help detect melanoma recurrence.
After talking with a medical oncologist, some
people choose to receive adjuvant therapy
with pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Though not
used often, you may receive radiation therapy
to areas where tumors are likely to return.
Adjuvant pembrolizumab or nivolumab can
help reduce the chance of cancer returning.
However, you could experience longterm immunotherapy-related side effects.
If you are being considered for adjuvant
therapy, pretreatment imaging is generally
recommended.

Stage 3 melanoma is considered

melanoma is based on whether one or more of
these 4 features is found:

an advanced form of cancer. In
this stage, the melanoma has

spread to the nearby lymph nodes,
lymph vessels, or other parts
of the skin but has not spread

further than that. There are many
treatment options depending on
the features of the melanoma.

Stage 3 features
Stage 3 melanoma means the cancer has
spread from the main skin tumor to nearby
areas. It is called regional melanoma because
the cancer has spread but not far. Stage 3

Nearby lymph nodes with cancer
may be found. Lymph nodes are small
bean-shaped structures that help fight
disease. When distant nodes have
cancer, the cancer is stage 4.
Microscopic satellites
(microsatellites) are tiny skin tumors that
are next to or below the main skin tumor
and can be seen only with a microscope.
Satellite tumors are deposits of
melanoma in the lymph vessels no more
than 2 cm from the main tumor. They are
large enough to be seen or felt during a
skin exam.
In-transit tumors are lymph vessel
deposits that are farther than 2 cm from

Satellite and in-transit tumors
Melanoma cells can spread from the main tumor through the lymph system. This system
consists of small vessels and bean-shaped structures called lymph nodes (shown in

the main tumor but haven’t reached the
lymph nodes.

Systemic therapy travels in
your bloodstream to treat
cancer anywhere in the body.

It is important to know which stage 3 features,
outlined above, define the melanoma. Stage
3 melanoma involves the lymph node (N)
stage and can have any tumor stage (T1–T4)
and the metastasis (M) stage is always M0,
because there is no distant spread.

Features and subgroups

Stage 3C
In stage 3C, the tumor can measure anywhere
from less than 2 mm thick to more than 4 mm
thick with or without ulceration; it can involve
anywhere from 1 to 4 lymph nodes found by
physical exam or imaging tests; and/or any
number of lymph nodes matted together; and/
or it involves microsatellite tumors, satellite,
tumors, or in-transit metastases on or under
the skin.

Stage 3 cancer is further broken down into
4 subgroups: 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D. Each
subgroup describes the extent of stage
3 melanoma. Stage 3A is less advanced
melanoma while stage 3D is more advanced.
The way stage 3 is treated depends on its
features, which help determine the subgroup.
For more information on staging and the TNM
staging system, see Chapter 3: Staging.

Stage 3D

Stage 3A

Stage 3D indicates the tumor is more than 4
mm thick with ulceration; cancer is found in 4
or more lymph nodes, or any number of lymph
nodes matted together; or involves 2 or more
lymph nodes and/or any number of lymph
nodes matted together with microsatellite
tumors, satellite tumors, and/or in-transit
metastases on or under the skin.

Stage 3A melanoma means the tumor is 1
mm thick or less with or without ulceration or 2
mm thick or less without ulceration. Between
1 to 3 lymph nodes have cancer detected
microscopically after a sentinel lymph node
biopsy (SLNB).

Stage 3B

Ask your care team to explain why the
melanoma is stage 3. You may also be able to
find this information in pathology reports.

Stage 3B indicates the tumor can be less
than 1 mm thick or up to 4 mm thick with or
without ulceration; involves anywhere from
1 to 3 lymph nodes found by physical exam
or imaging tests; and/or it has microsatellite
tumors, satellite tumors, or in-transit
metastases on or under the skin.

6 Treatment for stage 3: Regional » Cancer in the sentinel nodes

Cancer in nearby lymph nodes is a common
feature of stage 3 melanoma. There are two
ways that cancer is found in the lymph nodes:




preferred treatment without further lymph
node removal, called completion lymph node
dissection (CLND). CLND should only be
used with certain patients and circumstances
because of its side effects like lymphedema
(swelling due to buildup of lymph fluid in
the fatty tissue just under your skin near the
surgery site), as well as extensive surgery,
longer recovery time, and hospitalization.
If signs of cancer appear, adjuvant (after
surgery) treatment can be received at that
time.

The pathologist confirmed cancer in
abnormal nodes that were detected by a
physical exam or imaging and biopsied
before treatment
The pathologist found cancer in the
sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)

Cancer in the sentinel
nodes

Treatment
After imaging surveillance, the next step is
adjuvant treatment. Before choosing one of
the adjuvant systemic therapies or observation
(also referred to as active surveillance), your
care team should consider both your risk of
cancer returning (recurrence) and how toxic
the systemic therapies might be for you.

A sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node
where cancer cells most likely spread from
a primary tumor. When cancer is found in
sentinel lymph nodes, it is called sentinel node
positive. Testing and treatment depends on the
number of nodes with cancer.

If your cancer is considered a low-risk stage,
for example, the toxicity of adjuvant therapy
may outweigh any potential benefit you might
receive from the treatment. Because of that, it
may not be recommended.

Tests
For stage 3A, your care team may consider
imaging for staging. For stages 3B, 3C, or 3D
that have cancer in sentinel nodes, imaging
for staging is recommended. If melanoma
involves the lymph nodes or other parts of
the body, BRAF V600 mutation testing is
considered to determine whether targeted
therapy is an option.

But if your doctor recommends adjuvant
therapy, options are:

When sentinel lymph nodes have cancer, other
nearby nodes may have cancer, too. Cancer
care options include surveillance that involves
a series of imaging tests to check nearby
lymph nodes (called the nodal basin).

Nivolumab



Pembrolizumab



Dabrafenib/trametinib or other BRAF
or MEK inhibitors for people with BRAF
V600 mutation

As mentioned above, another option is
undergoing observation. Observation means
active surveillance and includes clinical skin

Active nodal basin ultrasound or other types
of imaging (CT, PET-CT, or MRI) are the
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024



53

6 Treatment for stage 3: Regional » Cancer in the lymph nodes

and lymph node exams, attention to any
concerning signs and symptoms, and/or
imaging surveillance, when needed.

Your care team will discuss and decide
if surgery can remove all the melanoma
(meaning it’s resectable). See Guide 6 for
treatment options.

Cancer in the lymph nodes

Treatment
Before surgery, you may receive drug
treatment to improve outcomes. This treatment
is called neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant
therapy may consist of immunotherapy,
targeted therapy, or both.

Your care team may have detected abnormal
lymph nodes before starting treatment,
possibly during a physical exam or through
imaging. Then a biopsy confirmed cancer in
these nodes, which is referred to as clinically
positive lymph nodes. Cancer at this stage
could be 3B, 3C, or 3D.

Clinical trials have shown a benefit to receiving
neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. But
experts are still studying which drugs work
best, in which patients, and how long treatment
is needed.

Tests
Further recommended tests are:

or symptoms of cancer

treated with surgery
(resectable)

Treatment may include three phases:
• Neoadjuvant therapy with immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or both
• Surgery with a wide excision and therapeutic lymph node dissection
(TLND)
• Adjuvant therapy with systemic drugs, radiation therapy, or
observation

If cancer can’t be
treated with surgery
(unresectable)

• Systemic therapy is the preferred option
• Radiation therapy (palliative) for symptom relief
• T-VEC skin injection
• Best supportive care

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

6 Treatment for stage 3: Regional » Cancer in the lymph nodes

You may be treated with one of these preferred
drug options as part of neoadjuvant therapy:


Pembrolizumab



Nivolumab/ipilimumab

Adjuvant therapy is
sometimes used in addition
to primary treatments to
boost their effectiveness.

Other recommended options include:


Nivolumab



Nivolumab and relatlimab

And you may receive adjuvant radiation
therapy. This is not often recommended since
it only treats the region where the lymph nodes
were removed and not other areas. It may
be used alone, but its use has mostly been
replaced by the cancer drugs listed above.

Used in some cases:


Dabrafenib/trametinib (if BRAF V600
mutation positive)

Another option is to have surgery, which
consists of a wide excision of the tumor while
removing nearby lymph nodes. This is called
a therapeutic lymph node dissection (TLND).
The number of lymph nodes removed depends
on the involved lymph node basin.

One other option is observation and is based
on your care team’s decision of the risk of
the melanoma’s recurrence and the risk of
treatment toxicity (side effects of treatment).
Observation means active surveillance
and includes clinical skin and lymph node
exams, attention to any concerning signs and
symptoms, and/or imaging surveillance, when
needed.

TLND will be performed if you had neoadjuvant
therapy first or can be done without
neoadjuvant therapy.
After surgery, your care team will decide if
more treatment may help stop the cancer from
returning. Treatment after surgery is called
adjuvant therapy.

But if surgery is not an option (considered
unresectable), the preferred treatment is
systemic therapy (see Chapter 8:Treatment for
stage 4, Guide 8) for therapies.

If the cancer is likely to return in the regional
lymph node basin, you may receive adjuvant
systemic (preferred) therapy that includes
these options:


Nivolumab



Pembrolizumab



Otherwise, you may get relief from palliative
radiation therapy, T-VEC (virus that is injected
into the skin tumor and triggers your body to
find and attack nearby cancer cells), or best
supportive care or a combination of these
treatments.

6 Treatment for stage 3: Regional » Microsatellites

Microsatellites
Systemic therapy decisions
should be based on your
specific goals and tolerance.
How long you receive
systemic therapy depends on
the stage of your melanoma
and how well your disease
responds to treatment.

Stage 3 melanoma may involve microscopic
satellites (microsatellites) so named because
these tiny tumors can only be seen with
a microscope. Stage 3A does not involve
microsatellites. But if microsatellites are found
in the biopsy, the melanoma can be upstaged
to a pathological stage 3B. For all stages,
microsatellites are found in either:

A skin biopsy sample removed before
treatment

or

The tissue removed during surgery

Tests

best to forego an SLNB, which is ideally done
at the same time as the wide excision.

The tests for melanoma with microscopic
satellites include:





After surgery, you may have more treatment
called adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy
treats any cancer cells that may have been left
behind. If you didn’t have an SLNB or you had
one and no cancer was found in lymph nodes,
options include participation in a clinical trial or
systemic therapy with:

Imaging tests for staging
Imaging tests to assess signs or
symptoms of cancer
BRAF mutation testing if you might have
adjuvant therapy (described below) or
enroll in a clinical trial

Once tests have been completed, your doctor
may discuss having a sentinel lymph node
biopsy (SLNB) to see if the cancer has spread
to the lymph nodes. An SLNB will remove the
tissue from the first lymph nodes where fluid
from the tumor drains.

Nivolumab



Pembrolizumab



Dabrafenib/trametinib (but only if BRAF
V600 mutation positive)

Observation is also an option. Observation
means active surveillance and includes clinical
skin and lymph node exams, attention to
any concerning signs and symptoms, and/or
imaging surveillance, when needed.

Treatment
Primary treatment will be wide excision surgery
and possibly an SLNB. If you had a wide
excision before, your care team may think it’s

treatment shrinks the tumor first.

Melanoma may spread and form nearby skin
tumors called satellite or in-transit tumors.
These tumors are seen or felt during the skin
exam and then confirmed to be cancer by
biopsy.

Treatment: Limited resectable
disease
There are four options in initial treatment for
limited resectable cancer:

Tests
Other recommended tests to determine if
surgery is necessary include:





Imaging for staging and to assess signs
or symptoms of cancer



BRAF mutation testing if not already done



When the cancer can be removed with surgery,
it is called resectable. Cancer that cannot be
treated with surgery is called unresectable.
Sometimes satellite/in-transit tumors can
be considered either limited resectable or
unresectable/borderline resectable. This
means the tumor is on the border (outside

BRAF V600 mutation positive. Or your doctor
might just observe you with clinical exams and
imaging studies for any new cancer signs or
symptoms.

After treatment, your doctor will perform a skin
exam and you may undergo imaging. The next
treatment is based on test results:


If you received a complete excision to clear
margins as initial treatment and there are no
signs of remaining cancer cells, you might
receive adjuvant systemic treatment options or
observation.



If cancer cells remain, read the section below
on unresectable/borderline resectable disease
for treatment options.



Treatment: Unresectable/
borderline resectable disease
Instead of upfront surgery because it’s
considered unresectable/borderline resectable,
initial treatment options include systemic
therapy, which is preferred (see Chapter 8:
Treatment for stage 4, Guide 8). Or you
could have local therapy options that include:



T-VEC (talimogene laherparepvec),
which is preferred
• Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is a type of
immunotherapy and only helpful in some
cases

If no cancer remains after systemic
therapy, you will move to observation.

Recommended follow-up tests for stage 3
melanoma include:

Palliative (limited) surgery or local
ablation (minimally invasive) therapy



Regional chemotherapy is another option
for local satellite/in-transit melanoma that’s
confined to an arm or leg. The treatment is
called isolated limb infusion or isolated limb
perfusion (ILI/ILP) with melphalan and treats
just the limb involved with the melanoma.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

If there are no signs of cancer after
local or regional therapy, you may start
adjuvant systemic therapy (nivolumab,
pembrolizumab or dabrafenib/trametinib
if BRAF V600 mutation positive) or start
observation with periodic surveillance
imaging.

For all of stage 3, follow up care involves
ongoing testing for new signs and symptoms
of cancer, also known as observation. It is
described in Chapter 9: Follow-up care. Follow
up starts when there are no signs of cancer
after treatment.

Local satellite recurrence and in-transit
recurrence both mean the cancer has returned
in the lymph vessels. It is usually found either
within or surrounding the primary melanoma
scar. Local satellite recurrence can feel like a
firm bump in or around that area.

Treatment: Limited Resectable
When cancer has limited resectable
disease, your first treatment options may be
neoadjuvant systemic therapy (see Guide
7), or complete excision to clear margins,
T-VEC injection, or systemic therapy (see
Guide 8 in Chapter 8:Treatment for stage
4). After T-VEC or systemic therapy, you may
have more surgery if cancer remains.

In-transit recurrence is usually found between
the primary site and regional lymph nodes. It
means the cancer has returned and formed
tumors in the lymph vessels between the
melanoma scar site and the regional lymph
nodes, but not in the lymph nodes themselves.
These two types of recurrence are tested and
treated the same way.

After surgery, you may receive adjuvant
systemic therapy. It may consist of one of the
following:

Tests
Testing for local satellite or in-transit
recurrence includes these options:

When melanoma recurs, it often appears
as lumps under the skin or in the lymph
nodes.
True scar recurrence refers to skin
tumors that formed from cancer cells that
remained near the surgery scar.
Treatment for true scar recurrence
consists of surgery to remove the tumor
and possibly lymph nodes. After surgery,
you may receive adjuvant therapy.
Local satellite recurrence and in-transit
recurrence both mean the cancer has
returned in the lymph vessels.
Treatment options for local satellite
recurrence are based on whether surgery
is an option. If there are no signs of
cancer after treatment, you may receive
more treatment to improve outcomes or
start observation.
Nodal recurrence means melanoma was
found in your lymph nodes.
Treatment for nodal recurrence depends
on whether or not the cancer is removable
by surgery. If surgery is not an option, the
preferred treatment is systemic therapy.

Widely disseminated metastases refers to
cancer that has spread to many distant sites.
It is unresectable, which means it cannot be
completely removed with surgery.

Treatment of brain metastases

In some cases, ipilimumab might be used if
you already had anti-PD-1 therapy, or you
might undergo observation (clinical exams and
surveillance imaging) with your doctor.

The first step in treating widely disseminated
metastases is to learn if the cancer has
reached your brain. Brain metastases are often
treated first to prevent serious health problems.

If cancer remains in your body (called residual
disease), see the next section on widely
disseminated (spread), for treatment options.

Your care team will meet to discuss treatment
options. It is recommended that the team
include a neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist,
and medical oncologist. Treatment of brain
metastases usually includes both systemic
therapy listed in Guide 8 and local treatment
to the brain.

After systemic therapy for primary
treatment
If you received systemic therapy for
oligometastatic melanoma, you will have
imaging tests to assess whether the therapy
worked.




For local treatment, surgery is preferred if large
brain metastases are causing symptoms or if
there is a single metastasis. You may receive
radiation therapy after surgery. When radiation
therapy is used for treatment, stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS) is the preferred method. This
is an external beam radiation therapy that uses a
high dose of radiation directly into the tumor.

If the cancer remains after treatment, see
treatment options for widely disseminated
metastases.
If the cancer stayed the same, you may
have a resection. After the surgery, you
may receive the same adjuvant therapy
mentioned above, if there are no signs of
cancer.

Sometimes, brain metastases are treated with
the goal of relieving symptoms. This is called
palliative care. Palliative options include:


Corticosteroids to relieve swelling



Anticonvulsant therapy to control seizures



Bevacizumab

Treatment of body metastases

Metastatic melanoma may be treated with
multiple lines of systemic therapy. The first
treatment given is referred to as first-line
therapy. Second-line therapy is the second
treatment used. If more lines of therapy are
needed, other second-line options may be
tried. See Guide 8 for systemic therapy
options for metastatic melanoma.

Treatment options for metastatic melanoma
not in the brain include:








Systemic therapy (this is the preferred
treatment)
Palliative resection and/or radiation
therapy

Preferred regimens work better, are safer, or
cost less than other options. Your medical
oncologist may not prescribe a preferred
regimen. Ask why because there are different
reasons for this decision.

Intralesional T-VEC injections to treat
metastatic skin lesions
Best supportive care

For more information about palliative care, see
NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Palliative Care
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Non-preferred regimens also have benefits for
people with melanoma. They may extend life,
delay cancer growth, or reduce symptoms.
Be sure to ask your care team if you have
questions about any of your options.

Stage 4 melanoma has
many treatment options.

Stage 4 cancer, also referred to as
metastatic cancer, is cancer that has
spread from its origin to distant parts of
the body.

There are always options. You
know your body best and must
advocate for what would best
meet your needs. Second and
third opinions should always be
encouraged and if something
doesn't feel right, speak up and
take action.”

Metastatic melanoma is treatable and has
many options.
When cancer has spread to only a few
distant sites it is referred to as limited
metastatic disease.
Limited metastatic disease is considered
resectable, which means it can be treated
by surgery.
Widely disseminated metastatic disease
refers to cancer that has spread to many
distant sites.
If brain metastases occur, they will likely
be treated first with systemic therapy and/
or local treatment.
The preferred treatment for body
metastases is systemic therapy.

Imaging tests

Skin and lymph node exams

If you had a past positive lymph node exam,
your doctor might consider more imaging
testing (for example, an ultrasound or CT
scan). This could be followed by a more
thorough imaging biopsy if your doctor feels it
is needed.

Your doctor may do exams on your skin and
lymph nodes at least once a year depending
on the melanoma stage. Your doctor should
also explain how you can do self-exams of
your skin and your lymph nodes at home.
It’s important to regularly look for any new,
changing, or unusual spots on both exposed
and non-exposed skin.

How often you receive follow-up testing
depends on how likely it is that your cancer will
return, which can also depend on your family
history of melanoma, if you have a high mole
count, or if you have any signs of atypicallooking moles.

What you can do:



Examine your skin regularly – If
you spot anything that looks out of the
ordinary or doesn’t look normal, get it
checked out as soon as possible.
See your health care provider
annually for a skin exam – Ask
for a full-body skin exam by a health
professional once a year. You may want
to consider a skin exam more often if you
are at higher risk for skin cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

Total-body photography to help with
ongoing monitoring of moles on the skin

This is especially important if you develop
atypical-looking moles (moles that are called
dysplastic under a microscope) or other
suspicious skin surfaces. Though they are
usually non-cancerous, they can put you at
greater risk of developing future melanoma.

Genetic tests

Preventing melanoma

Your clinical and family history might call for
multigene testing, which can help doctors
know if you have a higher genetic risk for
developing melanoma and other cancers. This
information can help guide recommendations
for monitoring and early detection in both you
and your family members.

There are steps you can take to help stop
melanoma cells from reforming. These are
especially important if you are at higher risk and
have sun sensitivity or a lighter complexion:


You might be referred for genetic counseling
and p16/CDKN2A testing if your history has
3 or more instances of diagnoses of invasive
cutaneous melanomas, pancreatic cancer,
and/or astrocytomas (cancers of the brain or
spinal cord) that run in your family.





Multigene panel testing that includes CDKN2A
may also be recommended if you have a
relative diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
Testing for other genes that can harbor
melanoma-predisposing mutations may also
be needed.



Limit time in the sun
Use caution when spending time
outdoors. Reduce your risk of skin
cancer by limiting sun exposure,
wearing protective clothing, and
using sunscreen.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Melanoma, 2024

74

Reduce UV (ultraviolet) radiation
exposure – This means reducing your
exposure to the sun and avoiding the use
of indoor tanning beds and other devices.
Prevent sun damage – Limit your sun
exposure between peak hours of 10:00
am and 4:00 pm.
Wear protective clothing – This
includes a wide-brim hat, clothes made
with UV-protective fabric, and sunglasses.
Use sunscreen – Choose a broadspectrum sunscreen with a sun protection
factor (SPF) of at least 30 and reapply
at least once every 2 hours. Sunscreen
should be applied 15 minutes before
going outside.
