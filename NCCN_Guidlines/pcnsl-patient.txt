from lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are white
blood cells that fight infections. Cancer is what

lymphocytes.

have the confidence to make wellinformed decisions.

Primary CNS lymphoma starts in lymphocytes
in the immune system. The immune system is
your body’s natural defense against infection
and disease. Having an impaired immune
system may increase the risk of developing
this cancer.

What is primary CNS
lymphoma?
Primary central nervous system lymphoma is
a rare and aggressive cancer that affects the
central nervous system (CNS).

Primary CNS lymphoma can spread to other
areas within the nervous system. For example,
it may spread from the brain to the eyes. But
it rarely spreads to other areas of the body.
However, a different kind of lymphoma—called
secondary CNS lymphoma—starts in another
part of the body but then spreads to the brain
or spinal cord.

Let’s break it down word by word to
understand it better:
Primary – Primary means first. When
talking about cancer, primary refers to the
place where cancer first started. Primary
CNS lymphoma starts in the central nervous
system.

This book is only about primary CNS
lymphoma.

Central nervous system – The CNS is
made up of the brain and spinal cord. Primary
CNS lymphoma occurs more often in the brain
than in the spinal cord, but it can also involve
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and/or the eyes.

What is the CNS?

Brain

Spinal cord

The central nervous system (CNS) receives signals from your senses, processes
information, and controls your body’s responses. The CNS includes:




The brain, which controls functions of the body such as feeling, moving, thinking,
and learning. The eyes are connected directly to the brain and are also part of the
CNS.
The spinal cord, which transmits messages between the brain and the body.

Because the CNS is so important, your body has parts that protect it. These include:


Meninges, which are membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord.



Cerebrospinal fluid, which is a liquid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord.



Bones including the skull that shields your brain and the vertebrae that surround
your spinal cord.

What causes primary CNS
lymphoma?



Every person diagnosed with cancer wants to
know how they got it. Although no one knows
exactly what causes a lymphoma, we do know
that lymphomas often start with a genetic
abnormality (mutation) in certain lymphocytes.
This abnormality causes these lymphocytes
to grow out of control (become cancerous).
The abnormality occurs on its own. It’s not a
mutation that occurs in other cells or organs in
your body. And it’s not typically passed down in
families (hereditary mutation).





Although primary CNS lymphoma is rare, it
could happen to almost anyone. However,
some people with certain risk factors have a
greater chance.



Risk factors
A risk factor is something that increases your
chance of developing a disease. For example,
having a reduced immune system increases
the risk of developing primary CNS lymphoma.
Risk factors don’t necessarily cause a disease
(and just because you have risk factors, it
doesn’t mean you'll definitely get the disease).
But people with primary CNS lymphoma often
have one or more of these risk factors:


Having an immunodeficiency
disorder, which is an illness that
weakens the immune system’s ability to
fight infections and diseases. Primary
CNS lymphoma is frequently linked to
HIV, the immunodeficiency virus that
causes AIDS.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, 2024

7

Carrying the Epstein-Barr
virus, which is the virus that causes
mononucleosis (“mono”) and other
illnesses. Epstein-Barr is one of the most
common viruses in humans. Most people
are infected with it. After you’re infected,
the virus remains dormant (inactive or
“sleeping”) in your body for life.
Having an autoimmune disease,
such as lupus, in which the immune
system overreacts and attacks healthy
tissues and organs.
Having an organ transplant, which
requires medications that suppress the
immune system. This leads to a higher
risk of infections.
Being an older adult. Although primary
CNS lymphoma can occur at any age, the
majority of people diagnosed with it are in
their 60s or 70s.

1 Guideline basics » How is primary CNS lymphoma diagnosed?

How is primary CNS
lymphoma diagnosed?

If these tests show that you have primary CNS
lymphoma, your care team should discuss
your treatment options with you. If possible,
seek care at a center with experience in
treating lymphomas in the brain.

Primary CNS lymphoma is often found when
a person develops symptoms. A symptom
is a feeling or problem that may be a sign
of disease. Symptoms usually develop over
several weeks. Primary CNS lymphoma can
cause a variety of symptoms.

Can primary CNS
lymphoma be cured?

Symptoms are often related to the lymphoma’s
location in the central nervous system. The
most common location is in the central part of
the brain. A lymphoma located here may cause
specific nerve changes such as leg or arm
weakness, or problems with coordination or
movement.

Curing primary CNS lymphoma is rare, but
it may be possible if it’s diagnosed early and
treated immediately. Sometimes the bigger
problem is managing the major side effects
of the intense treatment. People who are
younger, healthier, and more physically fit have
a better chance for a cure.

Other such symptoms may include changes
in personality or behavior, depression,
confusion, memory problems, loss of bladder
control (incontinence), or difficulty speaking or
swallowing.

In most people, primary CNS lymphoma can’t
be cured, but it can be treated. Treatment can
slow down its growth and reduce its symptoms
for a period of time, and prolong life. The
main treatments for primary CNS lymphoma
include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem
cell transplant, or a combination of these
treatments. Joining a clinical trial of a potential
new therapy is another recommended option.

As the lymphoma tumor grows, it puts
pressure on the CNS. This pressure often
leads to neurological symptoms and difficulties,
including headaches, nausea, vomiting, or
seizures. Changes in eyesight, such as blurry
vision or double vision, can also occur.

Treatment may be able to put primary CNS
lymphoma into remission. Remission means
there are no symptoms or signs of cancer.
Remission may last for months or years.
However, even with the best treatment,
primary CNS lymphoma often comes back
(relapses) in the brain, spinal cord, or the eye.

You’ll need several tests to confirm whether
you have primary CNS lymphoma or a
lymphoma that started in another part
of your body, or a different disease with
similar symptoms. Important tests include a
neurological exam, imaging (MRI or CT scan),
and biopsies. A biopsy means taking a sample
of fluid or tissue from your body to look for
cancer. You’ll also have blood tests, an eye
exam, and other tests.

It’s true that primary CNS lymphoma is fatal for

A message to caregivers and loved ones
This book is for you, too. This book will help you understand this disease and the challenges
it presents. People with lymphoma in the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)
commonly develop problems with brain function. This can show itself in multiple ways, such
as slower thinking, memory loss, difficulty moving or walking, trouble speaking, inability to do
everyday activities, changes in behavior, losing one’s sense of self, and other problems.
Helping a person with primary CNS lymphoma can be challenging and time-consuming. You
may be providing physical, mental, emotional, and hands-on support. You may be taking the
patient to appointments, helping to lessen side effects, and even assisting with treatment
decisions. Gather as much help as you can. Start with the online resources listed in the back
of this book.

Performance status

identify primary CNS lymphoma

Your care team will want to know how well
you can do ordinary day-to-day activities—like
taking a walk, climbing stairs, cooking dinner,
carrying laundry, or taking a bath or shower.
This evaluation is called performance status.
The more activities you can do, the better
your performance status. Your care team uses
this evaluation to get a sense of the level of
treatment you may be able to handle and
whether you may be eligible for a clinical trial.

and to make a treatment plan. The
key to confirming the diagnosis
is removing a small sample of the
tumor tissue and testing it.

Many diseases have signs and symptoms
similar to primary central nervous system
(CNS) lymphoma, including neurological
illnesses and other types of brain cancer.
So it’s important to have tests to confirm
your diagnosis. If you're given a diagnosis of
primary CNS lymphoma, you’ll have more tests
to find out how far the cancer extends within
the central nervous system or if it has spread
to another area of the body. Tests are also
used to help plan your treatment.

Imaging
Imaging tests take pictures (images) of the
insides of your body. The images show areas
in the body that might have cancer. The
images can reveal a lymphoma’s location,
size, and other features.
MRI
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the
most useful imaging technique for identifying
primary CNS lymphoma. An MRI scan is good
at showing the spine and soft tissues, including
the brain, as well as other details that are
helpful for planning surgery.

Tests for diagnosis
If you haven’t yet been diagnosed with primary
CNS lymphoma, you’ll first have a physical
examination and some general assessments
of your health. These include a neurological
exam and an evaluation of your level of
activity. After these, you’ll have imaging scans
and one or more biopsies.

MRI uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of the inside of the body.
During an MRI, you’ll lie on a table that slides
into the scanning machine. (An open MRI
scanner may be an option at some health care
centers.) It’s important to lie still during the test
to get the best pictures. The machine makes
loud noises but you can wear earplugs.

Neurological exam
This exam involves some simple tests to check
your alertness, balance, coordination, reflexes,
hearing, and other senses. Your doctor may
also perform an eye exam to look at the health
of the nerves in the back of your eye.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, 2024

An MRI of the brain or spinal cord usually
requires a contrast agent (also called contrast
dye or just contrast). Contrast highlights areas
in organs, blood vessels, or other tissues
to make them easier to see. The contrast
12

After imaging
After the MRI or CT scan, your images will be
studied by a radiologist, an expert in analyzing
images of the nervous system. The radiologist
will convey the imaging results to your care
team. This information helps your team plan
what the next steps of your care should be.

is injected into the bloodstream through an
intravenous (IV) line before or during the
imaging test and later flushed out in urine.
The contrast agent used for primary CNS
lymphoma is called gadolinium.
You’ll have multiple MRI tests throughout
diagnosis and treatment. An MRI should be
done early on if your symptoms suggest a
brain tumor. It’s also used right after treatment
to see how well the treatment worked. You’ll
have more MRIs during follow-up to watch for
any recurrence or new growth.

If your imaging results suggest a primary CNS
lymphoma, the next step is a biopsy.

CT
If MRI is unavailable or not recommended for
you, you might have a computed tomography
(CT or CAT) scan instead. A CT scan uses
x-rays to take many images of your body from
different angles. A computer then combines the
pictures to make a 3D image.

MRI of the brain
Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is the most useful imaging
technique for identifying primary
CNS lymphoma. It’s important
to lie still during the test to get
the best images. Straps or other
devices may help you avoid
moving.

Biopsy

A stereotactic biopsy is done by a
neurosurgeon in an operating room. First,
you’ll be fitted with a frame or several tiny
markers around your head to aid the surgery.
Next, you’ll be given anesthesia to go to sleep.
A small area of your hair will be shaved down
to the scalp.

If imaging scans show something that may be
a primary CNS lymphoma, your care providers
will want to take a sample and test it. A
procedure that removes a small piece of tissue
for testing is called a biopsy. Getting a biopsy
is the only way to be certain that you have
cancer. A biopsy also gives your care team
clues on how to treat it.

The neurosurgeon will then make a little
opening in your skull and insert a thin, hollow
needle into the brain to remove a sliver of the
tumor. A computerized navigation system,
connected to MRI or CT imaging, will allow
the surgeon to target and remove the sample
with a high degree of precision. After removal,
the opening in your scalp will be closed with
sutures and you’ll be able to go home.

The standard method for diagnosing primary
CNS lymphoma is a stereotactic biopsy. It’s the
recommended procedure when a brain tumor
is in a hard-to-reach or vital area. It aims to
remove only enough of the tumor to make a
diagnosis.

eyes and spreads to the brain.) If lymphoma
occurs in the eye, it often forms in the back
of the eye, called the retina. The retina
converts what you see into signals, which it
sends through the optic nerves to the brain.
Lymphoma cells can also invade the vitreous,
the clear gel that fills the eye. When primary
CNS lymphoma involves the eyes, it’s called
vitreoretinal lymphoma.

After an MRI scan and a stereotactic biopsy
have confirmed a diagnosis of lymphoma in
the central nervous system, a few more tests
are needed to find out how far the cancer has
grown in the CNS and if it may have spread to
other areas of the body. Although many people
with primary CNS lymphoma have only one
visible tumor, others have multiple tumors on
their scan.

Everyone diagnosed with primary CNS
lymphoma should have a thorough eye exam.
This is done at an eye doctor’s office using
a slit lamp, a microscope with a bright light.
You’ll first be given drops in your eyes to widen
(dilate) your pupils. This gives the eye doctor
a better view inside your eyes. The eye doctor
will use the lamp’s bright light to examine the
retina, optic nerve, and other parts of your
eyes.

Testing after diagnosis also checks for signs of
cancer in the eyes, cerebrospinal fluid, blood,
chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and possibly
the bone marrow and testicles. These tests
include:

Eye exam
Your eyes are connected directly to the
brain by the optic nerves. So primary CNS
lymphoma doesn’t travel far to spread from the
brain to the eyes. (Very rarely it starts in the

a vitrectomy), your eye is first numbed with
anesthetic. Then a thin needle is inserted into
the eye. The needle removes a tiny amount of
vitreous, which is then tested for cancer cells.
In some cases, a vitrectomy alone can confirm
the diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma
without the need for brain biopsy.

A lumbar puncture is done only if it can be
performed safely and it won’t delay treatment.
If cancer cells are found in the spinal fluid, or
if you’re having symptoms, another MRI may
be needed to find out if there are any lesions in
the spine.

Lumbar puncture

is a procedure that removes a small amount
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for testing. CSF

Lumbar puncture
Cancer cells in the spinal fluid may or may not cause symptoms. A lumbar puncture
is used to learn whether cancer has spread to the spinal cord. First, the lower back is
numbed. Then a long, thin needle is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to
remove cerebrospinal fluid. The fluid is then sent to a lab for testing.

More imaging

Blood tests

It’s uncommon for primary CNS lymphoma to
spread outside of the central nervous system
or the eyes. Still, it’s important to have a look
at the rest of your body just to be sure. The
imaging methods most commonly used for this
are positron emission tomography (PET) and/
or computed tomography (CT).

Blood tests can also help establish the extent
of the cancer and provide other information
needed for planning your treatment. The
following blood tests are recommended:


PET imaging uses a small amount of a
radioactive drug to find cancer cells in the
body. After the radioactive drug is injected into
a vein, it causes cancer cells to show up as
bright spots on PET scans.



A CT scan takes many x-rays of the same
body part from different angles. A computer
combines all the x-ray pictures to make a
single detailed image. A CT scan of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis is recommended to look
for cancer that has spread to these areas. A
contrast agent is injected into the bloodstream
before the scan to make the areas of cancer
easier to see.





Sometimes PET is combined with CT (a PET/
CT scan). PET/CT imaging may be done with
one or two machines depending on the cancer
center. A PET/CT scan takes images of the
whole body to find cancer.
Imaging after diagnosis may also include an
ultrasound of the testicles. However, if the
whole-body PET/CT scan didn’t find anything,
then this imaging test may not be needed.

Complete blood count (CBC) is a
common blood test that measures the
number of red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets in a blood sample.
Comprehensive metabolic panel
(CMP) is a group of 14 different blood
tests that provides information about your
blood sugar, calcium, and electrolyte
levels, and the health of your liver and
kidneys.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is
an enzyme involved in converting food
into energy for the body. An LDH test
measures the level of this enzyme. A
high level of LDH can be a sign of cell
damage caused by cancer or other health
problems.
Human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) blood test is needed for
everyone with primary CNS lymphoma.
HIV that’s related to primary CNS
lymphoma requires specialized care and
treatment with antiretroviral therapy in
addition to cancer treatment.
Hepatitis B testing will be necessary
if you’re having immunotherapy treatment
and you’ve had this virus before (or you’re
at risk of getting it). Immunotherapy
can “reawaken” the hepatitis B virus
and cause illness that interferes with
treatment.

Bone marrow biopsy

What’s next?

Most bones have a spongy center called
marrow. The marrow is where new blood
cells are made. It’s uncommon to find cancer
cells in the bone marrow of people diagnosed
with primary CNS lymphoma. But if imaging
suggests the possibility of lymphoma in the
bones, your care team may recommend a
bone marrow biopsy.

After you’ve been diagnosed and have gone
through further testing to find out the extent
of your lymphoma, your treatment team will
discuss your results with you. You’ll also talk
about your choices for treatment. The next
chapter explains the different options for
treating primary CNS lymphoma.

In this procedure, a hollow needle is inserted
into the bone (usually at the back of the hip
bone) and a sample of marrow is removed.
The marrow sample is then sent to a lab for
testing.

Don’t dismiss your distress
Depression, anxiety, and distress are very common in people with cancer (and their
caregivers, too). About 1 in 3 patients with primary brain tumors develop clinical depression
and anxiety at some point. Up to 3 out of 4 people with primary brain tumors experience
psychological distress. Tell your treatment team if you’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed.
Ask them for help. You don’t have to cope with it by yourself.
Read more about cancer and distress in NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Distress During
Cancer Care, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for

A lumbar puncture is a procedure that
removes a small amount of cerebrospinal
fluid, which is tested for cancer cells.
HIV that’s related to primary CNS
lymphoma requires specialized therapy in
addition to cancer treatment. So everyone
with primary CNS lymphoma needs to
have an HIV blood test.

A stereotactic biopsy is a precise
technique that’s used when a brain tumor
is in a hard-to-reach or vital area.
After primary CNS lymphoma is
diagnosed, more tests are needed to find
out how far the cancer has grown and if it
has spread to any other area of the body.

List all your drugs and supplements
Your treatment team will ask you to write a list of all the prescription drugs you take and how
often you take them. Make copies of this list, which you can give to the many other providers
or specialists you may see.
Also be sure to tell your treatment team if you’re using any over-the-counter medicines
(including antacids, aspirin, or NSAIDs like ibuprofen) or supplements, vitamins, or herbs.
Some of these can interfere with your cancer treatment. For example, some supplements or
herbs can raise or lower the levels of chemotherapy drugs in your body. This may cause more
side effects or make your treatment less effective.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. Clinical trials are a key way to assess
new treatment approaches. After being
developed and tested in a laboratory, potential

and Drug Administration (FDA).

your team can make a treatment
plan.

There’s no single drug or procedure that’s best
for treating primary central nervous system
(CNS) lymphoma. The best treatment is the
one that works best for you.

Talk to your treatment team about whether a
clinical trial makes sense for you. Everyone
with cancer should carefully consider all the
treatment options available for their type of
cancer, including standard treatments and
clinical trials.

Treatment options include corticosteroids,
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted
therapy, immunotherapy, and stem cell rescue.
Receiving treatment in a clinical trial is also a
recommended option.

Who can enroll?

Therapies are often combined to treat cancer.
For example, chemotherapy may be given
with an immunotherapy drug, or several
chemotherapy drugs may be given together.
Chemotherapy is also an essential part of
having a stem cell rescue.

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in certain ways in
order to compare how their disease responds
to a specific treatment.

Surgery is not normally an option. Because
primary CNS lymphoma usually develops deep
within the brain tissue, removing it with surgery
is risky and may be more harmful than helpful.

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. This is
an agreement that confirms you’ve been fully

Finding a clinical trial

Start the conversation

In the United States

Don’t wait for your treatment team to bring
up clinical trials. Start the conversation and
learn about all your treatment options. Ask if
a clinical trial is available for your situation.
If you find a study that you may be eligible
for, ask your treatment team if you meet the
requirements. Try not to be discouraged if
you cannot join. New clinical trials are always
becoming available.

3 Treatment options » Steroids » Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy
NCCN experts recommend that
everyone with primary CNS
lymphoma should consider joining
a clinical trial for treatment.

Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that
damages and destroys rapidly dividing cells
throughout the body. Because cancer cells
divide and multiply rapidly, they’re a good
target for chemotherapy. But chemotherapy
harms healthy cells, too. The damage to
healthy cells can cause side effects.
Treatment may include a single chemotherapy
drug or a combination of drugs. A combination
of drugs is sometimes chosen because the
drugs work better when they’re used together.

Steroids
Corticosteroids (often just called steroids) can
shrink lymphomas and decrease swelling in
the brain. This can rapidly reduce the signs
and symptoms of the lymphoma. However,
steroids lose their effectiveness and cause
side effects when given long-term. So steroids
are only given for a short period of time usually
in newly diagnosed patients.

Most chemotherapy drugs for primary CNS
lymphoma are given intravenously (IV). This
means the medicine is slowly infused through
a tube into a vein in your arm or another part
of your body. The medicine travels in the
bloodstream to reach cells throughout the
body. Some chemotherapy drugs are taken by
mouth as a tablet or capsule.

Importantly, steroid therapy shouldn’t start until
after you have a biopsy and get a diagnosis.
This is because steroids can change the
appearance of lymphoma cells, making it
difficult for the pathologist to reliably diagnose
the disease.

Chemotherapy is given in cycles. One cycle
involves a few treatment days followed by
several days of rest. Different chemotherapy
drugs have different cycles. Common
cycles are 14, 21, or 28 days long. Having
chemotherapy in cycles gives your body
a chance to recover after receiving the
treatment.

Side effects of steroids
Common side effects of steroids are feeling
hungry, trouble sleeping, slow wound healing,
upset stomach, mood changes, and swelling in
the ankles, feet, and hands. Steroids may also
significantly increase blood sugar levels. Most
side effects of steroids go away after the drug
is stopped.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, 2024

Intrathecal chemotherapy
If cancer cells are found in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) or if an MRI of the spine shows
cancer, chemotherapy may be infused directly
into the CSF in some cases. This is known
as intrathecal or intra-CSF chemotherapy.
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in
select cases or as part of specific treatment
program for primary CNS lymphoma.

24

3 Treatment options » Chemotherapy

Intraocular chemotherapy
In rare cases, primary CNS lymphoma may
occur in the eye. In these situations, the
chemotherapy may be infused into a vein or
directly into the eye. Possible side effects from
intraocular chemotherapy include eye irritation,
infection, inflammation, and cataracts.
Cataracts can be treated with a routine
operation by an eye surgeon.

What about side effects?
A side effect is an unhealthy or
unpleasant physical or emotional
condition caused by treatment. Every
treatment for primary CNS lymphoma
can cause side effects.
Side effects depend on many factors,
such as the drug, the amount taken,
the length of treatment, and the person.
Each person has an individual response
to a drug. Some people have many
side effects. Others have few. Some
side effects can be very serious. Others
are not serious but are still unpleasant.
Most side effects appear shortly after
treatment starts and stop after treatment.
Other side effects are long-term or may
even appear years later.

Side effects of chemotherapy
Like other therapies, the side effects of
chemotherapy depend on many factors. These
include the drug, the dose, and the person.
Chemotherapy, especially in high doses, may
not be the right treatment for people who are
frail or older. These individuals may have a
difficult time dealing with the harsh side effects.
The main chemotherapy drug used to
treat primary CNS lymphoma is high-dose
methotrexate. Methotrexate is one of the
most effective drugs for treating many kinds
of cancers. But when given in high doses,
methotrexate may cause damage to the
kidneys, liver, and other organs. In severe
cases, kidney failure is possible. To reduce
this risk, you’ll have to stay at the hospital
during methotrexate treatment and receive
fluids through a vein in your arm. You may also
be given medicine to reduce the toxicity of
methotrexate and to prevent severe problems
in your kidneys and other organs.

Your treatment team will monitor your
side effects during and after your
treatment. Ask your team for a complete
list of common and rare side effects of
each treatment. If a side effect bothers
you, let them know. There may be ways
to prevent or avoid some side effects and
help you feel better.

Many cancer treatments, including
chemotherapy, can lead to birth defects. So
avoid becoming pregnant or getting someone
pregnant while on chemotherapy treatment.
Other side effects of chemotherapy include
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores, loss
of appetite, hair loss, low blood cell counts,

and feeling very tired or weak (fatigue).
Additional side effects are also possible.
Medicines are available during chemotherapy
treatment to help control most of these side
effects.

x-rays used for imaging, you won’t see or feel
anything during treatment. The total dose of
radiation is usually divided into small doses
given over several weeks. By giving a little
every day, the radiation damages the tumor
while better preserving the healthy tissue.

Read more about nausea
and vomiting side effects
in NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Nausea and
Vomiting, available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

The most commonly used radiation technique
for primary CNS lymphoma is treatment of
the entire brain, called whole-brain radiation
therapy (WBRT). Because primary CNS
lymphoma can occur in multiple spots
anywhere in the brain, WBRT is used to
treat the entire brain all at once. WBRT can
also reach the upper part of the spine and a
part or all of the eyeballs. WBRT even treats
microscopic tumors in the CNS that aren’t
visible on an MRI scan.

Radiation therapy
Before effective chemotherapy became
available to treat primary CNS lymphoma,
radiation therapy was the most commonly
used treatment. It’s still an option for treating
primary CNS lymphoma in people who can’t
have chemotherapy in the first phase of
treatment (induction).

You’ll need to remain as motionless as
possible during each scan. You may be fitted
with a mask or supports to help you keep still.

Another situation in which radiation is
sometimes used is in the second phase of
treatment (consolidation) to kill cancer cells left
over after induction treatment.

Side effects of radiation therapy

3 Treatment options » Targeted therapy

Side effects of targeted therapy

differ among people. Common side effects
include headaches, nausea, vomiting, and
loss of appetite. Fatigue may begin after the
treatment has finished and last for several
weeks. Most of these symptoms can be
controlled by medications during treatment.

Because targeted therapy aims at cancer cells
while mostly avoiding healthy cells, it may
have fewer side effects than chemotherapy.
Some common side effects include allergic
reactions, fever, chills, muscle aches, fatigue,
weakness, infections, nausea, and diarrhea.
These medications may also reduce the
number of blood-clotting cells (platelets) in
the body, increasing the risk of bruising and
bleeding. Medicines are available during
treatment to help reduce most of these side
effects.

Radiation therapy may be more likely
to damage the nervous system than
chemotherapy, especially in older adults.
Months or years after WBRT, patients may
develop memory problems, slowed thinking,
and trouble speaking. Fine motor skills, such
as handwriting or tying shoes, may also be
affected.

Immunotherapy

Talk to your treatment team about the benefits
of radiation therapy compared with the risk of
nervous system damage, including long-term
problems with cognition.

Immunotherapy uses your body’s immune
system—your natural defense against infection
and disease—to fight cancer. Immunotherapy
treats cancer cells throughout the body.

Radiation therapy for the eyes
Radiation therapy is also used to treat primary
CNS lymphoma in the eyes. WBRT can be
expanded to include the eyes. Or the radiation
can be focused only on the eyes but at a lower
dose. With either method, usually both eyes
are treated at the same time. Possible side
effects include vision problems that may be
temporary or permanent. Radiation therapy
may cause cataracts, for instance, which can
be treated with a routine operation by an eye
surgeon.

The main immunotherapy drug used for
primary CNS lymphoma is rituximab (Rituxan).
Rituximab is a type of immunotherapy called
a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies
hunt for specific proteins on the surface of
cancer cells. Cancerous blood cells (and some
healthy blood cells) have a protein on their
surface called CD20. Rituximab finds and
attaches itself to CD20 proteins. This helps
your immune system locate and then destroy
the cancer cells. Rituximab is given through an
IV infusion.

Targeted therapy

Side effects of immunotherapy

Targeted therapy is another treatment for
primary CNS lymphoma that can be combined
with chemotherapy. Targeted therapy drugs
attack specific parts of cancer cells to kill these
cells or to slow their growth and spread.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, 2024

Rituximab and other immunotherapies may
cause drowsiness, fatigue, constipation, joint
pain, loss of appetite, low blood cell counts,
serious blood clots, and rashes.

3 Treatment options » Stem cell rescue » Stem cell rescue

Stem cell rescue
A stem cell is a basic cell that can develop
into any kind of cell. Stem cells that become
blood cells are called hematopoietic stem
cells. Hematopoietic means “blood-forming.”
Blood-forming stem cells are made in the bone
marrow. But cancer and its treatment can
damage and destroy cells in the bone marrow.
When hematopoietic stem cells are damaged,
they may not supply all the blood cells that the
body needs.

Keep track of your
symptoms and side effects
Think about ways to keep track of
your symptoms and side effects when
they happen. You can make notes in
a weekly diary, on a calendar, or in a
smartphone app. Or create your own
way to record the symptoms or side
effects you experience. Some things to
track include:
•

Each treatment and any side effects
it caused

•

How long the side effect lasted

•

How the side effect affected your
quality of life

•

If you’re given a treatment for a side
effect, note how well the treatment
worked

A stem cell rescue is a way to jumpstart the
bone marrow to make more healthy blood
cells. Also called a hematopoietic stem cell
transplant, stem cell rescue uses your own
blood-forming stem cells to regrow your bone
marrow.
A stem cell rescue has 3 key steps:

Stem cell removal – First, some of
your healthy stem cells will be removed
from your blood or bone marrow. You may
need a few visits to collect enough stem
cells. These collected stem cells are then
frozen and stored for later.
High-dose chemotherapy – Next,
you’ll receive intensive chemotherapy to
kill any lymphoma cells in your body. The
chemotherapy also kills all the stem cells
in your bone marrow. Because your blood
count will be low, your body will be very
vulnerable to infections at this time and
you will feel very fatigued.
Stem cell replacement – After
chemotherapy, your healthy stem cells
will be thawed and returned back into
your body to “rescue” your damaged bone

migrate to the bone marrow and start to
grow new blood stem cells. This will also
begin to restore your body’s ability to
protect itself from infection.
You’ll grow back blood cells and bone marrow
in a few weeks, but it may take a year for your
body to fully recover. During this time, you’ll
have frequent blood tests and health checkups
until your bone marrow is restored and your
blood cell counts return to normal.

Your treatment team will consider many factors
to decide if a stem cell rescue is right for you.
Some of these factors include your fitness
level, health status, organ function, cancer
stage, previous treatments, other medical
conditions, available supportive care, and

High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue
First, stem cells are removed
(harvested) from the patient’s
blood or bone marrow. The
harvested stem cells are
concentrated and frozen for
preservation.

Next, the patient receives
high-dose chemotherapy to
destroy any cancer cells in
your body. This also kills all
the stem cells in the bone
marrow.

Lastly, the harvested
stem cells are returned
(transfused) to the patient,
where they’ll grow new,
healthy blood-forming stem
cells in the bone marrow.

additional factors—including your goals and
preferences. Because the procedure can be
risky and the side effects harsh, it may not
be a useful option for people who are older
or frail. Ask your team about the benefits and
risks of having a stem cell rescue.

Now that you’ve been introduced to the various
treatment options for primary CNS lymphoma,
the first step toward treatment is to come up
with the best possible treatment plan. This
plan involves a number of different health care
providers.

Side effects of stem cell rescue
Most side effects of stem cell rescue
come from the chemotherapy. High-dose
chemotherapy can result in nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, hair loss, mouth sores, and other
side effects. Medicines are available during
chemotherapy to help reduce most of these
side effects.

Multidisciplinary care
During the course of your diagnosis and
treatment, you’ll be cared for by numerous
doctors, specialists, and allied health
providers.
These may include a neuro-oncologist,
neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, medical
oncologist, pathologist, ophthalmologist,
nurses, primary care doctor, nurse
practitioners, physician assistants, palliative
care specialist, pain specialist, psychologist,
social workers, nutritionist, and rehabilitation
specialists like physical, occupational, and
speech therapists.

You’ll also likely feel tired and weak after the
procedure and while waiting for the new blood
stem cells to grow in the bone marrow. This
should get better over time as you recover.

Supportive care
Supportive care (also called palliative care)
is for relieving the symptoms of cancer and
the side effects of cancer therapies, and other
health issues related to the cancer.

When all these providers are working and
communicating as a team to help you, it’s
called multidisciplinary care.
It’s helpful to understand the role that each
team member plays. Keep a list of names
and contact information for each member of
your team. This will make it easier for you and
anyone involved in your care to know who to
contact with questions or concerns.

Supportive care is given at any stage of
disease, not just at the end of life. It isn’t
meant to treat the cancer, but rather to relieve
symptoms and make you more comfortable.
While one goal of treatment is to control
cancer, that should be balanced with the other
goal of treatment: maintaining quality of life.
For older patients who have other diseases
or conditions and aren’t able to fully perform
ordinary daily activities, supportive care by
itself may be a reasonable option.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, 2024

Ask who will coordinate your care and what
efforts can be made to schedule appointments
together.

Your multidisciplinary care team should clearly
discuss your care goals with you. Removing
or reducing the size of your lymphoma is one
goal of your team. But you and your team’s
other goals may include improving your overall
well-being, maintaining your ability to do dayto-day activities, reducing pain, getting good
nutrition, and lowering stress and anxiety. Your
multidisciplinary team will meet to discuss your
treatment and which options are best for you.

Quality of life
Quality of life refers to a person’s overall
enjoyment of life, including their sense
of well-being and ability to participate in
their usual activities. Your quality of life
should be the main priority that guides
your treatment and care. Successful
treatment isn’t just about reducing the
cancer. Other goals include minimizing
cognitive problems, reducing pain,
lowering anxiety and stress, carrying out
regular activities, being with friends and
family, and enjoying life as best as you
can.

process and explains the options
for each phase of treatment.

Although there are different treatment options
for primary central nervous system (CNS)
lymphoma, the treatment approach is often a
two-step process.

High-dose chemotherapy
The most effective chemotherapy drug for
primary CNS lymphoma is methotrexate.
Methotrexate has been used for many years to
treat a variety of cancers. It works by blocking
the body’s use of folate, a form of vitamin B.
Lymphoma cells can’t multiply and spread as
quickly without folate.

The first step is the induction phase, which
aims to wipe out all lymphoma cells or as
many as possible. The goal of the second
step, the consolidation phase, is to destroy
any cancer cells that may remain in the body
after the first phase. Consolidation is also for
preventing the lymphoma from returning.

High doses of methotrexate are needed to
overcome the blood-brain barrier and still have
enough strength to kill lymphoma cells. The
blood-brain barrier is a protective layer around
the brain that prevents germs, infections, and
other toxins from getting in. But it also blocks
some chemotherapy drugs like methotrexate
from reaching the brain.

Induction
The first (induction) phase of treatment can
last several months. Treatment typically
requires multiple courses of chemotherapy,
which are given while in the hospital. The
options for induction treatment are listed in
Guide 1 and discussed here:

For induction therapy, high-dose methotrexate
is given together with the immunotherapy drug
rituximab (Rituxan). Rituximab can be given on
its own but it usually works better when given
with chemotherapy.

Clinical trial

In addition to methotrexate and rituximab, one
or more other chemotherapy medicines such
as temozolomide, vincristine, and procarbazine
may also be included.

Clinical trials allow you to receive treatment
while also helping researchers learn more
about this uncommon cancer. Everyone
with primary CNS lymphoma is encouraged
to consider enrolling in a clinical trial. The

chemotherapy combinations are:

Supportive care
Supportive care is available for everyone with
cancer. It isn’t meant to treat the cancer, but
rather to relieve symptoms and make you
more comfortable. Speak to your care team
about how you’re feeling and if you’re having
any symptoms or side effects.





Consolidation

Thiotepa, busulfan, and
cyclophosphamide

However, if you have a higher risk of
infection or your body can’t handle a stem
cell transplant for other reasons, high-dose
chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may not
be a good option for you.

Consolidation is the second phase of
treatment. The purpose of consolidation is to
kill any cancer cells that may be left behind
after induction and to prevent them from
coming back. Not everyone with primary CNS
lymphoma will need consolidation treatment.

High-dose chemotherapy
Chemotherapy without stem cell rescue
may be a better fit for someone who isn’t
suited to receive a stem cell transplant. For
this consolidation option, the recommended
treatment is high-dose cytarabine with or
without etoposide.

Before starting consolidation, you’ll have a few
tests such as imaging and blood tests to find
out how well your induction treatment worked.
The results of your induction treatment will
guide your options for consolidation treatment.

Maintenance therapy
Continuing induction therapy with highdose methotrexate and rituximab is also an
option. Other options are rituximab alone or
temozolomide alone. When these treatments
are used for consolidation, they’re typically
given once a month for up to 1 year. This is
called maintenance therapy.

Induction result: Complete
response
If there are no signs of cancer after induction
therapy, you’ve had a complete response.
The next best outcome is an “unconfirmed”
complete response, which means that there
are minimal signs of cancer left in the body. If
you have a complete response or unconfirmed
complete response to induction, you may

4 Phases of treatment » Treatment for the spine

Radiation therapy
If you want to avoid more chemotherapy or
if chemotherapy is no longer a good option
for you, whole-brain radiation therapy is
recommended. Although radiation therapy has
risks, it can relieve symptoms and may control
the cancer for a while.

Radiation therapy
If more chemotherapy seems too harsh or
isn’t recommended for other reasons, lowdose WBRT may be an option. Lower doses of
radiation cause fewer side effects. So a lower
dose is typically used when WBRT is given for
consolidation.

Supportive care
If your body isn’t able to handle either
chemotherapy or WBRT, supportive care is
always an option. Supportive care can help
with cancer-related pain and discomfort as well
as medication-related side effects.

Induction result: Incomplete
response
If results show that cancer cells remain after
methotrexate-based induction therapy, you’ve
had an incomplete response. The next step is
to consider a different treatment to kill leftover
cancer cells, prevent neurologic damage, and
maintain quality of life. These options are listed
in Guide 2 and discussed here:

Treatment for the spine
If testing finds cancer cells in the spine or
spinal fluid, and if treatment with high-dose
methotrexate is thought to be too harsh
for you, your care team may recommend
intrathecal chemotherapy and possibly
radiation therapy to the spine.

High-dose chemotherapy
You could have a different chemotherapy
medicine than methotrexate for your
consolidation treatment. The recommended
chemotherapy is high-dose cytarabine with or
without etoposide.

What is the blood-brain barrier?
Your brain is a very important organ. It needs special protection to keep it safe and healthy.
To block germs, infections, and other toxins from getting in, the brain has a unique security
system. This protective layer is called the blood-brain barrier. It’s like a moat that surrounds
and protects a castle.
The blood-brain barrier does its job well—maybe too well. One problem with the barrier is that
it won’t permit most drugs in the blood to reach the brain. This includes many chemotherapy
drugs. However, scientists have learned that some chemotherapy drugs can cross the bloodbrain barrier more easily than others.

Read about relapsing and refractory lymphoma
in the next chapter.

In intrathecal chemotherapy, an anticancer
medicine is injected directly into the spinal
fluid. Intrathecal chemotherapy options for
primary CNS lymphoma include methotrexate,
cytarabine, and rituximab.

Key points


Treatment for the eyes
If tests find cancer cells in the eyes after
induction therapy, further treatment is needed.
Recommended options are intraocular (eye)
chemotherapy or radiation therapy.



Intraocular chemotherapy involves injecting
anticancer medicine, such as methotrexate
or rituximab, directly into the eyes. For
this procedure, you may need to go to an
ophthalmologist who specializes in this type
of treatment. If intraocular chemotherapy isn’t
fully effective or if you can’t have intraocular
chemotherapy, radiation therapy focused only
on the eyes may be another option.





What’s next?



After induction and consolidation treatments,
your primary CNS lymphoma may be
undetectable for months or perhaps years.
During this time, you’ll need regular imaging
tests and checkups to see if the cancer shows
signs of coming back. When cancer comes
back after a period of remission, it’s called a
relapse.





Lymphoma that remains (or gets worse) even
after induction and consolidation treatments is
called refractory.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, 2024

Treatment for primary CNS lymphoma
is often a two-step process that includes
an induction phase and a consolidation
phase.
The induction phase aims to wipe out
as many lymphoma cells as possible.
The recommended induction treatment
(other than a clinical trial) is high-dose
chemotherapy plus immunotherapy.
The blood-brain barrier blocks toxins
like germs and infections from reaching
the brain. But it also prevents some
chemotherapy and anticancer drugs from
reaching the brain.
The consolidation phase kills any cancer
cells left behind after the induction phase.
Consolidation also helps prevent the
cancer from returning.
High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell
rescue may be a consolidation option
for people who are healthy and strong
enough to undergo this intense treatment.
High-dose chemotherapy alone may be a
consolidation treatment for those who are
unable to have a stem cell transplant.
If cancer remains after methotrexatebased induction therapy, consolidation
therapy may be high-dose chemotherapy
(with a medicine other than methotrexate)
or radiation therapy. Supportive care is
also an option.

Cancer that doesn’t improve with treatment is
called refractory. Refractory is another word for
resistant—the lymphoma has become resistant

After treatment ends, the follow-up phase of
care begins. It’s important to go to follow-up
visits and stay in touch with your treatment
team. Follow-up care is for:

The return of cancer after a cancer-free period

Making sure the lymphoma is in remission
Watching for signs that the lymphoma
may be coming back

There is no single best way to treat refractory
or relapsed primary CNS lymphoma. The
best treatment is the one that’s best for you.
You’ll need to consider your quality of life and
how treatment and its side effects may impact
it. For some, especially those at higher risk
of complications, the best option may be no
therapeutic treatment at all.

Checking for any unexpected problems
related to the lymphoma or treatment

A key test during follow-up of primary CNS
lymphoma is brain imaging with MRI. Brain
imaging monitors for the return of the
lymphoma. NCCN experts recommend followup MRIs of the brain:


Every 3 months for the first 2 years



Every 6 months for the following 3 years



Once a year after 5 years

Of course, two options available to those with
relapsed or refractory primary CNS lymphoma
are:

Clinical trial – Seeking treatment in a
clinical trial is strongly encouraged. The
treatment you receive may or may not
work better than standard cancer care.
Ask your care team about current clinical
trials you may be eligible for.

5 Follow-up care and further treatment » If cancer remains or returns



You had high-dose chemotherapy

Supportive care – Supportive care is
for cancer-related pain or discomfort as
well as medication-related side effects.
The goal of supportive care is not to treat
the cancer, but to help with the emotional,
physical, and practical demands of living
with cancer.

If you had high-dose methotrexate-based
chemotherapy that resulted in a long
remission (more than 1 year), your care
team may recommend that you have it
again. It’s common to have the same type of
chemotherapy you had the first time around.
High-dose methotrexate can be given by itself
or with other chemotherapies. Treatment that
doesn’t include high-dose methotrexate is also
an option.

Other treatment options depend in part on your
previous treatment or treatments:

You had whole-brain radiation

If high-dose methotrexate-based
chemotherapy didn’t work or didn’t result in
a lasting cancer-free period, there’s more
than one option. Your team may recommend
chemotherapies or other anticancer treatment
that doesn’t include methotrexate. Another
option is radiation therapy with or without other
chemotherapy or anticancer treatment.

If cancer resists or returns after initial wholebrain radiation therapy (WBRT), radiation
should not be used again because of the
risk of damage to the nervous system.
Your treatment team may recommend
chemotherapy instead. Alternative
chemotherapies or anticancer medicines such
as rituximab, ibrutinib, or others may be added
or substituted for methotrexate. High-dose
chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may also
be an option in certain cases.

High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue
may also be an option for people who can
tolerate it.

The only type of radiation therapy that may be
given after initial WBRT is focal radiation. This
is radiation that focuses only on cancerous
areas of the brain, not the whole brain. Focal
radiation is given mainly to relieve symptoms,
not to treat the cancer.

You had high-dose chemotherapy
with stem cell rescue
If high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
rescue led to a complete remission that lasted
1 year or more, your treatment team may
suggest you have it again. If that’s too much
or not possible for you, then another option
is chemotherapy or other anticancer therapy
that doesn’t include methotrexate or stem cell
rescue.

If lymphoma is found in your spine or CSF, you
can have chemotherapy injected directly into
the spinal fluid.

If you didn’t have a lasting response to highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue,
radiation therapy may be an option. WBRT or
radiation that’s focused only on the lymphoma
may be used.

Supportive care (also called palliative care)
is appropriate for anyone, regardless of age,
cancer stage, or the need for other therapies.
Although end-of-life care is a part of supportive
care, supportive care is much more than that.
Supportive care is an important part of highquality, comprehensive cancer care. Its goal
is to control symptoms, relieve emotional
and physical suffering that comes from the
diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and
improve the quality of life for those with cancer
and their loved ones and/or caregivers.

Your comfort and quality of
life shouldn’t come second to
excessive tests and procedures
that won’t affect your outcome.

Follow-up visits are for making sure the
lymphoma is in remission. Follow-up also
looks for signs of its return and checks for
any unexpected problems.
MRI of the brain is used to monitor for the
return of primary CNS lymphoma. Other
follow-up testing is needed if cancer cells
are found in the spinal fluid or eyes.
Cancer that doesn’t improve with
treatment is called refractory. Cancer
that returns after a cancer-free period is
known as a relapse.



Enrolling in a clinical trial is strongly
encouraged for everyone with relapsed or
refractory primary CNS lymphoma.



Supportive care is available to everyone
with relapsed or refractory primary CNS
lymphoma. Other treatment options
depend in part on what treatment you’ve
had before.
If your initial treatment was WBRT,
the usual therapy for relapsed or
refractory disease is methotrexate-based
chemotherapy. Another chemotherapy
or anticancer medicine may also be an
option. High-dose chemotherapy with
stem cell rescue is another possible
treatment.
If your initial treatment was high-dose
methotrexate-based chemotherapy and
you had a remission that lasted more
than 1 year, the therapy for relapsed
or refractory disease may be more
methotrexate chemotherapy. This may be
given by itself or with other medicines.

If initial treatment with high-dose
methotrexate-based chemotherapy didn’t

Supportive care is appropriate for any
person with cancer, regardless of age,

It’s important to be comfortable

Think about what you want from treatment.

options and share concerns with your care
team. If you can build a relationship with your
team, you’ll feel supported when considering
your options and making treatment decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest
conversation with your care team.

Second opinion

It’s your choice

It’s normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer treatment shouldn’t
be put off for too long, there is usually time to
have another cancer care provider review your
test results and suggest a treatment plan. This
is called getting a second opinion, and it’s a
normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

Treatment decisions are very personal. What’s
important to you may not be important to
someone else.
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your team.

Seek out a specialist who focuses on cancer
in the brain, if you can, because they have
more experience with diagnosing and treating
people with central nervous system cancers.

Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:

Questions to ask

Support groups
Many people diagnosed with cancer and
their caregivers find support groups to be
helpful. Support groups often include people
at different stages of treatment. Some people
may be newly diagnosed, while others may
be finished with treatment. If your hospital
or community doesn’t have support groups
for people with cancer, check out the online
resources listed in the back of this book.

Possible questions to ask your care team
are listed on the following pages. Feel free
to use these or come up with your own. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment. Have a
notebook handy to jot down the answers to
your questions.

Financial concerns
The financial cost of cancer can be
overwhelming. As a result, many people with
cancer and their loved ones struggle with
the cost of treatment, as well as the stress of
paying for it.
If you struggle to pay for food, housing,
treatment, follow-up care, and other expenses,
or you have difficulty getting to appointments,
talk with your care team’s social worker, patient
navigator, and hospital financial services staff.
They can help you find financial support and
transportation options.
