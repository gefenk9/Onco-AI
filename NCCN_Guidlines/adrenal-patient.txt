Adrenal basics

Adrenal glands

Adrenal tumors form in one or both
adrenal glands. Adrenal glands produce
hormones that affect your body in
different ways. This chapter reviews the
basics of adrenal tumors.

Each adrenal gland has 2 main parts:


Adrenal cortex – This is the outer
part of the adrenal gland. The adrenal
cortex makes 3 main hormones: cortisol,
aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA). These hormones control
metabolism, blood pressure, and body
features (such as hair growth and body
shape).



Adrenal medulla – This is the inner part
of the adrenal gland. The medulla makes
3 hormones: epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine. These hormones control
the body’s response to stress. This
includes the “fight or flight” surge of
adrenaline.

Adrenal glands
Your body has 2 adrenal glands. They are
located on top of each kidney. Adrenal glands
are small, yellow glands that are important to
the body’s endocrine system. The endocrine
system is made up of tissues and organs that
produce hormones. Hormones are chemical
substances that are made in one part of the
body and carried through the bloodstream to
other parts of the body where they help control
how organs or cells work.

Adrenal glands
Adrenal glands are small,
triangle-shaped glands found
on the top of the kidneys. These
glands make hormones that help
to regulate your immune system,
response to stress, metabolism,
and other functions.

treatment. An adenoma that produces
too much of the hormone aldosterone is
called an aldosteronoma. Whereas, an
adenoma that produces too much of the
hormone cortisol (stress hormone) causes
a condition called Cushing syndrome.

Adrenal tumors can occur in one or both
adrenal glands. Most adrenal gland tumors are
benign (not cancer). Adrenal tumors often do
not cause symptoms and are found through
an imaging test such as a CT or MRI scan
performed for another reason.



Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) –
Although it is the most common type of
adrenal gland cancer, it is very rare and
affects approximately 1 to 2 people out of
every 1 million. Adrenocortical carcinoma
begins in the adrenal cortex. It can be a
functioning or nonfunctioning tumor. If the
tumor is functioning, it may produce more
than 1 hormone.



Neuroblastoma – This rare type of
adrenal tumor is cancerous. It affects
children ages 5 and under, though
it is most often found in infants.
Neuroblastoma can spread to other parts
of the body, including the bones.



Pheochromocytoma – This type of tumor
begins in the adrenal medulla and is
characterized by symptoms of high blood
pressure, headache, rapid heartbeat, and
sweating. Most pheochromocytomas are
benign, but can be cancerous.

Adrenal tumors are categorized in the following
ways:






Benign (not cancer) adrenal tumors do
not metastasize (spread) to other parts of
the body. This type of tumor is often found
by chance through imaging tests done for
an unrelated issue.
Functional adrenal tumors are usually
benign, although some are capable of
becoming cancerous and spreading.
Benign functional tumors can still produce
hormones and may be found during tests
for hormone-related symptoms.
Malignant adrenal tumors are
cancerous tumors. They are rare, with
about 300 to 500 people being diagnosed
each year. Certain genetic conditions may
increase the risk for these tumors.

Types

Adrenal tumor categories are further broken
down into types. They include the following:


Adrenocortical carcinoma
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an adrenal
cancer that starts in one or both of the adrenal
glands. It can occur at any age. But it’s most
likely to affect children ages 5 and under, and
adults in their 40s and 50s. If caught early,
adrenal cancer can be cured. However, if the
cancer has spread beyond the adrenal glands,
cure becomes less likely. Treatment can be
used to delay progression or recurrence.

Adenoma – This is the most common
type of adrenal gland tumor, also
referred to as adrenocortical adenoma.
It is a noncancerous tumor that can
be functioning or nonfunctioning. If
an adenoma is small and/or does not
produce excessive hormones, and is
not causing symptoms, it may not need

Signs and symptoms

Risk factors

Half of those with adrenal cancer will have
symptoms caused by hormones produced by
the tumor. Others may experience symptoms if
the tumor has grown so large that it is pressing
on nearby organs. If you have any of the
signs or symptoms listed below, make sure to
discuss them with your health care provider.

There are no known causes for most adrenal
tumors. However, some genetic (hereditary)
conditions can put you at risk for developing
an adrenal tumor. Hereditary conditions are
mutations passed down from biological parent
to child through genes. Those with one of the
conditions listed below might have a higher
risk for developing an adrenal tumor. This
accounts for only a small portion of cases.

Symptoms of adrenal cancer may include:


Weight gain



Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome



Muscle weakness



Carney complex



Pink or purple stretch marks on the skin



Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)



Hormonal changes such as excess facial
hair, hair loss on the head, irregular
periods, enlarged breast tissue, and
shrinking testicles



Hereditary paragangliomapheochromocytoma (PGL/PCC)
syndrome



Li-Fraumeni syndrome

Testing

Test results

Treatment planning starts with testing.
Testing is used to diagnose and plan
treatment for adrenal tumors. This
chapter presents an overview of the
tests you might receive and what to
expect.

Create a medical binder

Test results
Adrenal tumors will be diagnosed based on
a series of test results. Your diagnosis will
determine your treatment plan. It is important
you understand what these tests mean.

A medical binder or notebook is a great way
to organize all of your records in
one place.

Keep these things in mind:


Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.



Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.



Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about your specific disease.



Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.



Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician
informed of changes to this list.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Adrenal Tumors, 2022

•

Make copies of blood tests, imaging
results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

•

Choose a binder that meets your needs.
Consider a zipper pocket to include
a pen, small calendar, and insurance
cards.

•

Create folders for insurance forms,
medical records, and tests results. You
can do the same on your computer.

•

Use online patient portals to view your
test results and other records. Download
or print the records to add to your binder.

•

Organize your binder in a way that works
for you. Add a section for questions and
to take notes.

•

Bring your medical binder to
appointments. You never know when
you might need it!

Testing

General health tests

General health tests
What is your family
health history?

Medical history

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Tell your doctor about any symptoms you
have. A medical or health history will help
determine which treatment is best for you.

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families—those who are related to you
through genes passed down from parent
to child. This information is called a family
health history. You can ask family members
about their health issues like heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they
were diagnosed. For relatives who have
died, ask about the cause and age of death.

Family history

Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your doctor will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history. Ask family members about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed.

Start by asking your parents, siblings,
and children. Next, talk to half-siblings,
aunts and uncles, niece and nephews,
grandparents, and grandchildren.
Write down what you learn about your
family history and share this information
with your health care provider.

Physical exam

During a physical exam, a health care provider
may:


Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your weight and height



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat



Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched. Tell your doctor if you feel pain.



Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin. Tell your
doctor if you have felt any lumps or have
any pain.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Adrenal Tumors, 2022

Some of the questions to ask include:

13

•

Do you have any chronic diseases, such
as heart disease or diabetes, or health
conditions such as high blood pressure
or high cholesterol?

•

Have you had any other diseases, such
as cancer or stroke?

•

How old were you when each of these
diseases and health conditions was
diagnosed?

•

What is our family’s ancestry—from what
countries did our ancestors originate?

Testing

Imaging tests

Imaging tests

not use x-rays. Contrast might be used. An
MRI may be used as an initial test, to check
treatment results, and to see if the cancer has
spread to other parts of the body.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body. A radiologist, an expert in
interpreting test images, will write a report
and send this report to your doctor. Your test
results will be discussed with you.

PET scan

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
help see cancer cells in the body. PET scans
are performed about an hour after the tracer
is injected. PET scans are combined with
CT or MRI scans (PET/CT or PET/MRI) to
determine where the cancer cells are located.
This combined test is considered to be more
accurate than either scan alone. Types of
PET scans that can be helpful for those with
adrenal tumors include FDG-PET and SSTRPET.

CT scan

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture. In
most cases, contrast will be used.

Contrast

Contrast materials are not dyes, but
substances that help enhance and improve the
images of several organs and structures in the
body. Contrast is used to make the pictures
clearer. It might be taken by mouth (oral) or
given through a vein (IV). The contrast is not
permanent and will leave the body in your
urine after the test. The types of contrast vary
but are different for CT than for MRI.

FDG-PET/CT scan

An FDG-PET scan uses a radioactive type of
sugar (18-fluorodeoxyglucose) as its tracer.
Active cancer cells use sugar faster than
normal cells. This will make the cells look
brighter in pictures. Many adrenal tumors
are not fast-growing and not very bright on
FDG-PET scans. FDG-PET scans can help
determine if neuroendocrine tumors are
becoming more aggressive.

Tell your doctors if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines,
such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and
prednisone (steroids), to avoid the effects of
those allergies. Contrast might not be used if
you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys
are not working well.

SSTR-PET/CT scan

A somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist
is a protein found on the surface of cells
that bind to a hormone called somatostatin.
Somatostatin helps to control other hormones
in the body. SSTRs are found on many
different types of cells. A SSTR-PET uses a
tracer that binds to these SSTRs.

MRI scan

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does

Blood tests

Biochemical tests

Biochemical tests measure substances like
hormones in blood, urine, and/or saliva that
may be made by the adrenal tumor. Symptoms
may be seen when your body makes too
much of a hormone. Your doctor may consider
these tests if you may have an adrenal tumor
or syndromes caused by a tumor. More
information on biochemical tests can be found
in Guide 1.

Blood tests are used to look for signs of
hormone secretion or to see how well you are

Testing

Genetic tests | Biopsy

Adrenal vein sampling

Hereditary conditions

Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is a procedure
where blood is taken from both adrenal
glands to measure how much hormone is
being produced by each gland. A needle and
catheter (plastic tube) is inserted into the vein
of your groin. Contrast is used to map your
veins before the doctor places the tube.

Certain genetic (inherited) conditions may
increase your risk for developing certain
tumors. A syndrome is a group of signs or
symptoms that occur together and suggest
the presence of or risk for a disease. A genetic
risk assessment will identify if you carry a
cancer risk and if you may benefit from genetic
testing, additional screening, or preventive
interventions. Depending on the genetic risk
assessment, you might undergo genetic
testing and genetic counseling.

Genetic tests
Genetic testing is done using blood or
saliva (spitting into a cup). The goal is to
look for gene mutations. Not all mutations
are inherited. Mutations inherited from
your biological parents are called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You
can pass these germline mutations on to your
children. Also, other family members may have
these mutations.

Biopsy
Biopsies are rarely done for adrenal tumors. It
might be done to rule out pheochromocytoma.
A biopsy refers to obtaining a sample of
tissue or group of cells for testing. Your
sample should be reviewed by a pathologist
who is an expert in the diagnosis of adrenal
tumors. This review is often referred to as
histology, histopathology, or hematopathology
review. The pathologist will note the overall
appearance and the size, shape, and type of
your cells. Tests will be done on the biopsied
cells.

Tell your doctor if there is a family history of
cancer or tumors. Depending on your family
history or other features of your cancer, your
health care provider might refer you for genetic
testing to learn more about inherited risks for
cancer. You may meet with a genetic counselor
to discuss genetic testing options and/or to
explain your test results.

Image-guided needle biopsy

An image-guided needle biopsy refers to a
biopsy that uses an imaging tool (such as
ultrasound or CT) to guide the needle during
the procedure. This type of biopsy allows your
doctor to biopsy suspicious areas that are not
easily seen or felt through your skin.

Treatment team

This chapter presents an overview of
the treatment types for adrenal tumors.
Not every person will receive every
treatment listed in this chapter. Together,
you and your doctor will choose a
treatment plan that is best for you.

Treatment team

Your treatment team

Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of doctors, health care workers, and
social care professionals from different
professional backgrounds who have
knowledge (expertise) and experience with
adrenal tumors. This team is united in the
planning and implementing of your treatment.

Treating adrenal tumors takes a team of
experts. Your treatment team may include:
Diagnostic radiologist: interprets the
results of CTs, MRIs, and other imaging
tests.
Endocrinologist: specializes in the
diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the
endocrine system.

The MDT may include pathologists,
endocrinologists, radiologists (including
nuclear medicine specialists), nutritionists, and
medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists.

Genetic counselor: helps people
understand their risk or chance of developing
cancer, tumors, or other diseases.

Ask who will coordinate your care.
Your physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing are important. You know your body
better than anyone. Help other team members
understand:


How you feel



What you need



What is working and what is not

Oncologist: specializes in treating cancer.
Pathologist: analyzes the cells, tissues, and
organs removed during a biopsy or surgery
and provides cancer diagnosis and staging
information.
Surgeon: performs procedures to remove
tumors and cancer.

Keep a list of names and contact information
for each member of your team. This will make
it easier for you and anyone involved in your
care to know whom to contact with questions
or concerns.

Treatment overview

Surgery

Surgery

There are 2 types of adrenalectomy:

Surgery is the primary treatment for most
adrenal tumors. Primary treatment refers to
the main treatment used to get rid of a tumor
in the body. The method and extent of surgery
depends on where the tumor is located and
how far the disease has spread. Treatment
will be based on whether the tumor can be
removed by surgery (resectable) or cannot be
removed by surgery (unresectable).

Adrenalectomy

An adrenalectomy refers to surgery where one
(unilateral) or both (bilateral) adrenal glands
are removed. During the procedure, your
surgeon will remove the tumor and any areas
where the cancer has spread. This can include
lymph nodes or nearby structures.

Open adrenalectomy – This is used if
the tumor is large, might be cancerous, or
is likely to rupture. Your surgeon will make
and open incision on your abdomen to
remove the gland(s).



Laparoscopic adrenalectomy – This
is more commonly used. Your surgeon
will make small punctures (either in
your abdomen or back), then will use a
laparoscope to remove the gland(s). A
laparoscope is a thin tube with a camera
and a light that can help your surgeon see
inside your body.

Resection

A resection is a surgical procedure where a
tumor is removed. During the procedure, the
tumor along with a small amount of normal,
healthy tissue around the tumor will be
removed. This rim of normal, healthy tissue is
referred to as a surgical margin. If the surgical

Systemic therapy
Targeted therapy

margin has healthy tissue, then usually the
tumor has been removed in its entirety.

Targeted therapy focuses on specific or unique
features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies
seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and
move in the body. These drugs stop the action
of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/
or survive.

A positive margin refers to cancer cells found
at the edge of the tissue. This indicates that
not all of the cancer has been removed.
Despite best efforts this can happen.

Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy increases the activity of
your own immune system to fight cancer.
The immune system is the body’s natural
defense against infection and disease. By
changing how the immune system works,
immunotherapy improves your body’s ability to
find and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy
can be given alone or with other types of
treatment.

Systemic therapy
Systemic therapy works throughout the body.
Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might
be used alone or with other therapies. Goals of
systemic therapy should be discussed before
starting treatment.




Systemic therapy given before surgery is
referred to as neoadjuvant therapy.

For more information, read the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Immunotherapy
Side Effects, available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines.

Systemic therapy given after surgery is
referred to as adjuvant therapy.

Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells
and some normal cells. Chemotherapy drugs
work in different ways to kill abnormal cells
or to stop new ones from being made. When
more than one chemotherapy drug is used, it
is referred to as a combination regimen.
Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment
days followed by days of rest. This allows
the body to recover before the next cycle of
chemotherapy. The length of treatment and
rest days vary based on the chemotherapy
drugs used.

Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy

Stereotactic body radiation therapy

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
is a type of external beam radiation therapy
(EBRT).

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from x-rays, photons, electrons, and
other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink
tumors. RT can be given alone or with other
treatments. Treatment may focus on individual
tumors, a small area/region of the body, or
specific lymph nodes. RT may be used as
supportive care or palliative care to help ease
pain or discomfort caused by cancer.

SBRT may be used to:

Radiation therapy can also be given before,
during, or after surgery to treat or slow the
growth of cancer, especially if the surgical
margins have cancer cells.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses
a machine outside of the body to aim radiation
at the tumor(s) or areas of the body.
Common types of EBRT that may be used
include:
Three-dimensional conformal radiation
therapy (3D-CRT) uses computer
software and CT images to aim beams
that match the shape of the tumor.



Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT) uses small beams of different
strengths to match the shape of the
tumor.



Stereotactic body radiation therapy
(SBRT) uses high-energy radiation
beams to treat cancers in five or fewer
treatments.



Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) uses
special equipment to position the body
and give one precise, large dose of
radiation.

Somatostatin analogs | Observation

Somatostatin analogs

drug used to treat certain tumors that are
somatostatin receptor-positive. It binds to a
protein called somatostatin receptor, which is
found on some adrenal tumor cells. Lutetium
Lu 177-dotatate builds up in these cells and
gives off radiation that may kill them.

Somatostatin analogs are drugs used to
slow down or stop hormone production.
Somatostatin analogs are made to have longlasting activity in the body.
Somatostatin analogs that might be used to
treat adrenal tumors include:

be referred to as surveillance or watch-andwait. During this time, you will have tests on a
regular basis to look for any new or changing
symptoms. You will not have any treatment
during observation.

Radioactive drugs

Nuclear medicine therapy uses radioactive
molecules to target specific tumors. One
example is peptide receptor radionuclide

Clinical trials

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
diseases need to be studied in people. If
found to be safe and effective in a clinical
trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach
may be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Finding a clinical trial
In the United States

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Frequently asked questions

Informed consent

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

Start the conversation

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

General supportive care

Key points

Supportive care is health care that relieves
symptoms and improves quality of life. It might
include pain relief (palliative care), emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Tell your care team how you
are feeling and about any side effects. Best
supportive care, supportive care, and palliative
care are often used interchangeably.

Distress

Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt.
Depression, anxiety, and sleeping problems
are common in people with cancer. Talk to your
doctor and with those whom you feel most
comfortable about how you are feeling. There
are services and people who can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.
For more information, see NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Distress During Cancer Care,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines.

Fatigue

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Let your care
team know how you are feeling and if fatigue
is getting in the way of doing the things you
enjoy. Eating a balanced diet, exercise, yoga,
and massage therapy can help. You might be
referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with
fatigue.

Primary aldosteronism (Conn syndrome) Overview
Overview | Symptoms

Primary aldosteronism is a condition
caused by the adrenal glands
producing too much of the hormone
aldosterone. Without treatment,
this condition increases your risk of
cardiovascular diseases, including
heart attack and stroke. This chapter
provides information on the treatment of
primary aldosteronism, also known as
hyperaldosteronism or Conn syndrome.

Get to know your
care team and help
them get to
know you.

Overview
Primary aldosteronism refers to a condition
that occurs due to too much aldosterone being
produced by the adrenal glands. Aldosterone is
the hormone that helps to balance potassium
and sodium in the body. Too much aldosterone
will cause the body to hold sodium and lose
potassium, leading to elevated blood pressure.
Without treatment, this condition increases
your risk of cardiovascular diseases, including
heart attack and stroke. Also, low potassium
levels can cause heart rhythm irregularities.

Symptoms
The main symptom of primary aldosteronism is
high blood pressure and low potassium levels.
Other symptoms include:

Primary aldosteronism is also referred to as
hyperaldosteronism or Conn syndrome.

Treatment | Key points

Treatment

Key points

Treatment for hyperaldosteronism depends
on if excess aldosterone is being produced by
one or both adrenal glands. This is determined
by a test called adrenal vein sampling (AVS),
which can measure hormone levels from each
adrenal gland.


If both adrenal glands are affected,
high blood pressure (hypertension) and
low potassium levels (hypokalemia)
will be treated with medicine, either
spironolactone or eplerenone.



If only one adrenal gland is affected, an
adrenalectomy—surgery where one or
both adrenal glands are removed—is
recommended.

Almost all aldosterone-producing adrenal
tumors are benign and will be removed by
a laparoscopic surgery. If there is concern
that the tumor is cancerous, an open
adrenalectomy will likely be recommended.

aldosterone is being produced by just one
adrenal gland, removal of that adrenal

that can be fatal if left untreated.

Hypercortisolism symptoms caused by an
adrenal tumor include:

Overview
Hypercortisolism occurs where there is too
much cortisol in your body. Cortisol is a
hormone that helps the body use glucose
(a sugar), protein, and fats. A tumor of the

If your tumor is larger than 4 cm, has
irregular features on CT and/or MRI, or cancer
is suspected, your treatment will depend on
how far the tumor has spread.
If the tumor is localized (found in one part
of your body), an open adrenalectomy is
preferred. However, if the tumor has spread
to other sites of the body (liver, lungs, and
bones), chemotherapy may be recommended
instead of surgery. For more information
on non-surgical options, see Chapter 6:
Adrenocortical carcinoma for treatment
options.

Outlook
Symptoms of hypercortisolism can be
difficult to live with and may worsen without
treatment. Some symptoms such as hair loss,
excessive weight gain and abdominal stretch
marks, and physical changes such as “moon
face” or “buffalo hump” may make you feel
embarrassed or stop you from participating in
social events. Please note, symptoms can be
treated with medication. Work with your health
care team by reporting any new or worsening
symptoms or any concerns.

Treatment
Treatment for hypercortisolemia caused by an
adrenal tumor is based on tumor size. Tumors
are usually measured in cm. A golf ball is about
4 cm and a large pea is about 1 cm.
If your tumor is less than 4 cm and is
suspected to be benign, you will receive
an adrenalectomy (minimally invasive is
preferred).
An adrenalectomy refers to surgery where one
or both adrenal glands are removed. During
the procedure, your surgeon will remove
the tumor and any areas where the cancer
has spread, such as lymph nodes or nearby
structures.

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma

Paraganglioma is a tumor that arises
from neuroendocrine tissues found
along the spine. Pheochromocytoma
is a type of paraganglioma that forms
in the center of the adrenal gland
causing the adrenal gland to make
too much adrenaline. Paragangliomas
and pheochromocytomas can occur
in individuals with other inherited
disorders, such as von Hippel-Lindau
syndrome.

Pheochromocytoma

Pheochromocytoma is a rare, usually benign
(not cancer) tumor that develops in the center
of the adrenal gland. In pheochromocytoma,
the tumor grows from chromaffin cells.
Chromaffin cells produce hormones including
adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline
(norepinephrine).
Adrenaline and noradrenaline hormones
trigger your body’s fight-or-flight response
to threat. Your body’s response includes
an increase in blood pressure and a rapid
heartbeat. The hormones prepare your body to
react quickly to a threat. Pheochromocytoma
causes more of these hormones to be
released, even when you are not in a
threatening situation.

Overview
Paraganglioma

Paraganglioma is a rare type of tumor
that forms near blood vessels and nerves
outside of the adrenal glands that can cause
symptoms similar to a pheochromocytoma.
The nerve cells affected are part of the
peripheral nervous system (outside of
the brain and spinal cord). These tumors
are also referred to as extra-adrenal
pheochromocytomas.

A pheochromocytoma (or “pheo” for short)
can cause high blood pressure, pounding
headaches, irregular heartbeat, flushing of the
face, sweating, nausea, and vomiting.
For information on kidney-related
paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, see
NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Kidney Cancer,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines.

Paragangliomas can be found anywhere along
the spine from the base of the skull to the
pelvis. However, this chapter will only discuss
paragangliomas found near/outside the
adrenal gland.

Symptoms
Some people will develop symptoms, while
others will not. The most common symptom is
high blood pressure (hypertension). A common
feature with these types of adrenal tumors
is a frequent but sporadic (irregular) attack
of symptoms. These intense symptoms are
referred to as “paroxysmal attacks.”
These attacks may worsen as the tumor
grows. Some people have attacks because of
physical or emotional stress. Others are woken
up from sleep by symptoms.

The following blood, urine, and imaging tests
are recommended to determine if you have
pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma:


Plasma free or 24-hour urine fractionated
metanephrines and normetanephrines
with or without serum or 24-hour urine
catecholamines



Adrenal protocol CT (abdomen/pelvis)



Genetic counseling and testing for
inherited genetic conditions

If your tumor is unresectable, asymptomatic,
or slow-growing, your treatment will need to be
individualized to help control tumor growth and
manage any symptoms you are experiencing.


Additional testing may include:


Abdominal/pelvic multiphasic CT or MRI



SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI



FDG-PET/CT (skull base to mid-thigh)



Chest CT with or without contrast



MIBG (iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine) scan

If you have distant metastases, your
treatment will need to be individualized to help
slow tumor growth and manage any symptoms
you are experiencing.


Treatment
Before treatment, you will likely be prescribed
specific types of pills to lower your blood
pressure and heart rate. These typically
include alpha- and beta-blockers. You will also
be asked to take a high salt diet and drink a lot
of fluids for a few days before procedures such
as surgery.
One or more of the following might be added:


Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockade



Metyrosine

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Adrenal Tumors, 2022

If your tumor is secreting, a clinical trial is
preferred. Other treatments might include
systemic therapy, radiation therapy, or
radioactive drug therapy.

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma Surveillance
Surveillance

Surveillance
Surveillance tests are done at specific times
after treatment to check if the cancer has
returned. These tests can help find cancer
early so you can start treatment again, if
needed. Surveillance tests may include
general health tests such as a medical history
and a physical exam, and imaging tests. For a
list of recommended testing, see Guide 3.

Guide 3
Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: Surveillance tests
Every 12 weeks to 12 months
• Physical exam, blood pressure, and biochemical tests
• Possible chest CT with or without contrast and abdominal/pelvic CT or
MRI with contrast

Resectable disease
(after surgery)

Over 1 year up to 10 years
• Physical exam, blood pressure, and biomarkers
• Possible chest CT with or without contrast and abdominal/pelvic CT or
MRI with contrast
Over 10 years
• Surveillance as needed

Unresectable disease
or distant metatases

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Adrenal Tumors, 2022

Every 12 weeks to 12 months
• Physical exam, blood pressure, and biochemical tests
• Chest/abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast
• Chest CT with or without contrast and abdominal/pelvic MRI without
contrast
• MIBG (iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine) scan with SPECT/CT
prior to considering radionuclide therapy
• FDG-PET/CT for bone-dominant disease
• SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI prior to considering radionuclide
therapy

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma

Key points


Pheochromocytoma is a rare, usually
benign tumor that develops in the center
of the adrenal gland causing the adrenal
gland to make too much adrenaline.



Paraganglioma is a rare type of tumor
that forms near blood vessels and nerves
outside of the adrenal gland.



Some people will develop symptoms,
while others will not. The most common
symptom is hypertension (high blood
pressure).



You may be at risk for pheochromocytoma
or paraganglioma if you have a rare
inherited condition. Tumors associated
with these disorders are more likely to be
malignant (cancerous).



You will have blood, urine, and imaging
tests to diagnose a pheochromocytoma or
paraganglioma.



Before treatment, you will likely be
prescribed specific types of pills to lower
your blood pressure and heart rate. These
typically include alpha- and beta-blockers.
You will also be asked to take a high salt
diet and drink a lot of fluids for a few days
before procedures such as surgery.



Surveillance tests are done at specific
times after treatment to check if the
cancer has returned. These tests can
help find cancer early so you can start
treatment again, if needed.

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice | Questions to ask

It’s important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your doctor.

your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

Second opinion

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.
Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Questions to ask your doctors
Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
