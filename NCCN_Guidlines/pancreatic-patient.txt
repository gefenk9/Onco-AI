About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Version 2.2023 — June 19, 2023.

Many people with cancer wonder how they
got it. Experts don’t know exactly what causes
pancreatic cells to become cancer cells. But
they do know several factors that increase the
chance of developing pancreatic cancer. Such
risk factors include:

Familial malignant melanoma syndrome,
also known as melanoma-pancreatic
cancer syndrome or familial atypical
multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM)
syndrome
Hereditary pancreatitis

What are the stages of
pancreatic cancer?
The stages of pancreatic cancer range from
stage 0 to stage 4. Often, stages 1 through 4
are written with Roman numerals—stages I, II,
III, and IV. The cancer stages are based on the
size of the pancreatic tumor and how far the
cancer has spread.

Lifestyle factors, such as smoking
tobacco, heavy alcohol use, and a less
healthy diet
Major contact with cancer-causing
chemicals, such as pesticides

Health conditions, such as diabetes and
chronic inflammation of the pancreas

Stage 0 pancreatic cancer is only in the
innermost layer of the duct wall.
Stage 1 pancreatic cancer consists of a
tumor that is 4 centimeters or smaller and
has not spread outside the pancreas. For
comparison, a golf ball is 4.3 centimeters.
Stage 2 pancreatic cancer consists of a
tumor that is larger than 4 centimeters or
the cancer has spread to 1 to 3 nearby

cancer stages. Instead, they use a different
system to decide treatment for cancers that
are not metastatic. This system is described in
Chapter 5.

Stage 3 pancreatic cancer has grown
through the pancreas to nearby major
arteries or has spread to 4 or more lymph
nodes.

What is the best treatment
for pancreatic cancer?

Stage 4 pancreatic cancer has spread
far and commonly involves the liver,
lungs, or lining of the abdomen.

There’s no treatment for pancreatic cancer
that’s best for everyone. The best treatment
is the treatment that’s right for you. Your
treatment plan should follow best practices—
cancer care based on science and expert
consensus. The following chapters explain
the best practices of testing for and treating
pancreatic cancer.

What stage is metastatic cancer?
Stage 4 pancreatic cancer is metastatic
cancer, but other stages may become
metastatic cancer over time. Metastatic
pancreatic cancer has spread far from the
pancreas.

Is staging used to plan treatment
for pancreatic cancer?

Some people with stage 1, 2, or 3 pancreatic
cancer have surgery to remove cancer from
the body. Surgery is an option for more people
now than in the past due to medical advances.
Other types of cancer treatment are used with

Unlike other cancers, experts do not plan initial
treatment mainly based on the five pancreatic

Very rarely, pancreatic cancer is only
in the duct (stage 0) or only in the
pancreas (stage 1 or some stage 2).
Stage 2 and stage 3 also include
cancers that have spread to beanshaped structures called lymph
nodes (shown). Other stage 3 cancers
have grown to nearby arteries,
such as the celiac axis. Most often,
pancreatic cancer has spread far from
the pancreas, which is stage 4.

surgery to improve results. Ongoing research
is assessing whether it is better to receive
these other treatments before or after surgery.
Read Chapter 5 to learn more about treatment
with surgery.
For most people with pancreatic cancer,
surgery is not the best treatment. Instead,
drug treatment is most often used to control
cancer’s growth and reduce symptoms.
Research has compared current cancer drugs
to identify the best ones. In recent years, drug
regimens based on cancer markers have been
used to improve results. Treatment without
surgery is discussed in Chapter 6.

Advocate for yourself
Take steps to get the best care for you.
Here are 3 ways to advocate for yourself:

3 Read this book to learn about

pancreatic cancer and its treatment.
Use the questions in the back of the
book to discuss and decide with your
care team which care options are
right for you.

Clinical trials offer hope to all people with
pancreatic cancer. Clinical trials are a type of
health research that tests new ways of fighting
cancer. Ask your care team if there is a clinical
trial that is a good fit for you.

3 Choose a multidisciplinary team.

It takes a team of experts to treat
pancreatic cancer. Read this book to
learn which care providers are part of
the team. You choose your team by
deciding where to get care. Getting
a second opinion on treatment may
help you decide which treatment to
receive.

3 Be an active team member. When

discussing treatment, share your
goals with your team. Ask questions
when you don’t understand.
Supportive care is part of cancer care,
so tell your team about symptoms and
other challenges you have. Key parts
of supportive care are explained in
this book.

Some families share genes that increase
the risk of pancreatic cancer.
There are five stages of pancreatic cancer
that range from stage 0 to stage 4.

Multidisciplinary consult
There is no tell-tale sign of pancreatic cancer,
especially in early stages. Signs of pancreatic
cancer may also be caused by other health
conditions. Health care providers may suspect
pancreatic cancer based on symptoms, such
as yellowed skin or eyes called jaundice. Signs
of pancreatic cancer on x-rays include widerthan-normal pancreatic ducts or an inflamed
pancreas. If your provider suspects pancreatic
cancer, testing will be needed.

Because pancreatic cancer is complex, it takes
a team of experts to decide the best course
to diagnose and treat pancreatic cancer. This
team of experts should:

Imaging

A CT scan is a more detailed kind of x-ray.
It takes many pictures from different angles.
A computer combines the images to make
3-D pictures. A pancreatic protocol CT takes
pictures before contrast and multiple times
after contrast. The scan is finished in several
minutes.

Imaging takes pictures of the inside of the
body. It can show cancer deep inside the body.
Imaging of the pancreas is very important and
is often the first test for pancreatic cancer. It
is used to assess the cancer stage and plan
treatment.

Imaging of the pancreas is most often done
with CT, but you may undergo MRI instead.
MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio
waves to make images. A pancreatic
protocol MRI may show small tumors and
metastases not seen on CT. The scan is
completed in 30 to 90 minutes.

Imaging of the pancreas
Radiologists have identified which methods
best show cancer in and near the pancreas.
These methods are known as pancreatic
protocols. There are pancreatic protocols for
computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI).

A magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a type of
MRI that is usually part of the MRI pancreatic
protocol. It makes very clear pictures of the
pancreas and bile ducts. No contrast is used
because bile and other fluids act as contrast.

You'll receive contrast if it's safe for you to
receive. Contrast makes images clearer. You
will be injected with contrast. If undergoing CT,
you will also drink a liquid contrast. Contrast
travels in the bloodstream and is flushed out in
urine.

Imaging
Imaging is used to make
pictures of the insides of your
body. You will lie on a table that
will move into the tunnel of the
machine. You will need to lie
still during the scan. You may
be asked to hold your breath. A
radiologist will view the pictures
on a computer and look for
signs of cancer.

Imaging of other areas
Pancreatic cancer has often spread far by
the time cancer is diagnosed. Distant cancer
spread is called metastatic cancer. Stage 4
means there is metastatic cancer at diagnosis.
If the pancreatic protocol did not show distant
spread, you may undergo more imaging:

As a 22-year survivor of
pancreatic cancer, I can say
from experience that if you
have received a diagnosis
that seemingly gives you
little hope, the doctors may
be expressing their own
limitations. Hard-fought
scientific breakthroughs
administered through the
healing hands and hearts
of untold doctors, nurses,
scientists and technicians
make increasingly common,
though still miraculous,
outcomes possible. You need
only seek them out."

Positron emission tomography combined
with CT (called a PET/CT scan) is not a
routine test but may be helpful for some
people

A PET scan highlights tissue in your body that
may be cancerous. About an hour before the
scan, you will be injected with a radioactive
substance called a tracer. Cancer cells take in
more of the tracer than normal cells and show
up as bright spots on the scan. The tracer will
pass out of your body in your urine.

A diagnostic radiologist is a doctor
who’s an expert in identifying health
conditions through imaging. This
doctor will review your scans, write a
report, and discuss the findings with
the multidisciplinary team.

Tests for pancreatic cancer » Endoscopic tests

Endoscopic tests

areas of cancer growth and may obtain tissue
samples for testing.

An endoscope is a medical device that
allows doctors to see and work inside the
body. It causes less trauma to the body than
open surgery. Your care team will decide if
endoscopic staging is needed, though this is
not commonly done.

Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is
mostly used to treat health conditions, such
as a blocked bile duct. It may be used to look
for areas of cancer growth. ERCP used for
supportive care is described in Chapter 3.

An endoscope is a device with a long, flexible
tube. The endoscopist will guide the tube into
your body. At the tip of the device is a light,
a camera, and sometimes other tools. The
endoscopist will view the images on a screen.

A laparoscopy may be done if your care team
suspects metastatic cancer but none was seen
with imaging. First, your care team will give
you general anesthesia to put you in a sleeplike state. Next, a surgeon will make small
cuts in your abdomen. Through the cuts, gas
will be pumped into your inner abdomen for a
better view and a laparoscope will be inserted.
Endoscopes designed for laparoscopy are
referred to as laparoscopes. The surgeon will
look for signs of cancer outside the pancreas.

An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may
be done to confirm where the pancreatic
tumor has grown. An endoscope tube will be
inserted into your mouth and guided down
to the first part of the small intestine called
the duodenum. The ultrasound probe on the
endoscope makes images of the pancreas
and nearby structures. Your doctor will look for

Endoscopic ultrasound
For some people, an endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) may help stage
pancreatic cancer. EUS can show
where the tumor has grown in and
around the pancreas. You will need
to fast since the endoscope (shown)
will be guided through your mouth
down to your stomach. You will be
given medicine to help you relax
or sleep during the procedure. The
scope may be fitted with a hollow
needle to collect biopsy samples.

cancer spread to the liver. A CT scan or
ultrasound will be used to guide the needle to
the right spot. Imaging-guided biopsy is
the preferred method to remove small pieces
of tumor.

Biopsy
A biopsy is a procedure that removes tissue
or fluid samples from the body. Samples are
sent to a lab and examined by a pathologist
for cancer cells. This is the only way to confirm
(diagnose) cancer.

A second biopsy may be needed
If no cancer cells are found, a second biopsy
will likely be done if your care team believes
there is cancer. Tissue from another area may
be removed or a different type of biopsy may
be done. You might need to go to a cancer
center that treats many people with pancreatic
cancer.

Not everyone needs a biopsy before treatment.
If you have surgery first, the diagnosis may be
confirmed on the day of surgery to spare you
from having another complex procedure. On
the other hand, a biopsy is needed to confirm
the diagnosis before drug treatment, such as
chemotherapy.

A pathologist is a doctor who’s an

and diagnosing cancer. This doctor
records the results of lab tests used
for diagnosis in a pathology report.
Ask your care team for a copy of the
report and to review the results with
you. Take notes and ask questions.

A biopsy for pancreatic cancer is often done
with a needle. This is called a needle biopsy.
The preferred method of performing a needle
biopsy is with EUS. An EUS-guided biopsy
obtains better samples and has less serious
risks than other biopsies. If you undergo
ERCP, the EUS-guided biopsy can be done
before the stent is placed.
Another method of performing a needle biopsy
is to go through the skin. This method is
usually done if your team suspects pancreatic

Tests for pancreatic cancer » Blood tests

Blood tests

CA 19-9 marker

If metastatic cancer was not detected with
imaging, two types of blood tests will be done
to help with cancer staging. Blood samples will
be removed by a needle placed into your vein.
Blocked bile ducts can affect test results, so
blood samples must be drawn only when your
bile ducts are clear. A symptom of blocked
ducts is jaundice.

Pancreatic cancer cells make a protein called
carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9). High
CA 19-9 levels in blood are a tumor marker of
pancreatic cancer; however, CA 19-9 can’t be
used alone for diagnosis for two reasons:




Liver function tests
Liver function tests measure levels of proteins
and enzymes made or processed by the liver.
They also measure a chemical called bilirubin
that makes bile yellow. Abnormal levels
may be caused by pancreatic cancer that is
blocking bile ducts or is in the liver.

Some people with pancreatic cancer have
normal levels of CA 19-9.

When caused by pancreatic cancer, high CA
19-9 levels often mean a high cancer stage.
Your care team will take CA 19-9 levels into
account when planning treatment. This test
may be repeated after treatment to check if
levels are dropping or rising.

Liver function tests
The liver is the largest organ and
sits below the right rib cage and
above the pancreas. Liver function
tests measure substances made
or processed by the liver. Tumors
in the head of the pancreas may
block the common bile duct,
which can cause high test results.
Pancreatic cancer that has spread
to the liver may also affect test
results.

High levels can be caused by other health
conditions, including a blocked bile duct.

Tests for pancreatic cancer » Genetic tests for inherited mutations

Genetic tests for inherited
mutations

Genetic tests are used to look for germline
mutations. All people with pancreatic
cancer should get genetic tests, which
are used for treatment planning. Either a
sample of blood or spit (saliva) is tested. For a
list of germline mutations related to pancreatic
cancer, see Guide 2.

Some people with pancreatic cancer inherited
a risk for the cancer from a birth parent. In
these cases, the cancer is called hereditary
pancreatic cancer. The cancer risk was passed
down through abnormal genes called germline
mutations. Genes tell cells how to build your
body and make it work. Germline mutations
are in every cell of the body that has DNA.

Genetic tests look for but will not find germline
mutations in most people with pancreatic
cancer. That’s because most people don’t
have hereditary pancreatic cancer. Also, the

Tests for pancreatic cancer » Biomarker tests for profiling

Biomarker tests for profiling

genetic cause of hereditary pancreatic cancer
is unknown in most families.

Biomarker tests look for biological clues, or
markers, of cancer that differ between people.
Such clues can help with diagnosis, such
as the CA 19-9 marker, and with treatment.
Biomarker testing is not the same as genetic
testing that assesses what a person inherited
from their birth parents.

Talking to a genetic counselor may be helpful
for people with pancreatic cancer who have
either a:

Cancer-causing germline mutation or
Family history of cancer, especially
pancreatic cancer.

Not all pancreatic cancers are the same.
Biomarker tests for pancreatic cancer provide
a molecular profile—small yet important
features—of the cancer. They detect abnormal
changes in cancer cells' genes that occurred
during your lifetime. Some of these acquired
changes are listed in Guide 3.

Genetic counselors can help explain what the
results of genetic tests mean. You may learn
that you have a hereditary health condition.
You and your counselor can discuss sharing
your test results with your family.
Genetic testing is helpful for treatment planning.
Some types of treatment work well for certain
inherited mutations. An example is the drug
olaparib (Lynparza) used to treat pancreatic
cancer with germline BRCA mutations.

Genes and cancer
Genes are small segments of
DNA that tell cells how to build
your body and make it work.
Some people are born with
inherited changes in genes
called germline mutations.
Abnormal genes can develop
during a lifetime, including
gene mutations, fusions, and
amplifications. Experts have
developed treatments for
some of the abnormal genes
that promote the growth of
pancreatic cancer.

Tests for pancreatic cancer » Biomarker tests for profiling

At this time, molecular biomarker tests are
done only on advanced and metastatic
pancreatic cancer. A sample of the tumor is
preferred for testing. Since fragments of DNA
from cancer cells are in blood, a blood sample
is also an option for some people.

Because of molecular biomarkers, a treatment
that helps one person might not help you.
Examples of treatment based on molecular
biomarkers are listed in Guide 3. Who may
receive these treatments and at what timepoint

A highly experienced team of experts
should manage your care if pancreatic
cancer is suspected or diagnosed. They
will decide what treatments are options
for you.

We want your
feedback!

When pancreatic cancer is suspected,
a CT or MRI scan done according to
a pancreatic protocol can best show if
there is a mass and where it has grown.
Additional imaging and endoscopic tests
may be done to help stage the cancer.

Our goal is to provide helpful and
easy-to-understand information
on cancer.

Liver function tests and a CA 19-9 test are
needed for treatment planning.

Take our survey to let us know
what we got right and what we
could do better.

A biopsy to collect cell samples for cancer
testing is needed before starting medical
treatment, such as chemotherapy. If
surgery will be your first treatment, a
biopsy sample can be collected on the
day of surgery.

NCCN.org/patients/feedback

After diagnosis, genetic tests will be done
to assess if you have an inherited risk of
pancreatic cancer.
Biomarker tests provide a molecular
profile of the cancer. There are treatments
for some markers.

Blocked bile duct

Supportive care is cancer care
that improves your quality of life.

A bile duct is a small tube-shaped structure
that drains fluid called bile from the liver. The
common bile duct runs through the head of the
pancreas where most pancreatic tumors grow.
Pancreatic tumors often grow large enough to
block a bile duct.

One of its main goals is to relieve
symptoms caused by cancer or
its treatment. Supportive care for
people with pancreatic cancer

A blocked bile duct can cause a range of
symptoms. You may have pain or a fever.
Stools (poop) may be lighter in color and
float. Urine (pee) may be dark. Your eyes and
skin may have a yellow tint called jaundice.
Jaundice of the skin may cause itchiness.

should be started as soon as
possible.

There are three ways to treat a blocked duct:

About supportive care



Supportive care is a key part of treatment for
everyone with pancreatic cancer. It is not just
for people at the end of life who need hospice.
Many people with pancreatic cancer need
relief from symptoms starting at diagnosis.
Supportive care is sometimes called palliative
care since symptom relief is a main goal.
But supportive care addresses many other
needs. You can get help with making treatment
decisions and coordination of care between
health providers. You can get emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling.





This chapter describes some of the unique
needs of people with pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic cancer and its treatment often
cause poor nutrition and other health issues.
This chapter also lists NCCN resources on
supportive care. Tell your care team about your
symptoms and other needs to get the best
supportive care for you.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pancreatic Cancer, 2023

The most common is placement of
a small, expandable tube, called
a stent, in the bile duct during a
procedure called endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
Stenting will not be performed if you’ll be
having pancreatic surgery soon.
Bile can be drained from the duct through
a long, soft tube, called a catheter, to a
bag outside your body then possibly later
into your intestine.
A surgery called a biliary bypass can be
performed, which connects the small
intestine to the common bile duct above
the pancreas.

The preferred method to unblock a bile duct
is a stent inserted during ERCP. In general,
metal stents should be used instead of plastic
stents. Sometimes it is not possible to place a
metal stent right away, and a plastic stent will
be used first.
Stents that are completely covered in material
can be removed. Partially covered or bare

22

Supportive care » Blocked stomach

metal stents should be used if pancreatic
cancer has been confirmed by a pathologist.



Blocked stomach

In addition to a gastrojejunostomy, you may
receive a feeding tube. A PEG tube can be
used as a feeding tube. A jejunostomy tube
(J-tube) is also a feeding tube that is inserted
through the skin into the small intestine.

A pancreatic tumor may grow large enough
to block food from leaving your stomach. The
blockage may be where the stomach empties
into the small intestine called the gastric
outlet or pylorus. Blockages may also occur
in the first part of the small intestine called the
duodenum. These blockages can cause pain,
vomiting, and weight loss. Treatments for a
blocked stomach include:

An endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
may be used to open a blocked bile
duct. The endoscopist will guide an
endoscope tube down your throat to
the small intestine. An x-ray video
will show the endoscope moving
inside your body. Next, the doctor
will insert a stent into the blocked
duct.

Pancreatic insufficiency and
diabetes



The pancreas makes two types of chemicals—
enzymes and hormones. The enzymes break
down proteins, fats, sugars, and starches in
food. The hormones control blood sugar levels.
People with pancreatic cancer may have
abnormal levels of these chemicals.





Low pancreatic enzymes

Unrelated to cancer, the pancreas doesn’t
produce more insulin to unlock cells that
are resistant to it (type 2 diabetes)
Pancreatic cancer may stop pancreatic
cells from making hormones (type 3c
diabetes)
Surgery that removes part of or your
entire pancreas will reduce the amount of
hormones made by your pancreas (type
3c diabetes)

Pancreatic cancer or its treatment may cause
the pancreas to make fewer enzymes. This is
called exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).
Many people have EPI after surgery that
removes pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer can change how diabetes
is managed. Ask your care team what the best
treatment is for you. Each type of diabetes is
different and treated differently.

You may have trouble digesting food without
enough pancreatic enzymes. Symptoms
include stomach cramps, gas, weight loss, and
lack of proper nutrition. Stools (poop) may be
especially smelly, light in color, and float.

Pain
Most people with advanced pancreatic cancer
have cancer-related pain. A large tumor can
cause pain by pressing on nearby organs.
Pancreatic cancer can also spread to nearby
nerves and cause severe pain. Pain is most
often felt in the belly area (abdomen) or the
middle of the back.

Pancreatic enzyme replacement gives you the
digestive enzymes you lack. You will need to
take several capsules while you eat. The dose
differs between people, so your care team
will give you specific instructions. If the cost
of enzyme replacement is high, ask your care
team about how to obtain financial help.

There are many ways to manage pain. Your
care team will develop a plan that works
best for you. Working with a palliative care
specialist or a pain specialist soon after the
cancer diagnosis may be helpful. Pain from
pancreatic cancer may be managed with:

Low pancreatic hormones
Insulin and glucagon are pancreatic hormones
that control blood sugar levels. People with
pancreatic cancer may not have enough of
these hormones. The result may be abnormal
levels of blood sugar.

A palliative care specialist
has received specific training
to provide additional support
to you. Their care focuses
on relieving symptoms and
reducing stress. A palliative
care specialist may be a
doctor, nurse, or other type of
care provider. Some cancer
centers have palliative care

Supportive care » Blood clots and bleeding

Blood clots and bleeding

or thrombi if referring to more than one. Loose
blood clots that travel in the bloodstream are
called emboli.

Pancreatic cancer can cause blood to thicken
and form blood clots. A blood clot is a gel-like
clump of blood. Pancreatic cancer may also
cause bleeding in the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract. Your care team will be on the lookout for
symptoms related to these effects of cancer.

Thromboembolic disease

Pancreatic cancer increases the chance of
getting blood clots (thromboembolic disease).
As blood clots worsen, they can block enough
blood flow to cause symptoms. Untreated
blood clots may cause long-term problems or
be deadly.

Normally, blood clots develop to stop bleeding
and then dissolve. But a blood clot can
form inside a blood vessel when there is no
bleeding. This type of clot is called a thrombus

Many blood clots are safely treated
with medication called anticoagulants.
Anticoagulants are often called blood thinners,
though they do not thin the blood. Rather, they

easily or get nose bleeds when taking
anticoagulants. Your doctor may ask you
to stop taking aspirin while you’re on an
anticoagulant.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) –
This medicine enhances the effect of a
natural anticoagulant in your body. It is
injected into the skin and can be taken at
home.

Bleeding in the GI tract
GI bleeding may occur due to cancer-related
ulcers or high blood pressure in the liver
vein. If bleeding happens, you may have
bloody stools or vomit blood. There are three
treatments for bleeding:

Vitamin K blockers – Among these
medicines, warfarin (Coumadin,
Jantoven) is most often used. It is a pill
taken at home. Warfarin stops the liver
from using vitamin K, which is needed to
make clotting proteins. LMWH is preferred
over warfarin for treatment.




Direct oral anticoagulants – These pills
disable proteins that help the blood to
clot. A direct oral anticoagulant may
be used if the pancreatic tumor is not
growing inside the stomach or intestine.

Anticoagulants increase the risk of bleeding
due to slow clotting time. The risk is even

As a former caregiver, the best advice I can give is: don’t give up.
Don’t give up hope, don’t give up on the tasks that lie ahead, and
don’t give up on yourself or your loved one. Whether you have been
a caregiver for months or years, you know there is a heaviness to it
at times; some days feel like an uphill battle. However, what you are
doing matters, every moment. Caregiving for my mom in her final
years is an experience that I wouldn’t trade for anything. But during
those years, I still had to remind myself every day to not give up. It’s
easier said than done, but I encourage anyone caregiving today to try
and do the same."

The library of NCCN Guidelines for Patients
has books on supportive care. These books
focus on common physical and emotional
effects of many cancers and their treatment.
NCCN has books for:

Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are
cancer treatments that have been around for a
long time. Chemotherapy causes side effects
because it kills fast-growing normal cells
as well as cancer cells. Likewise, radiation
therapy may cause side effects by affecting
fast-growing normal cells within the radiation
beams.

Distress
Everyone with cancer feels distress at some
point. It is normal to be worried, sad, helpless,
or angry. Distress can become severe and
affect the way you live. Read about managing
distress at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Nausea and vomiting
Both chemotherapy and radiation therapy can
cause nausea and vomiting. Nausea is the
feeling that you are going to throw up. Vomiting
is forcefully throwing up what’s in your
stomach. Learn how to prevent and manage
nausea and vomiting at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Immunotherapy side effects
Immunotherapy is a newer cancer treatment
that is used for some pancreatic cancers.
A type of immunotherapy called immune
checkpoint inhibitors may cause your immune
cells to attack your healthy cells. Immunerelated side effects can occur during or after
treatment. Read about immune-related side
effects at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pancreatic Cancer, 2023

Anemia and neutropenia
Chemotherapy often causes a drop in red and
white blood cells. You are more likely to get
infections when white blood cells counts are
low (neutropenia). A low number of red blood
cells (anemia) may cause severe tiredness

28

Supportive care » Advance care planning

Advance care planning

called fatigue. Learn about treatments
for low blood cell counts at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

When diagnosed with cancer, it may be time
to consider what lies ahead. The pursuit of
identifying what health care is important to you
is called advance care planning. Advance care
planning is for everyone, not just for those who
are very sick.

Late and long-term effects
Cancer and its treatment can cause long-term
and late effects. Long-term effects start during
treatment and persist after treatment is done.
Less often, effects start long after treatment
has ended. Late and long-term effects include
fatigue, poor sleep, pain, and depression.
Read about treatment for these effects at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Advance care planning involves making
medical decisions now in case you become
unable to do so. It’s about making sure that
your wishes are understood and respected.
You should get the care you want and prevent
care that you don’t want. Making an advance
care plan now will lessen future stress.
The planning process starts with a candid
talk with your care team. Ask about the likely
course of the cancer, which is called the
prognosis. Having a general idea will help
with planning. Learn what care options relieve
symptoms and will give you the best quality of
life. Invite close family and friends to take part
in your advance care planning. They should
know your wishes.
When you’re ready to make decisions, you’ll fill
out a legal document that explains your wishes
for health care. This document is called an
advance directive. Health care providers follow
an advance directive when you can’t make
your wishes known.
Give a copy of your advance directive to your
care team. Also give a copy to anyone you’ve
authorized to make decisions on your behalf.
You can change your advance care plan at
any time. Frequent conversations with your
care team can help. If you make changes, give
everyone the new advance directive.

are and how they can help you.

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

About clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in a
laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer
need to be studied in people. If found to be safe
and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device,
or treatment approach may be approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Phases of clinical trials
Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety, and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for early
signs that the drug or approach is helpful.
Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo

a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.



Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.

Surgery may be an option if tests don’t find
clear signs of distant cancer spread. Distant
spread is called metastases or stage 4. If
the cancer is not stage 4, your care team will
decide if surgery is an option. They will discuss
your health history and test results, such as
the CA 19-9 tumor marker and imaging. The
team will look at two key factors:

some cancer treatments may cause serious
health problems.

In recent years, more local cancers have
been treated with surgery due to advances
in medicine. Improved imaging shows more
clearly where the cancer has grown. Newer
surgical approaches can remove cancer that
couldn’t be removed before. Treatment that
shrinks the cancer may make surgery possible.

The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) Performance Status is a common
scoring system. It consists of five scores
ranging from 0 to 4. Lower scores represent a
better ability to do self-care.

NCCN keeps track of medical advances and
updates the criteria for surgery. Currently,
surgery is based on how much the cancer
has grown to nearby blood vessels and which
blood vessels are involved.

Cancer growth to blood vessels
The goals of surgery are to safely remove
all the cancer to prolong life and to improve
quality of life. These goals may be reached
if the cancer hasn’t grown much outside the
pancreas. Larger pancreatic cancers are
harder or impossible to remove. Most often,
local pancreatic cancer can’t be removed
because of major growth to nearby blood
vessels.

Based on this information, pancreatic cancers
are divided into three surgery groups:


Major blood vessels near
the pancreas
There are several major
blood vessels near the
pancreas (shown). Treatment
of pancreatic cancer with
surgery is based on cancer
growth to nearby blood
vessels. Arteries carry
blood away from the heart,
and veins return blood to
the heart. Surgery is more
often done when the cancer
has no contact with blood
vessels.

Borderline resectable means that it
would be hard to safely remove all the
cancer, so treatment to shrink the cancer
should be received first.

See Guide 4 to learn about the criteria for
the three surgery groups.

Locally advanced means that the
cancer can’t be removed or the blood

Guide 4
Criteria for deciding if pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery

Resectable

A surgeon can remove the cancer because:
• There is no contact with nearby major veins and arteries or
• The cancer has limited contact with the superior mesenteric vein
or portal vein that doesn’t alter the vessel’s shape

Borderline resectable

A surgeon would have a hard time safely removing all the cancer due
to limited growth to blood vessels, such as in the following instances:
• Cancer in the head of the pancreas has grown to only the common
hepatic artery, wraps less than halfway around the superior
mesenteric artery, or has grown to a small artery that branches off
a larger artery in an unusual spot
• Cancer in the body or tail of the pancreas wraps less than halfway
around the celiac artery
• The cancer has grown to the superior mesenteric vein or portal
vein and the vein can be repaired
• The cancer has grown to the inferior vena cava

Locally advanced

A surgeon can’t remove the cancer because of major growth to blood
vessels:
• The cancer wraps more than halfway around the superior
mesenteric artery or celiac artery
• Cancer in the body or tail of the pancreas has grown to the celiac
artery or aorta
• The superior mesenteric vein or portal vein cannot be repaired due
to cancer growth or blockage of the vein

cancers.
Chemotherapy is used for neoadjuvant
therapy. Chemoradiation after chemotherapy is
sometimes part of treatment. See Guide 5
for neoadjuvant therapy options.

Neoadjuvant therapy is cancer treatment that's
given before the main treatment, in this case,
surgery. Borderline resectable pancreatic
cancer must first be treated with neoadjuvant
therapy to reduce its size for surgery.
Resectable cancer may first be treated with
surgery, but neoadjuvant therapy before

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells like
cancer. It is given as a slow drip or injection

Guide 5
Neoadjuvant therapy of pancreatic cancer
Neoadjuvant therapy may shrink cancer and have other benefits. NCCN recommends that
neoadjuvant treatment be received at or managed by a high-volume center. Ask your care team if
there is a clinical trial on neoadjuvant therapy that’s a good fit for you.

Option 1:
FOLFIRINOX
with or without
chemoradiation

FOLFIRINOX is an intense chemotherapy used to treat people
with a performance score of 0 or 1. It may shrink the pancreatic
tumor, especially if there is a BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 mutation.
FOLFIRINOX is a short name for these cancer drugs:
• FOL = leucovorin
• F = fluorouracil (also called 5-FU)
• IRI = irinotecan
• OX = oxaliplatin
The modified FOLFIRINOX regimen may be received. This regimen
includes only a slow drip of 5-FU and not the faster injection.
Chemoradiation may be received after chemotherapy.

Option 2:
Gemcitabine
combination
with or without
chemoradiation

Gemcitabine is used with another chemotherapy for better results. The
gemcitabine combination used for most pancreatic cancers is:
• Gemcitabine plus albumin-bound paclitaxel
Since platinum chemotherapy works better for pancreatic cancers with
BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 mutations, the option for these cancers is:
• Gemcitabine plus cisplatin
Chemoradiation may be received after chemotherapy.

hard-to-reach places. Research on which
chemotherapy drugs work best for neoadjuvant
therapy is ongoing.

Possible benefits of
neoadjuvant therapy
There are several promising reasons
to have neoadjuvant therapy, but more
research is needed. Your care team
may recommend neoadjuvant therapy
because:

Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment
days followed by days of rest. The cycles vary
in length depending on which drugs are used.
Chemotherapy is usually given for up to 6
months.

you will have and how many days of treatment
there are within a cycle. Also ask about health

Surgery will be scheduled if there’s a good

There must be no clear signs of distant
metastases. Your surgeon must see a way to
remove the tumor with enough normal-looking

margin. The goal is to have no cancer cells in
the margin, so a cure is likely. Treatment used
to cure cancer is called definitive therapy.

Experience is important

Types of surgery

Pancreatic surgery is complex. It is a long
surgery with multiple steps. Here’s a few
examples of what happens during surgery:






The type of surgery you will have depends on
where the tumor is in the pancreas.
A tumor in the pancreas head is treated
with a pancreaticoduodenectomy (also called
a Whipple procedure). This surgery removes
these body parts:

Right before surgery, you will be given
general anesthesia. These drugs will put
you in a sleep-like state, so you won’t feel
pain. One or more cuts called incisions
will be made in your abdomen.



Organs will be detached from other
tissues, so they can be moved. This is
called mobilization. Often, the common
bile duct and blood vessels are tied off
(ligated). Many structures will be divided
to remove the tumor.

Gallbladder



Nearby lymph nodes
At times, some of the stomach and parts
of blood vessels

A classic Whipple procedure removes part
of the stomach, but a pylorus-preserving
procedure does not.
Reconstruction starts with attaching the
pancreas and bile duct to the mid-small
intestine called the jejunum. Then either the
stomach or duodenum is attached farther
down on the jejunum. Blood vessels may need
reconstruction.

You want an experienced surgeon to do this
complex surgery. Choose a care center that
does at least 15 to 20 pancreatic cancer
surgeries every year. This is considered a
high-volume center.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pancreatic Cancer, 2023





After removing the tumor, your surgeon
will rebuild cut tissues. This is called
reconstruction. New connections between
body parts will be made (anastomoses).
Sometimes, blood vessels will be repaired
with vessels from other areas of the body
(grafts).

Some of the pancreas, common bile duct,
and small intestine

A tumor in the pancreas body or tail
is treated with a distal pancreatectomy and
splenectomy. A distal pancreatectomy removes

the body and tail of the pancreas, and a
splenectomy removes the entire spleen. The
left adrenal gland might also be removed.



Nearby lymph nodes



At times, parts of blood vessels

Reconstruction involves attaching the bile duct
and stomach to the jejunum. Blood vessels
may need reconstruction.

A tumor in the pancreas neck may be
treated with either a Whipple procedure, distal
pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy.
An extended Whipple procedure and
extended distal pancreatectomy remove
more tissue than standard surgeries. A total
pancreatectomy removes these body parts:




Methods of surgery
Pancreatic surgery is done with one of two
methods.

Pancreas, spleen, and gallbladder

The classic method is called open surgery
or laparotomy. Your surgeon will remove tissue
through one large cut in the middle of your
body. The cut starts between the ribs and

extends down to the belly button. Through
the cut, your surgeon can see and access the
pancreatic tumor.

Sometimes pancreatic surgeries are not
completed. Your surgeon will explore your
inner abdomen to see if the cancer has
spread far. Metastatic cancer may not be
seen in imaging scans but then will be found
during surgery. If metastatic cancer is found,
pancreatic surgery should not be done.

The newer method is called minimally
invasive surgery or laparoscopic
surgery. Your surgeon will use surgical
tools inserted through several small cuts
made in your abdomen. One of the tools is a
laparoscope, which has a small video camera.
The video of your inner abdomen will be
displayed on a screen.

Pancreatic surgeries are also not completed
if the tumor can’t be safely removed. Your
surgeon has a better view of the tumor during
surgery. They may see that the tumor has
grown so much around blood vessels that it
can’t be removed.

Your surgeon may perform laparoscopic
surgery using robotic arms to control the
surgical tools. This is called robot-assisted
laparoscopic surgery.

If pancreatic surgery isn’t completed, your
surgeon may perform other procedures while
you’re still under anesthesia:

Side effects of surgery
Common side effects of surgery are pain,
swelling, and scars. Pain and swelling
often fade away in the weeks after surgery.
Numbness near the surgical area may be longlasting. There is a chance of infection. If part of
your pancreas remains, it may leak digestive
enzymes. An opening between the pancreas
and other organs, called fistulas, may develop.





Celiac plexus neurolysis is an injection of
a nerve block into a nerve bundle called
the celiac plexus to reduce pain
Gastrojejunostomy is a surgery that
connects the bottom of the stomach to the
jejunum so that food doesn’t get blocked
by the tumor
A biliary bypass is a surgery that connects
the small intestine to the common bile
duct above the pancreas to treat jaundice
Instead of a bypass, placement a small,
metal, expandable tube (stent) into the
bile duct may be done to treat jaundice

When surgery isn’t completed, the cancer will
be treated by other methods to try to control
its growth. Read Chapter 6 to learn about

they couldn’t be seen.

Adjuvant therapy can start when you’ve
recovered enough from surgery. It’s ideal
to start within 12 weeks after surgery. See
Guide 6 for adjuvant therapy options based
on whether you had neoadjuvant therapy or
did not receive it.

Follow-up care
While pancreatic cancer can sometimes be
cured, it is very important to monitor the return
of the cancer. The return of cancer is called a
recurrence. Routine testing for a recurrence is
called surveillance.

Chemoradiation
Radiation therapy combined
with chemotherapy is called
chemoradiation. It may be part of
neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.
During radiation therapy, you will
lie on a table during treatment

your movement will be used. To
spare normal tissue from radiation,
intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) or three-dimensional
conformal radiation therapy
(3D-CRT) should be used.

Radiation therapy
For a recurrence near to where the tumor

Pancreatic surgery can be performed by
one of two methods. During open surgery,
body tissue is removed through one
large cut. Minimally invasive surgery is
performed through several small cuts.
If your surgeon is unable to remove the
tumor, procedures to prevent or relieve
symptoms may be done instead.
After pancreatic surgery, you may receive
more treatment to kill any cancer cells
that remain in your body. Chemotherapy

Treatment without surgery » Tests during treatment

Tests during treatment

chemotherapy regimens used for first-line
therapy.

During cancer treatment you will get tests
so your care team can assess if treatment is
working.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
kill or damage pancreatic cancer cells. The
most common method is called external beam
radiation therapy (EBRT). EBRT involves a
large machine that makes radiation beams.
Modern machines precisely target tumors.



A radiation oncologist is an expert in treating
cancer with radiation. They will lead a team
that designs your treatment plan and gives
radiation therapy.



Locally advanced cancer may be treated with
EBRT called stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT). SBRT is very precise,
delivers high doses each session, and is
finished in 5 or fewer sessions. If you undergo
chemotherapy, you may have SBRT afterward.
If chemotherapy isn’t an option for you, SBRT
by itself may be used for treatment.



Your care team will also look at other
signs of health. A team member will ask if
you’re having symptoms and check your
performance status. A CA 19-9 test will be
done.
If the cancer is locally advanced, you may
have a laparoscopy to look for metastases
before surgery, chemoradiation, or SBRT.

During first-line therapy, the cancer may have
gotten smaller, stayed the same, or grew more.
Based on the results of treatment, your care
team will provide you with treatment options.

Palliative radiation therapy may be part of
supportive care. It can help relieve pain and
stop bleeding. It may shrink the tumor so that it
is not blocking other body structures.

No signs of cancer growth

Chemoradiation

If locally advanced cancer did not grow
during treatment and your performance status
is 0, 1, or 2, options are:

Chemoradiation is treatment with both
chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Locally advanced cancer that is treated with
chemotherapy for 4 to 6 months may later be
treated with chemoradiation.



For chemoradiation, radiation sessions
occur on weekdays for about 5 to 6 weeks.
During these weeks, you will also receive
chemotherapy. Preferred regimens are
capecitabine and 5-FU. Another option is
gemcitabine.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pancreatic Cancer, 2023

You will have a series of imaging scans.
Imaging may be done with computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). Contrast is needed. If
surgery becomes an option for locally
advanced cancer, a pancreatic protocol
should be followed as explained in
Chapter 2.

Maintenance therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer
The goal of maintenance therapy is to extend the time until the cancer worsens. Treatment options
are based on the regimen you had.

If you had
FOLFIRINOX

There are 7 options:
• Olaparib for people with inherited BCRA1 or BCRA2 mutation
(preferred)
• Clinical trial
• Capecitabine
• Fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin
• 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI)
• 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)
• Rucaparib for people with inherited or acquired BCRA1, BCRA2,
or PALB2 mutation

If you had a regimen
with cisplatin or
oxaliplatin

There are 3 options:
• Olaparib for people with inherited BCRA1 or BCRA2 mutation
(preferred)
• Clinical trial
• Rucaparib for people with inherited or acquired BCRA1, BCRA2,
or PALB2 mutation

If you had gemcitabine
and albumin-bound
paclitaxel

There are 3 options:
• Clinical trial
• Gemcitabine plus albumin-bound paclitaxel modified schedule
• Gemcitabine

Treatment without surgery » Second-line therapy

Second-line therapy



Pancreatic cancer may be treated with multiple
lines of therapy. Second-line therapy is the
second treatment used for cancer care. If
more lines of therapy are needed, the options
mentioned in this section may be tried.

Systemic therapy

Care options

There are many options for second-line
systemic therapy. Some first-line regimens are
also options for second-line therapy, and there
are new options, too. See Guide 12 for a
complete list.

If cancer treatment is an option, your care
team will suggest a different treatment than
used for first-line therapy and continue to
provide supportive care.






Second-line regimens consist of targeted
therapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy.
Biomarker tests are needed to know if
you may benefit from targeted therapy or
immunotherapy.

Treatment within a clinical trial is
preferred. In a clinical trial, you’ll receive
standard treatment or a new cancer drug.
In addition to clinical trials, standard
systemic therapy is an option.
Locally advanced cancer may be treated
with chemoradiation or SBRT if you
haven’t had radiation therapy before.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy for pancreatic
cancer is often a liquid that
is injected into a vein. Some
injections are done in the arm
or hand while others are done
though an implanted device
called a port. An infusion is
a slow drip controlled by a
pump that may take hours. A
continuous infusion may last
for days. A bolus and a push are
faster injections.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pancreatic Cancer, 2023

If cancer treatment would be too
harsh on your body, supportive care
is recommended. Your care team may
prescribe radiation therapy or singleagent chemotherapy to relieve symptoms.





Adagrasib (Krazati) and sotorasib
(Lumakras), both of which stop KRAS
growth signals
Selpercatinib (Retevmo), which stops
RET signals



Dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli)

Chemotherapy is usually switched from one
type to another:






Regimens with fluoropyrimidine (5-FU,
capecitabine) are used after regimens
with gemcitabine



Regimens with gemcitabine are used after
fluoropyrimidine-based therapy

One exception is the 5-FU, leucovorin, and
liposomal irinotecan regimen. This may be an
option even if you had 5-FU before, but you
must not have already had irinotecan.



Health visits
During second-line therapy, you’ll continue
to have imaging scans to watch for cancer
growth. Your care team will ask about cancer
symptoms at health visits. It’s also important
that they ask how you’re feeling. It’s common
to feel anger, regret, despair, and uncertainty—
even all at the same time. Share your feelings
with your care team. They can connect you
with resources during this challenging time.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Pancreatic Cancer, 2023

For most people with pancreatic cancer,
surgery is not the best treatment. Wholebody treatment with cancer drugs, called
systemic therapy, is most often used to
treat advanced and metastatic pancreatic
cancer.
Treatment options are based on your
ability to do daily activities called
performance status.
Everyone should have supportive care. It
improves quality of life. It can help relieve
symptoms as well as help with mental,
social, and spiritual issues.
If cancer treatment is an option, receiving
treatment in a clinical trial is preferred.
If you don’t enroll in a clinical trial, the
cancer will likely be treated with approved
systemic therapy. Options include a range
of chemotherapy regimens, and possibly
targeted therapy or immunotherapy based
on biomarker tests. Chemoradiation or
SBRT is a third option if the cancer hasn’t
spread far.
If cancer treatment would be too harsh
on your body, cancer care will consist of
supportive care. You may have systemic
therapy or radiation therapy to relieve
symptoms.
Your care team will look for signs of
cancer growth during treatment. When
cancer grows, your care team will provide
you with options.
Tell your care team about any challenges
you are having so they can connect you
to helpful resources.

Making treatment decisions » It’s your choice

It is important to be comfortable

If you take the time to build a relationship with
your team, it will help you feel supported when
considering options and making treatment
decisions.

with the cancer treatment you
choose. This choice starts with
having an open and honest

Second opinion

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer should not be
ignored, there is time to have another cancer
care provider review your test results and
suggest a treatment plan. This is called getting
a second opinion, and it’s a normal part of
cancer care. Even doctors get second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your team.

Things you can do to prepare:


Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments



Your feelings about pain or side effects






Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work
Quality of life and length of life

Questions to ask

How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Possible questions to ask your cancer care
team are listed on the following pages. Feel
free to use these or come up with your own.
Be clear about your goals for treatment and
find out what to expect from treatment.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.

Pancreatic Cancer, 2023

Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.
