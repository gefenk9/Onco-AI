Basal cell basics

Skin basics﻿
basics

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most
common skin cancer. Exposure to
ultraviolet (UV) light causes changes
that increase your risk of developing
skin cancer. This chapter will provide an
overview of basal cell skin cancer.

There are 3 main types of cells in the
epidermis:


Squamous cells: These cells are flat
cells found in the upper part of the
epidermis.



Basal cells: These cells are found in the
lower part of the epidermis, called the
basal cell layer. Basal cells constantly
divide to form new cells to replace the
squamous cells that wear off of the skin’s
surface. As these cells move up in the
epidermis, they get flatter, eventually
becoming squamous cells.



Melanocytes: These cells are found
in the top layer of skin. Melanin is
produced in the melanocytes. Melanin
is responsible for the color of our hair,
skin, and eyes. In addition to providing
color, melanin also protects our skin from
harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.

Skin basics
Your skin is the largest organ of the body. It
covers about 20 square feet. Skin protects you
from invaders (such as microbes), helps control
body temperature, and allows the sensations of
touch, heat, and cold.
Skin has 3 layers:


Epidermis – the outermost layer of skin,
provides a waterproof barrier and creates
skin color (melanin).



Dermis – contains connective tissue, hair
follicles, and sweat glands.



Hypodermis – the deepest tissue layer, is
made up of fat and connective tissue.

For more information on melanoma or
squamous cell skin cancer, read the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients, available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines.

Skin cancers are often formed in the
epidermis. The epidermis is the top layer
of skin.

Basal cell basics

Basal cell skin cancer

Basal cell skin cancer

Basal cell skin cancer can cause a lot of
damage to your skin. It may involve areas
of soft tissue, cartilage, and bone. People
can sometimes lose part of an ear or nose.
On a positive note, basal skin cancer rarely
metastasizes. Metastasis refers to cancer
spreading from an initial site to a different or
secondary site.

Basal cell skin cancer is the most common
skin cancer. If caught early, it is easily
treatable. This is because it grows very slowly.

Causes

Basal cell skin cancer is caused by exposure
to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV radiation from
the sun or indoor tanning beds causes damage
to basal cells found in the outermost layer of
skin (epidermis). UV radiation has been found
to damage the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)
inside skin cells. DNA is the chemical in our
cells that make up our genes. DNA controls
how our cells develop, grow, and function.

Signs and symptoms

Basal cell skin cancer can appear as any of
the following:

Basal cell skin cancer usually develops on
areas exposed to the sun, including the face,
head, and neck. But, it can occur anywhere on
the body.

Skin cancers
Skin cancer is often found in the
top layer of skin. Basal cells are
found in the lower part called the
basal cell layer.

have blue, brown, or black areas



Open sores that don’t heal, or come back

Basal cell basics

Risk factors
Risk factors associated with basal cell skin
cancer include:

Sometimes people go to the doctor because
they have a sore or a cut from shaving that
just won’t heal, which turns out to be a basal
cell cancer. A simple rule of thumb is that most
shaving cuts heal within a week or so. Look
out for any new, changing or unusual skin
growths. Skin cancer is easier to treat and
cure when it is caught early.



Ultraviolet (UV) light - UV light
(radiation) that comes from the sun or
tanning beds increases your risk.



Fair skin, red or blond hair, and/or light
eye color - People with light-colored skin
are at a higher risk of developing skin
cancer. This is because melanin (skin
pigment) protects people with darker skin.



Age - Risk increases with age. This is
because sun exposure builds up over
time. However, skin cancer is becoming
more common in younger people.



Radiation therapy (RT) - Radiation for
other conditions, especially at a young
age, can cause certain cancers including
skin cancer.

Risk factors
A risk factor is anything that increases your
chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors
are passed down through genes (parent to
child), and others are caused by activities that
people do (smoking or sun exposure). Having
one or more risk factors does not mean you
will get skin cancer.

Skin lesions
Basal cell skin cancer is
often found on the face,
head, and neck. Here it is
pictured on a man’s cheek.

Basal cell basics

Staging

Staging

High-risk basal cell skin cancer is defined by
the following factors:

At the time of diagnosis, your cancer will be
classified based on certain factors. Basal cell
skin cancer is classified based on the risk
of the cancer coming back after treatment
(recurrence). Risk will be defined based on
where the tumor is located.
Risk is broken up into 3 categories:


Low risk



High risk



Regional or distant metastatic



Located on areas of the face, such as the
eyelids, nose, ears, and lips



Has previously come back after treatment



Equal to or wider than 2 centimeters

Regional or distant metastatic

Basal cell skin cancer rarely metastasizes
(spreads). However, if the tumor is not treated
it may spread. Metastatic basal cell skin
cancer is defined by whether the lesion has
spread to a distant site.

Low risk

Low-risk basal cell skin cancer means the
cancer has a low risk of coming back.
Low-risk basal cell skin cancer is defined by
the following factors:


Small and superficial (found only on top
layer of skin)



Clear, defined edge



Has not been treated before

You doctor will stage
the cancer based on
results of the tumor
biopsy. In rare cases,
you may be asked to
get imaging tests to
determine stage.

High risk

High-risk basal cell skin cancer means there
is a higher chance of the cancer coming back
after treatment.

Prevention

Prevention
While there is no proven way to prevent skin
cancer, you may be able to lower your risk.



Wear protective clothing – This includes
a wide-brimmed hat, clothes made with
UV-protective fabric, and sunglasses.



Use sunscreen – Choose a broadspectrum sunscreen with a sun protection
factor (SPF) of at least 30 and reapply
every 2 hours. Sunscreen should also be
applied 15 minutes before going outside.



Examine your skin regularly – This
includes self-examinations with the
assistance of a partner and skin exams by
a health care provider.

Speak with your health care team about
your risk.
The following preventive methods may help
reduce your risk:


Reduce UV light exposure – This
means reducing exposure to the sun and
avoiding the use of indoor tanning beds.



Prevent sun damage – Limit sun
exposure between peak hours of 10:00
AM and 4:00 PM.

Freckled skin due to
sun burn
Risk for basal cell skin cancer
is higher among those who
freckle, burn easily, or who
have very light skin, red or
blond hair, or light-colored
eyes. Pictured is freckled skin
caused by sun damage.

Early detection | Key points

Early detection

Key points

It is possible to find basal cell skin cancer
early, when it is easier to treat.



Skin protects you from invaders (such
as microbes), helps control body
temperature, and allows the sensations
of touch, heat, and cold.



Melanin is responsible for the color of
our hair, skin, and eyes. In addition to
providing color, melanin also protects our
skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.



Basal cells constantly divide to form new
cells to replace the squamous cells that
wear off the skin’s surface.

Basal cell skin cancer is caused by
exposure to UV radiation. UV radiation
from the sun or indoor tanning beds
causes damage to basal cells found in the
outermost layer of skin (epidermis).



Basal cell skin cancer usually develops on
areas exposed to the sun, including the
face, head, and neck. But, it can occur
anywhere on the body.



Look out for any new, changing, or
unusual skin growths. Skin cancer is
easier to treat and cure when it is
caught early.



Basal cell skin cancer is classified based
on the risk of the cancer coming back
after treatment (recurrence). Risk will be
defined based on where the tumor
is located.

What you can do:


Examine your skin regularly – If you
spot anything that does not look normal,
get it checked out.



See your health care provider annually
for a skin exam – Ask for a full-body
skin exam once a year. You may want to
consider a skin exam more often if you
are at higher risk for skin cancer.

Test results | General health tests

General health tests

Treatment planning starts with testing.
Accurate testing is needed to diagnose
and treat basal cell skin cancer. This
chapter presents an overview of the
tests you might receive and what
to expect.

Medical history

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Tell your doctor about any symptoms you
have. A medical history will help determine
which treatment is best for you.

Test results
Basal cell skin cancer is diagnosed based on
a complete skin exam, physical exam, biopsy,
and possible imaging studies. Your diagnosis
will determine your treatment plan. It is
important you understand what these
tests mean. Keep these things in mind:


Bring someone with you to doctor visits,
if possible.



Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.



Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.



Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on
your computer.



Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it to
your phone. Hang the list on your fridge
or keep it in a place where someone can
access it in an emergency.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Basal Cell Skin Cancer, 2022

Family history

Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your doctor will ask about the
health history of family members who are
blood relatives. This information is called a
family history. Ask family members about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed.

Bring a list of
any medications,
vitamins, over-thecounter drugs, or
herbal supplements
you take.

Testing

Skin exam

Physical exam

During a physical exam, a health care
provider may:


Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Weigh you



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat



Feel and apply pressure to parts of
your body to see if organs are of normal
size, are soft or hard, or cause pain
when touched



Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin



Conduct a complete skin exam.

Create a medical binder
A medical binder or notebook is a great
way to organize all of your records in one
place.
•

Make copies of blood tests, imaging
results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

•

Choose a binder that meets your needs.
Consider a zipper pocket to include
a pen, small calendar, and insurance
cards.

•

Create folders for insurance forms,
medical records, and tests results. You
can do the same on your computer.

•

Use online patient portals to view
your test results and other records.
Download or print the records to add to
your binder.

•

Organize your binder in a way that
works for you. Add a section for
questions and to take notes.

•

Bring your medical binder to
appointments. You never know when
you might need it!

Skin exam
It is important to find an experienced health
care provider to conduct a thorough skin
exam. Expect a head-to-toe skin exam that
includes review of the scalp, face, mouth,
hands, feet, torso and extremities, eyes and
eyelids, ears, fingers, toes, and toenails.
They will make note of any spots that need
monitoring or closer examination.
Skin is the largest organ in your body. Not only
does it protect your body, but it tells doctors a
lot about your health.

Testing

Biopsy

Biopsy

Lesion

A skin lesion is defined as an area of skin that
looks different than the surrounding area. This
can include an abnormal lump, bump, ulcer,
sore, or colored area of the skin. Most lesions
are harmless, but some may be skin cancer.
Speak to your doctor about any lesions that
have changed in color or growth.

If a concerning lesion is found on your skin,
it will be removed and sent to a lab to be
looked at under a microscope. This is called
a skin biopsy. A biopsy is needed to diagnose
basal cell skin cancer. Your sample should
be reviewed by a pathologist. The pathologist
will note the overall appearance and the size,
shape, and type of your cells.

Skin color

You know your skin better than anyone. Tell
your doctor about your normal skin color. Show
your doctor the differences in where the skin
looks normal and different to you. Describe
any changes. Risk for skin cancer is higher
among those with lighter skin color.

There are several ways to do a skin biopsy.
Your doctor will choose one based on the size
of the affected area, where it is on your body,
and other factors. Any biopsy is likely to leave
at least a small scar. Different methods can
result in different types of scars. Talk to your
doctor about the incision and the potential for
scarring before you have the biopsy.

Skin color
The lighter your skin color,
the higher risk for skin
cancer.

Testing

Biopsy
Skin punch biopsy

No matter which type of biopsy is done, it
should remove as much of the suspected area
as possible for an accurate diagnosis to be
made.

In a skin punch biopsy, a small piece of skin
and connective tissue are removed using a
hand-held tool. Stitches are often used to close
the opening in the skin.

Skin biopsies are done using a local anesthetic
(numbing medicine), which is injected into the
area with a very small needle. You will likely
feel a small prick and a little stinging as the
medicine is injected, but you should not feel
any pain during the biopsy. You may also want
to ask how the biopsy incision will be closed.
There are a few options including stitches or a
special glue that can be used.

Skin shave biopsy

A skin shave biopsy can be on the skin surface
(superficial) or deeper. Superficial shave
biopsies are useful for very flat skin lesions.
This type of biopsy removes the top layer of
skin (epidermis) and part of the dermis using a
tool similar to a razor.

Excision biopsy

During an excision biopsy, all or part of the
lesion is removed. This biopsy can be done in
a doctor’s office or at a hospital. If the lesion
is small enough, it may be removed entirely
during the biopsy.

Testing

Imaging | Key points

Imaging

Key points

Imaging tests take pictures (images) of the
inside of your body. These tests are used to
look for cancer. A radiologist, an expert in
interpreting test images, will write a report
and send this report to your doctor. Your test
results will be discussed with you.
An imaging test is not always needed. They
are used to stage lesions that are higher risk.



Treatment planning starts with testing.
Accurate testing is needed to diagnose
and treat basal cell skin cancer.



A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had
in your life. A medical history will help
determine which treatment is best for you.



It is important to find an experienced
health care provider to conduct a
thorough skin and lymph node exam.
They will make note of any spots that
need monitoring or closer examination.



If a concerning lesion is found on your
skin, it will be removed and sent to a lab
to be looked at under a microscope. This
is called a skin biopsy.

CT scan

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed picture. In most cases, contrast
will be used. Contrast dyes are substances
that help certain areas in the body stand out.
They are used to make the pictures clearer.
Contrast materials are not permanent and will
leave the body in your urine.

MRI scan

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Contrast might be used.

Surgery

Treatment for basal cell skin cancer is
based on the risk for recurrence. This
chapter presents an overview of the
types of treatment and what to expect.
Please note, not everyone will receive
the same treatment.

PDEMA

A peripheral and deep en face margin
assessment (PDEMA) refers to a technique
that allows your doctor to view a high-quality
image of the entire marginal surface of excised
tissues. This may also be called a complete
margin assessment. The most common
PDEMA is Mohs micrographic surgery.

Mohs micrographic surgery

Surgery

Mohs micrographic surgery, often referred to
as Mohs surgery, is commonly used to remove
a tumor from the skin.

Treatment options for basal cell skin cancer
aim to remove the cancer completely. First-line
treatment options usually include surgery to
remove the cancer and some of the healthy
tissue around it.

Mohs surgery involves many stages:

Surgical excision

A surgical excision removes the basal cell
lesion as well as some normal-looking
tissue surrounding it (surgical margin). Local
anesthesia will be used to numb the area
before the surgery. Local anesthesia is a
medicine that numbs a small area of the body
to minimize pain. The lesion will be sent to
pathology.
After surgery, your doctor may close the
opening (incision) with stitches. If the opening
is large, you may require a skin graft. A skin
graft takes skin from an unaffected area of the
body and is used to cover damaged skin.



First, your doctor will mark the area to be
removed (including the tumor).



Then, the area will be numbed with a
local anesthetic and your doctor will use
a scalpel to remove a thin layer of the
tumor.



Next, the tissue sample will be evaluated
at an on-site lab. At this time, your tumor
will be wrapped up and you will be asked
to sit in a waiting area until your tissue is
analyzed.

If there are additional areas of concern around
the edges or base of the tissue sample, you
will go back to the operating room for another
round of tissue removal. You will continue this
process until all the affected tissue has
been removed.
Once no more areas of cancer are found, your
doctor will decide the best option to close the
opening. In some cases, the surgical opening
can heal on its own.

Treatment options

Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy

Curettage and electrodesiccation

Curettage and electrodesiccation is a
procedure used to remove low-risk skin
cancers and pre-cancers. During this
procedure, your doctor will inject a medicine in
the affected area to numb it. Then, the tumor
will be removed by scraping it with a special
tool that has a sharp looped edge on one side.
Once the affected area is removed, it will be
cauterized (burned) to control the bleeding and
destroy any remaining tumor.

Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
normal cells. All chemotherapies stop cancer
cells from growing and dividing.
For treatment of basal cell skin cancer, the
following topical drugs may be used:

The curettage and electrodesiccation
procedure may be repeated if the growth is
cancerous. This procedure is a treatment
option for those who cannot have more
invasive surgical procedures.

Surgical excision
Surgery is the primary
treatment option for all
types of basal cell skin
cancer.

Treatment options

Radiation therapy | Systemic therapy

Radiation therapy

Systemic therapy agents used to treat basal
cell skin cancer include:

Radiation therapy (RT) uses radiation from
electrons, photons, x-rays, protons, gamma
rays, or other sources to kill cancer cells and
shrink tumors. RT can be given alone or with
other treatments. Treatment may focus on
individual tumors, a small area of the body,
the entire surface of the skin, or specific lymph
nodes. Radiation therapy can also be given
before, during, or after surgery to treat or slow
the growth of cancer, especially if the surgical
margins have cancer cells.



Vismodegib (Erivedge®) - Vismodegib
may be used for metastatic or locally
advanced basal cell skin cancer. It is often
used as a primary treatment for those
who cannot have surgery or radiation,
or if there are cancer cells found after
surgery and surgery is no longer possible.
Vismodegib is given orally.



Sonidegib (Odomzo®) - Sonidegib
may be used to treat people with locally
advanced basal cell skin cancer that has
recurred following surgery or radiation
therapy, or those who are not candidates
for surgery or radiation therapy. Sonidegib
is given orally.



Cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo®) Cemiplimab-rwlc is an immunotherapy
agent that may be used to treat locally
advanced or metastatic basal cell skin
cancer. It is given if cancer got worse
on vismodegib or sonidegib, or if you
are unable to have those therapies.
Immunotherapy is a type of cancer
treatment that helps your immune system
fight cancer.

Systemic therapy
Systemic therapy is a cancer treatment that
affects the whole body. It includes hormone
therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and
immunotherapy. Each works differently to
shrink the tumor and prevent recurrence.

Targeted therapy
is the use of
drugs that attack
parts of cancer
cells that are
different from
normal skin cells.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Basal Cell Skin Cancer, 2022

Ask your doctor about the goal of systemic

Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.




Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.



Start the conversation

Phase 1 trials study the safety and side
effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach.

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. Try not to
be discouraged if you cannot join. New clinical
trials are always becoming available.

Frequently asked questions

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Phase 4 trials study the long-term safety
and benefit of an FDA-approved treatment.

Skin examination – annually by your
doctor; and you should perform a selfexamination monthly.



Physical examination – you should
perform a self-examination regularly on
your lymph nodes.



Imaging tests – your doctor will order as
needed to look into new symptoms.

Do I have to pay to be in a clinical trial?
Rarely. It depends on the study, your health
insurance, and the state in which you live.
Your treatment team and the research team
can help determine if you are responsible for
any costs.

Treatment by risk

Low risk

Basal cell skin cancer is classified
based on the risk for recurrence. This
chapter presents specific treatment
options based on the type of basal cell
skin cancer.

Surgical excision

Low risk

If cancer cells are found in the surrounding
tissue removed with the tumor, more treatment
is needed.

Surgical excision is a recommended treatment
option for low-risk basal cell skin cancers,
especially for those found on the chest, back,
hands, and feet. A surgical excision surgery
removes the basal cell lesion as well as some
normal-looking tissue surrounding it (surgical
margin). The lesion will be sent to pathology.

Low-risk basal cell skin cancer is considered to
have a low chance of coming back once treated.

Options for the next treatment include:

Surgery is the preferred treatment for low-risk
basal cell skin cancer.
Surgery options include:


Curettage and electrodesiccation



Surgical excision

If you are not a candidate for surgery, radiation
therapy is usually an option.

Mohs surgery or other forms of PDEMA



Another surgical excision (if possible)



Radiation therapy (if surgery is not
appropriate)

Call your doctor
if you have any
signs of infection
such as pus,
fever or chills,
redness, or pain
from the wound.

Curettage and electrodesiccation

Curettage and electrodesiccation is the
recommended treatment option for low-risk
basal cell skin cancer. During the procedure,
your doctor will inject a medicine into the
affected area to numb it. Then, the tumor will
be removed by scraping it with a special tool
that has a sharp looped edge on one side. If
the tumor ends up being deeper than expected
during the procedure, a standard surgical
excision may be needed to remove deep areas
of cancerous tissue.

High risk

Mohs surgery

Mohs surgery removes tumors from the skin.
If there are additional areas of concern around
the edges or base of the tissue sample, you
will go back to the operating room for another
round of tissue removal. You will continue this
process until all the affected tissue has been
removed.

High-risk basal cell skin cancer means there
is a higher chance of the cancer coming back
after treatment.
Surgery is the preferred treatment for high-risk
basal cell skin cancer.

If Mohs is unsuccessful at removing all of the
cancer, more treatment is needed. If another
surgery can be performed, this is generally
tried first. Otherwise, radiation therapy (RT)
is used. In some cases, systemic therapy is
given if RT and surgery are not possible.

Surgery options include:


Mohs surgery or other forms of PDEMA



Surgical excision

If you are not a candidate for surgery, you will
receive one of the following:

Radiation therapy



Systemic therapy

If Mohs surgery was successful, but cancer
cells were found in or around nerves or the
cancer had concerning microscopic findings,
RT may be considered.

High-risk sites for
basal cell
Basal cell skin cancer is
most often considered high
risk when it is found on the
eyelids, nose, ears, or skin
around the eyes.

PDEMA

A peripheral and deep en face margin
assessment (PDEMA) refers to a technique
that allows your doctor to view a high-quality
image of the entire marginal surface of excised
tissues. This may also be called a complete
margin assessment.

After initial treatment is finished, you will be
monitored for cancer that may return. This is
called a recurrence or disease that advances
(gets worse).

Surgical excision

Testing

A standard surgical excision with wider surgical
margins is recommended for high-risk basal
cell skin cancer. A wider surgical margin
refers to the area of normal tissue removed
around the lesion. You will be tested after the
procedure to identify if the surgery removed all
of the cancer cells. If testing finds cancer in the
margin, more treatment is needed.

Testing will help to identify how you should be
treated next.
Testing will include:

Additional treatment
If cancer still remains and more surgery is
not possible, a discussion between different
cancer physicians is needed to determine the
next steps. Treatment at this point may include
RT or systemic therapy if RT is not possible.

If surgery is not an option



Medical history and physical exam –
Expect a complete skin exam every 6 to
12 months for the first 5 years, and then
annually for life.



Imaging – Your doctor may ask for a
CT scan or other imaging test to confirm
diagnosis.



Patient education – Your doctor will likely
discuss prevention techniques such as
using an SPF sunscreen and performing
self-exams.

Treatment

If surgery is not an option, RT is typically
used. If RT is not possible, you will receive
systemic therapy.

Treatment depends on whether the cancer has
returned or advanced (gotten worse).
If cancer returns at or near the same place,
you will be treated with surgery.
If you are not a candidate for surgery,
treatment options may include:

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your doctor.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
If you take the time to build a relationship with
your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

It’s your choice

Second opinion

In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.


Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:



What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Basal Cell Skin Cancer, 2022

Things you can do to prepare:


Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Support groups

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people
with cancer, check out the websites listed
in this book.
