About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Multiple Myeloma, Version 1.2025 – September 17, 2024.

Multiple myeloma (also simply called
myeloma) is a type of blood cancer that begins
in bones and spreads to other areas of the
body. It results when cancerous cells—called
myeloma cells—build up in the bone marrow.
Bone marrow is the soft, sponge-like center
inside bones where most blood cells are made.

Myeloma cells
Blood in the bone marrow is
made up of different blood cells,
including white blood cells
called plasma cells.
Multiple myeloma happens
when normal plasma cells turn
into abnormal myeloma cells.
Myeloma cells multiply and
crowd out healthy blood cells.
When your body has fewer
healthy blood cells, symptoms
and organ damage can occur.

1 About multiple myeloma » What is multiple myeloma?

In someone with myeloma, the myeloma cells
become so numerous in the bone marrow
that they can crowd out healthy blood cells,
causing harmful blood-related problems.

This oversupply of myeloma cells also reduces
the number of healthy white blood cells in
the body, which can increase the risk of
infections. In addition, myeloma cells release
large amounts of abnormal myeloma proteins,

Where do myeloma cells come from?
When antigens (such as germs) invade
the body, healthy white blood cells
called plasma cells release germ-fighting
antibodies to stop infection and disease.
But in multiple myeloma, one or more
mutations cause plasma cells to become

multiple myeloma cells. Multiple myeloma
cells can multiply and spread rapidly. They
also produce a lot of abnormal antibodies
called M proteins, which can build up in the
bone marrow and cause damage.

which can impair bodily functions (like kidney
function).

These mutations occur in the cells’ genes.
Genes are the instructions that control what a
cell does and how long it stays alive. Mutations
can change these instructions, and turn normal
plasma cells into cancerous myeloma cells.

Myeloma cells can also cause bones to break
down, leading to weakened bones, bone pain,
fractures, and high calcium levels in the blood.

Cancerous myeloma cells can make millions of
new identical myeloma cells that aren’t needed
and don’t die quickly when old or damaged.

When myeloma cells build up in bone marrow,
they can form tumors called plasmacytomas.
In most people with this disease, multiple
plasmacytomas form in different bones or
areas of the body, which is why it’s called
multiple myeloma.

The myeloma cells can spread throughout
the bone marrow and grow into a clump
(plasmacytoma) in one or more spots inside or
outside of the bone marrow.

What causes multiple
myeloma?

Myeloma cells, like plasma cells, also make
antibodies. But the antibodies made by
myeloma cells are all copies of a single type
of antibody. These antibodies are called
monoclonal proteins, or M proteins. (The term
monoclonal means “one clone” or “one type”).

Many people wonder why they got cancer. We
don’t know exactly what causes myeloma cells
to form. But we do know that myelomas often
start with genetic abnormalities (mutations) in
certain cells called plasma cells.

Unlike normal germ-fighting antibodies, M
proteins don’t help get rid of infections. In fact,
your body can’t use M proteins for anything,
so they pile up. Too many M proteins in your
body can lead to problems like thickened
blood and kidney damage. In addition, people
with myeloma don’t make enough normal
antibodies, which raises the risk for infection.

Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell
that fights infection and disease. Plasma cells
do this by making antibodies (also called
immunoglobulins, shortened to Ig). Antibodies
are proteins released into blood and other body
fluids that help your body find and kill germs.

Myeloma mutations aren’t typically passed
down in families (hereditary mutation). But you
may have a higher risk for myeloma if another
family member also had myeloma.

Like other healthy cells, plasma cells grow and
then divide to make new cells. When plasma
cells grow old or get damaged, they die—a
normal and natural process.
But at some point in this process, genetic
changes can occur that turn a plasma cell into a
myeloma cell.

1 About multiple myeloma » Can myeloma be cured?

Can myeloma be cured?

For many people, treatment can keep
myeloma under control and reduce or stop
symptoms for a long period of time.

Currently, myeloma can’t be cured, but it can
be treated and controlled for a significant
amount of time.

Standard treatments for multiple myeloma
include targeted drugs, immunotherapy drugs,
chemotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T-cell therapy, and hematopoietic cell
transplant.

New treatments have resulted in more longterm survivors of myeloma now than ever
before. For an increasing number of people,
myeloma is a chronic medical problem they
learn to live with rather than a disease that
they die from.

Some treatments may be given as a
combination of pills, injections, or an infusion
through an IV (intravenous line). Another
option is taking part in a clinical trial of a
potential new treatment.
Sooner or later, myeloma usually comes back
and requires additional treatment. People with
longstanding multiple myeloma can eventually
become resistant to therapies, which makes
the cancer more difficult to treat and more
dangerous.

“Be your own advocate. Ask a lot of
questions, even the ones you’re afraid
to ask. You have to ensure you make
the best decisions for your particular
situation.”

1 About multiple myeloma » What’s in this book?

What’s in this book?
This chapter provides only a brief overview of
multiple myeloma. The other chapters in this
book explain:

Consider going to a cancer
specialist, cancer center, or
hospital experienced in treating
people with multiple myeloma.

Tests to diagnose the disease –
You’ll have a variety of tests to identify
your specific cancer and determine how
advanced the cancer is. Tests are also used
to plan treatment, check how well treatment
is working, and monitor your health after
treatment ends.

What can you do to get the
best care?

Different treatments and what they
do – Once your care team knows the extent
of your myeloma, you can work together
with your team to consider all your available
treatment options.

Advocate for yourself. You have an important
role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more
likely to get the care you want by asking
questions and making shared decisions with
your care team.

Which treatment is right for you –
There are many different kinds of treatment
for multiple myeloma. If your first treatment
program doesn’t reduce the myeloma, you can
have a different treatment.

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help
you understand cancer care. With better
understanding, you’ll be more prepared to
discuss your care with your team and share
your concerns. Many people feel more
satisfied, confident, and less anxious when
they play an active role in their care.

What happens after treatment – Even
with the best treatment, multiple myeloma
often comes back. So follow-up visits are
important. You can also have further treatment.

You may not know what to ask your care
team. That’s common. Each chapter in this
book ends with an important section called
Questions to ask. These suggested questions
will help you get more information on all
aspects of your care.

Care beyond cancer – Side effects and
other problems can occur during treatment or
arise later. Your care team has ways to relieve
symptoms and side effects. They can help you
with non-medical issues, too.

Take the next step and keep reading to learn
what is the best care for you!

If your doctor suspects you have

myeloma cells collecting in certain parts of the
body.

myeloma, you’ll need several medical
tests before you receive treatment.

The most common symptoms of multiple
myeloma are bone pain (often in the back),
fatigue, and frequent infections. However, some
people may have few or no symptoms at all.

All of these tests help figure out
whether you need treatment and
which treatment is best for you.

Not knowing if you have cancer is scary.
Having tests for cancer can be scary, too. This
chapter will help you know what to expect
during these tests. Knowing more about
myeloma and what to do about it may reduce
some of the fear.

Some tests check your general health. Other
tests are for diagnosing your illness, which will
help plan your treatment. Not every person
with myeloma will receive every test listed
here. See Guide 1.

Medical history

Bone tissue tests

Your medical history includes all the health
events in your life and any medications you’ve
taken. A medical history is needed for planning
your treatment. You’ll be asked about any
illnesses, injuries, and health problems you’ve
had. Some health problems run in families. So
your doctor may also ask about the health of
your blood relatives.

Physical exam
Doctors typically perform a physical exam
along with taking a medical history. A physical
exam is a “hands on” review of your body for
signs of disease.

Common symptoms of
multiple myeloma

During this exam, your doctor will listen to your
lungs, heart, and gut. Parts of your body will
likely be felt to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched.
Your doctor will also look for signs of other
problems such as bruising, swollen glands,
muscle weakness, or numbness/tingling/pain
in your hands or feet (neuropathy).

Bone damage and
pain

Fatigue and
weakness

Blood tests
Your blood can tell doctors a lot about your
health. Blood tests and other tests help confirm
(diagnose) myeloma.

Frequent infections
and fever

Blood is made of red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets. It also has many proteins
and other chemicals. Different types of blood
tests are used to measure these different
substances in the blood.

Bruising or bleeding
easily

Some blood tests are used to assess the
extent or amount of cancer in your body. This
is referred to as the tumor burden. Other tests
are used to check the health of your bones,
kidneys, and other organs. Blood tests may be
repeated to find out how well cancer treatment
is working and to check for side effects.

Thirst and frequent
urination

For a blood test, a needle is inserted into your
vein to remove a sample of blood. The blood
sample is then sent to a lab for testing. At the
lab, a specialist called a pathologist will look at
the blood sample under a microscope.

2 Testing for myeloma » Blood tests

What are antibodies?

Understanding antibodies can help you
understand your multiple myeloma diagnosis.

The five different types of heavy chains can
bond with either of the two types of light chains.
Together, they form antibody subtypes such as
IgG kappa, IgG lambda, IgA kappa, IgA lambda,
and so forth.

Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins, or Ig)
are part of the immune system. They’re made
by plasma cells to fight infection. Antibodies
identify harmful bacteria and viruses, and help
the immune system to get rid of them.

Myeloma cells also make antibodies, which are
called M proteins. Like normal antibodies, M
proteins are made up of a pair of heavy chains
and a pair of light chains. Myeloma cells make
very large numbers of M proteins, which are
usually all of one subtype. (The most common is
IgG kappa.)

Each plasma cell releases only one type of
antibody. Like snowflakes, antibodies are
similar but no two are alike. Each antibody has
a different role. The type of antibody made is
meant to attack the specific germ causing an
infection or illness.

Sometimes, the myeloma cells only produce
light chains, either kappa or lambda. This results
in extra light chains circulating in the blood.
These are called free light chains. Some people
with myeloma have high levels of free light
chains found in their blood or urine.

Antibodies are made up of two pairs of protein
“chains” that are bound together in a Y shape.
This includes two identical “heavy” protein
chains and two identical “light” protein chains.
•

Heavy chains – There are five types of
heavy chains: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE.

•

Light chains – There are two types of light
chains: kappa and lambda.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Multiple Myeloma, 2025

Knowing your M protein subtype will help you
to better understand your test results. You
can follow your M protein level to see if it’s
decreasing, stable, or increasing, which reflects
the response to your treatment.

13

2 Testing for myeloma » Urine tests

Free light chain assay

Pathologists are experts in examining cells
for disease. They may be able to observe
myeloma cells and detect myeloma proteins in
the blood.

This test measures the amount of free light
chains in the blood. It's useful for diagnosing
myeloma in certain cases where myeloma
cells produce only light chains (light chain
myeloma). Free light chain assay is also used
for monitoring myeloma.

Blood tests used for myeloma include:

CBC with differential

Blood chemistry

A complete blood count (CBC) is a test that
measures the number of blood cells in a blood
sample. It includes the number of white blood
cells, red blood cells, and platelets. The CBC
should include a differential. The differential
measures the different types of white blood
cells in the sample.

Blood chemistry tests measure the levels of
different chemicals in your blood. Chemicals
in your blood come from your liver, bone, and
other organs and tissues. Abnormal levels
of certain chemicals in the blood may be a
sign that an organ isn’t working well. These
abnormal levels can be caused by cancer or
other health problems.

Immunoglobulin levels
This test measures the amount of antibodies
(IgA, IgG, IgM, and sometimes IgD and IgE)
in the blood. It shows if the level of any type of
antibody is too high or too low. Abnormal levels
of antibodies could indicate multiple myeloma.

Urine tests
Besides blood, urine also reveals signs of
disease. Urine tests can be used to diagnose
myeloma, assess if your kidneys are working
well, and check the results of cancer
treatments. Urine tests are also used to assess
the tumor burden—the extent or amount of
myeloma in your body.

M proteins in blood
You’ll have two tests to check the M proteins in
your blood:
Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is a test
that measures the amount of M proteins in the
blood. This test is used for both diagnosis and
monitoring.

Total protein in urine
Total protein is a test that measures the total
amount and type of protein in urine. For this
test, urine is collected over a 24-hour period.
Testing 24-hour urine for protein helps to
measure the tumor burden in people with
myeloma. This test can also show if you’re
losing albumin, an important protein, through
your kidneys.

Serum immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE)
identifies which type of M proteins are in the
blood. It finds the type by showing which
forms of heavy chains (IgG, IgA, etc.) and light
chains (kappa or lambda) are present.

marrow. An aspiration removes a small amount
of liquid bone marrow from inside the bone.

Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP)
measures the amount of M proteins, albumin,
and light chains in the urine. Low levels of
albumin may be a sign of advanced myeloma
or another health condition. High levels of light
chains in the urine indicate a greater risk for
kidney damage in people with myeloma. The
UPEP test may be repeated after treatment to
check how your treatment is working.

You may be given a light sedative before the
test. Your provider will then clean the area of
skin where the biopsy will be done. Next, you’ll
receive local anesthesia to numb the area of
skin and bone beneath.
Once numb, a hollow needle will be inserted
into your skin and then pushed into the bone to
remove the liquid bone marrow with a syringe.

Urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIFE)
is a test that identifies the type of M proteins
and light chains present in urine. UIFE is done
along with other initial tests when myeloma
is first found. UIFE is also used to check how
well your treatment is working.

Then the needle will be inserted into the bone
to remove the solid bone marrow core sample.
You’ll notice a feeling of pressure as this is
happening and you might feel some pain while
the samples are being removed. Afterward,
your skin may be bruised for a few days.
There’s a small risk of bleeding or infection,
but these aren’t common.

Bone tissue tests

Lab tests

To confirm you have cancer, a sample of tissue
or fluid must be removed from your body for
testing. This is called a biopsy. A biopsy is
generally a safe test and can often be done in
about 30 minutes.

After the biopsied tissue samples are
collected, they’ll be sent to a lab for testing.
A pathologist will view the samples under a
microscope to look for myeloma cells. The
pathologist may also perform other tests on the
samples. It often takes several days before the
test results are known. The lab tests that may
be performed on the tissue samples are:

Bone marrow biopsy and
aspiration
Myeloma cells are often found in the bone
marrow, so that’s where people with myeloma
are biopsied. The sample is usually taken
out of the pelvic bone (near the hip), which
contains a large amount of bone marrow and
is close to the surface of the body.

Immunohistochemistry
This test is used to identify the number and the
type of myeloma cells in the bone marrow. A
diagnosis of myeloma can be made when at
least 10% of cells (1 out of every 10 cells) in
the bone marrow sample are abnormal plasma
cells.

This is a two-part test that results in two
samples. A bone marrow biopsy removes
a small core of bone containing the bone

2 Testing for myeloma » Bone tissue tests

Flow cytometry
This test can identify abnormal plasma cells
in the bone marrow by detecting certain
characteristic proteins on the outer surface of
the cells. Flow cytometry isn’t always done at
diagnosis—it might be done after treatment to
check for traces of myeloma.

genetic changes in chromosomes can help
your treatment team better understand your
diagnosis and prognosis, and more precisely
plan your treatment.
Abnormal genetic changes include deletions
and additions to chromosomes, as well as
translocations (swapping) of parts between
chromosomes. To that end, FISH helps
determine whether someone’s myeloma might
be at higher risk for coming back quickly
(relapse) or not get better while on treatment
(progression).

FISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
testing looks for abnormal changes in
the chromosomes of myeloma cells.
Chromosomes are long strands of genes
inside each cell that carry DNA—the body’s
“instruction manual.” Identifying abnormal

Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration
Doctors use a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to remove samples of solid bone
marrow and liquid bone marrow for testing. These samples are often removed at the
same time from the pelvic bone.

2 Testing for myeloma » Bone tissue tests

How abnormal changes in chromosomes affect myeloma
Chromosomes are made up of genes that carry DNA, the body’s genetic instructions.
Abnormal changes in chromosomes can disrupt a gene’s function. An abnormality may cause
genes to make too many or too few proteins, for example, leading to disease or illness.

Abnormal changes that are important in multiple myeloma include:
Deletion

A deletion is a loss of part
of a chromosome. For
example, a deletion of all or
part of chromosome 13 may
indicate more aggressive
myeloma.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Multiple Myeloma, 2025

Duplication/
amplification

A duplication is when part of
a chromosome is repeated.
An amplification is when
those genes are duplicated
multiple times. Amplification
of a part of chromosome 1
(1q21) is linked with more
aggressive myeloma.

17

Translocation

A translocation is when
part of one chromosome
breaks off and switches
places with part of another
chromosome. For example,
a translocation between
part of chromosome 4 and
part of chromosome 14 is
associated with high-risk
myeloma.

2 Testing for myeloma » Imaging tests

Imaging tests

High risk is associated with having any of the
following abnormal changes. Very high risk
is associated with having 2 or more of these
changes.

Imaging tests take pictures (images) of the
inside of your body. The images can show the
size, location, and other features of myeloma
in your bones.

Deletion of part or all of chromosome 17
Translocation between parts of
chromosomes 4 and 14

Because myeloma cells may live inside any
bone in your body, it’s important that your
whole body be scanned in order not to miss
the diagnosis. After diagnosis, imaging can
also show how well your treatment is working
or if the myeloma is growing.

Types of imaging include low-dose PET/CT
scan, CT scan, x-ray, and MRI.

PET/CT scan
PET and CT are two types of imaging tests.
These tests are often done at the same time.
When used together, it’s called a PET/CT
scan.

PET/CT scan
Imaging instruments, like
this PET/CT scanner, can
show what’s going on
inside your body. During
the scan, you’ll lie on a
table that moves into the
tunnel of the machine. The
scan can detect even small
amounts of cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Multiple Myeloma, 2025

18

2 Testing for myeloma » Imaging tests

Low-dose CT scan

A whole-body PET/CT scan is very good at
showing where active myeloma is located in
the body, both in the bones and elsewhere.
And the CT part of PET/CT can help show
bone damage from myeloma. Since bone
lesions are common in people with multiple
myeloma, an imaging test such as PET/CT
scan is strongly recommended.

CT takes many pictures of a body part from
different angles using x-rays. A computer
combines all the pictures to make a series
of cross-sectional images. The amount of
radiation used for this type of scan is much
lower than standard doses of a CT scan.
A whole-body low-dose CT scan may be used
to check the whole body for lytic bone lesions.
Lytic bone lesions look as if the bone has
cracks in them. These lesions may cause pain,
weaken the bones, and lead to fractures.

To create images, a radiotracer first needs
to be injected into your body through a vein.
The radiotracer emits a small amount of
energy that’s detected by the PET scanner.
The radiotracer makes myeloma cells appear
brighter in the images. The most commonly
used radiotracer is called FDG. NCCN experts
recommend using FDG for PET/CT scans for
multiple myeloma.

Bone survey
A bone survey uses x-rays to take pictures
of your entire skeleton to look for broken or
damaged bones.

FDG is a substance similar to glucose (sugar).
If you have diabetes, the scan can’t be done if
your blood sugar is too high.

Bone surveys have mostly been replaced by
PET/CT or whole-body low-dose CT scans,
which show bone lesions much better than

PET scans
PET scans highlight areas of
the body that have busy cellular
activity, like the brain, kidneys, and
bladder. Cancer cells are also very
active and are highlighted on PET
scans, too.
This PET scan (left) shows a patient
with many areas of myeloma in the
bones. After CAR T-cell therapy,
the areas affected by myeloma are
nearly eliminated (right).

multiple myeloma and some of its treatments
can affect heart function in some people.

MRI scan
MRI uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of the inside of the body. It
makes images of bone and bone marrow. This
type of scan may show abnormal areas where
myeloma cells have replaced bone marrow.

Light chain amyloidosis biopsy
Light chain amyloid (or AL amyloid) is a rare
protein found in people with abnormal plasma
cells that make abnormally folded light chains.
AL amyloid can collect and build up in tissues
and organs throughout the body. The buildup
of AL amyloid proteins, called AL amyloidosis,
can damage organs such as the heart and
kidneys. Tests for AL amyloidosis can be done
on a sample of bone marrow, the fat pad (fat
from just under the skin of the belly), or an
organ that may have amyloid deposits in it.

MRI is particularly useful for telling the
difference between multiple myeloma and
smoldering myeloma, and for looking at soft
tissues in the body. It’s also used to distinguish
between bone fractures due to myeloma and
those due to osteoporosis.

Other tests used in certain
cases

Ask for a second opinion

Not everyone requires every test. These tests
are only used in certain circumstances:

It’s normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. Still, there’s usually enough time
to have another cancer care provider review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

Blood viscosity
Blood viscosity is a test that measures the
thickness of your blood. Having a lot of
M proteins in your blood can make your
blood very thick—a rare condition called
hyperviscosity. Hyperviscosity is associated
with myeloma that produces a higher number
of immunoglobulins.

Seek out a myeloma specialist, if you
can, because they have more experience
diagnosing and treating people with this
disease. Treatment decisions made by a
non-myeloma specialist can seriously affect
later treatment decisions. Most people with
myeloma have time for a second opinion from
a myeloma specialist. Make use of that time.

Hyperviscosity can lead to neurological
symptoms, headaches, vision problems,
shortness of breath, bleeding, and damage to
your kidneys and other organs.

Questions to ask

The tests described in this chapter are used
not only to diagnose multiple myeloma, but
also to plan and track treatment. Importantly,
several of these tests are used to find out if
you’re able to have a hematopoietic (bloodforming) cell transplant.

Where do I go to get tested? How long
will the tests take? Will any of the tests
hurt?
How often are these tests wrong?
How soon will I know the results and who
will explain them to me?
Will my biopsy tissue be saved for further
testing? Can I have it sent to another
facility for additional testing?
How can I get a second opinion?

Cancer tests are used to make a
diagnosis, plan treatment, and check how
well treatment is working.
Blood and urine tests check for signs of
disease.

“Myeloma is a cancer for which we have
dozens of available treatment options.
If we partner with skilled myeloma
specialists to make intelligent treatment
decisions, we can expect to live many
years of quality life.”

Samples of tissue and fluid from the bone
marrow are tested to confirm myeloma.
Myeloma cells may exist inside any bone
in your body, so imaging is used to scan
your whole body for signs of the disease.
Getting a second opinion is a good idea,
and is a normal part of cancer care.

cells. CAR T-cell therapy reprograms your
natural T cells to improve their ability to
recognize and target cancer cells.

Targeted therapy drugs identify specific
features of cancer cells to find and attack
them. The most common targeted therapy
options to treat myeloma are proteasome
inhibitors and antibody drugs, but a variety of
medications are available:








Proteasome inhibitors block the
action of certain proteins (proteasomes)
that allow myeloma cells to survive.



Monoclonal antibodies are artificial
antibodies that attach to proteins on
cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies invite
other immune cells to attack cancer cells.



Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
T-cell therapy is a treatment made from
your own T cells. A T cell is a type of white
blood cell that hunts and destroys cancer
cells, infected cells, and other damaged

Small molecule inhibitors are drugs
whose molecules are so small, they
can penetrate inside cancer cells. Once
inside, a small molecule inhibitor targets
proteins or other molecules, causing the
cancer cell to die.
Nuclear export inhibitors prevent
proteins from leaving the nucleus of
cancer cells, which stops the cancer cells
from functioning.
Bispecific antibodies are drugs that
seek two targets. A bispecific antibody
attaches to both T cells and to myeloma
cells, bringing the cells together so that
the T cells attack the myeloma cells.

How targeted therapy works: One example
Targeted therapy drugs work
in different ways. One way
is by blocking a process
that keeps the myeloma cell
alive. One such process:
Proteasomes that clear out
waste proteins in myeloma
cells.

But a targeted drug can block
proteasomes from carrying
out this process. If the
proteasomes are halted, then
the waste proteins build up
inside the cells.

Eventually, the myeloma

Side effects of targeted therapy
A side effect is an unhealthy or unpleasant
physical or mental condition caused by
treatment. Any treatment for myeloma can
cause side effects.

of infection. A low platelet count can increase
the risk of bruising and bleeding.
Other common side effects are blood clots,
shortness of breath, skin rash, common cold,
muscle aches, heart issues, and numbness or
tingling in the hands or feet (called peripheral
neuropathy).

Common side effects of targeted therapy
medications include fatigue, drowsiness,
weakness, headache, chills, loss of appetite,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and
fatigue. Some of these medications can also
lower the level of important minerals and
electrolytes in the body.

Some people have many side effects while
others have few. Some side effects can be
very serious while others can be unpleasant
but not serious.

Targeted therapy drugs may also reduce the
number of red blood cells, white blood cells,
or platelets in your body. A low white blood cell
count can lower immunity and increase the risk

Most side effects appear soon after treatment
starts and go away after treatment ends. Other
side effects are long-term or may appear years
later.

It takes a team
Treating multiple myeloma takes a team
approach. Your team should communicate
and work together to bring the best
knowledge from each specialty. This is called
multidisciplinary care.

A diagnostic radiologist reads the
results of PET/CT scans and other imaging
tests.
A radiation oncologist prescribes and
plans radiation therapy.

Your multidisciplinary team is made up of
a number of cancer specialists and care
providers. These include:

An orthopedic surgeon treats fractures
in the vertebrae and other bones.
Your primary care doctor handles
medical care not related to your cancer. Your
primary doctor can help you express your
thoughts about treatments to your cancer
care team.

A medical oncologist treats cancer using
systemic therapies such as chemotherapy
and immunotherapy. A medical oncologist
will often coordinate your care with
other team members. If not, ask who will
coordinate your care.

3 Types of treatment » Multi-drug therapy

The side effects of therapy can depend on the
drug and the dose. Some of the side effects
are caused by several drugs but differ in how
likely they are to occur. Other side effects
are caused by only one type of drug. For
example, side effects of CAR T-cell therapy
include headaches, confusion, seizures, and
a dangerous condition called cytokine release
syndrome. This condition can cause fever,
chills, nausea, headaches, racing heartbeat,
low blood pressure, and trouble breathing.

becoming pregnant or getting someone
pregnant while using them. Side effects are
more common with thalidomide than with other
immunomodulators.

Steroids
Corticosteroids (often just called steroids) are
used to relieve swelling and inflammation.
Some steroids also have anti-cancer effects.
Steroids are often used with chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, or both to treat myeloma.
Steroids may be given as a pill, a liquid, or an
IV injection.

Not all side effects of different targeted
therapies are listed here. Be sure to ask your
treatment team for a complete list of common
and rare side effects.

Side effects of steroids
Common side effects of steroids are feeling
hungry, trouble sleeping, slow wound healing,
upset stomach, muscle weakness, weight gain,
and swelling in the ankles, feet, and hands.
Steroids may also significantly increase blood
sugar levels. Steroids make some people feel
irritable and cranky. Changes in mood can
happen from day to day.

If a side effect bothers you, tell someone on
your treatment team. There may be ways to
help you feel better. There are also ways to
prevent some side effects.

Immunomodulators
Immunomodulators are a type of
immunotherapy. Immunotherapy uses your
body’s immune system—your natural defense
against infection and disease—to fight cancer.
Immunomodulators increase the immune
system’s ability to find and destroy cancer
cells.

Most side effects of steroids go away after
the drugs are stopped. When used for a long
time, steroids can lead to weakening of bones,
thinning of skin, and increased risk of diabetes,
cataracts, ulcers, and infections.

Chemotherapy

Immunomodulators are oral drugs that are
often prescribed for many months or even
years.

Chemotherapy (or chemo) is a drug therapy
for destroying cancer cells. Chemotherapy
is a systemic (whole-body) therapy that kills
fast-growing cells throughout the body. Cancer
cells are fast-growing cells, but some normal
cells are fast-growing too.

Side effects of immunomodulators
Immunomodulators may cause drowsiness,
fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, rash, low
blood cell counts, serious blood clots, and
peripheral neuropathy. Immunomodulators
can also lead to birth defects, so avoid

ones from being made. Many chemotherapy
drugs are liquids that are slowly injected
into a vein (IV infusion) or underneath the
skin (subcutaneous). Some are pills that are
swallowed. The drugs travel in the bloodstream
to treat cancer throughout the body.

Cancer and its treatment—especially when
used in high doses—can damage and destroy
cells in the bone marrow. A hematopoietic
(blood-forming) cell transplant replaces the
damaged or destroyed cells with healthy blood
stem cells. This is also called a stem cell
rescue or a bone marrow transplant.

Chemotherapy is given in cycles. Each cycle
has days of treatment followed by days of
rest. This allows the body to recover before
the next treatment cycle. Cycles vary in length
depending on which drugs are used. Often,
the cycles are 14, 21, or 28 days long. The
number of treatment days per cycle and the
total number of cycles given also vary based
on the chemotherapy used.

Where do healthy blood stem cells come
from? They typically come from the patient’s
own blood. A blood stem cell is a special kind
of cell that can develop into any type of blood
cell. After a hematopoietic cell transplant, the
healthy blood stem cells grow new blood cells
and bone marrow.

Side effects of chemotherapy
Like other therapies, the side effects of
chemotherapy depend on many factors. These
include the drug, the dose, and the person.

Hematopoietic cell transplants are a common
treatment for multiple myeloma, but they’re not
for everyone. A hematopoietic cell transplant is
an intense treatment. The transplant process
can take several weeks, and recovery may
take several months.

In general, side effects are caused by the
death of fast-growing cells, which are found
in the intestines, mouth, and blood. Some
chemotherapy drugs can also cause damage
to your bone marrow.

Your treatment team will consider many factors
when deciding if you can benefit from this
procedure. Some of these factors include your
fitness level, health status, vital organ function,
cancer stage, previous treatments, other
medical conditions, available supportive care,
and additional factors—including your goals
and wishes.

Common side effects of chemotherapy are
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores,
loss of appetite, hair loss, and low blood cell
counts. Feeling very tired (fatigue) or weak is
also common.
Not all side effects of chemotherapy are listed
here. Be sure to ask your treatment team for a
complete list of common and rare side effects
for the medications you’ll be receiving. If a side
effect bothers you, tell your treatment team.
There may be ways to help you feel better.
There are also ways to prevent some side
effects.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Multiple Myeloma, 2025

A hematopoietic cell transplant is usually
performed after you’ve had initial treatment.
Some people who aren’t able to have a
hematopoietic cell transplant at first may be
able to have one if their condition improves
after initial treatment.

28

3 Types of treatment » Hematopoietic cell transplant

Here’s a step-by-step description of a
hematopoietic cell transplant:

The main procedure is called apheresis,
which uses a special machine to collect stem
cells from your bloodstream. You may need
a number of apheresis procedures to obtain
enough blood stem cells.

Collecting blood stem cells
The first step is to collect, or harvest, the
stem cells in your blood. Beforehand, you’ll
be given injections (shots) of growth factors
that will boost the amount of blood stem cells
in the bone marrow and move them into the
bloodstream.

The blood stem cells are often frozen and
stored until they’re needed. Your doctor or care
team may recommend collecting additional
cells for a second transplant in the future if
your myeloma comes back.

How a hematopoietic cell transplant is done
First, blood stem cells are
removed (harvested) from
the patient’s blood or bone
marrow.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Multiple Myeloma, 2025

Second, the harvested
blood stem cells are
concentrated and frozen for
preservation. Meanwhile, the
patient receives high-dose
chemotherapy to destroy any
myeloma cells in the bone
marrow.

29

Lastly, the blood stem cells
are returned (transfused)
to the patient, where they’ll
grow healthy new cells in the
bone marrow.

3 Types of treatment » Radiation therapy

High-dose chemotherapy

Side effects of hematopoietic cell
transplant

The next step is receiving high-dose
chemotherapy. Chemotherapy destroys any
myeloma cells in your bone marrow. But it also
destroys normal cells in your bone marrow.
This greatly weakens your immune system,
leaving you very vulnerable to infections.

High-dose chemotherapy can result in nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, loss of appetite,
and mouth sores.
You’ll likely feel tired and weak after the
transplant and while waiting for the new blood
stem cells to grow in the bone marrow. This
weak and unpleasant feeling might last for
several weeks after you go home, too.

You’ll receive antibiotics and take other
precautions to avoid infection for the next few
weeks.

Replacing blood stem cells

Radiation therapy

A day or two after chemotherapy, your blood
stem cells will be put back into your body with
a transfusion. A transfusion is a slow injection
into a large vein. This process can take several
hours to complete.

Radiation therapy is a type of local therapy.
Local therapy treats cancer cells only in
a specific area of the body. For myeloma,
radiation therapy is most commonly used
to treat a painful area of bone damage, a
plasmacytoma that’s causing pain (palliative
treatment), or a bone that may break.

The transplanted blood stem cells will quickly
travel to your bone marrow and begin to
settle in and grow. This is called engraftment.
Depending on the type of transplant, it usually
takes about 2 to 4 weeks for your bone marrow
and blood cells to return to minimum safe
levels.

Radiation therapy is also sometimes used as
the only treatment for a solitary plasmacytoma
(a single mass of myeloma cells).
Radiation therapy involves a large machine
that sends out high-energy rays to a specific
area of cancer cells. This either kills the cancer
cells or stops new cancer cells from being
made.

Until then, you’ll have little or no immune
defense. It may take a few weeks or months
for the blood cells to fully recover so that your
immune system is back to normal. While the
new blood stem cells grow, you’ll be given
transfusions of platelets and red blood cells to
restore and maintain your blood counts. You’ll
also to be re-immunized against childhood
illnesses.

Radiation that treats the cancer itself requires
a series of treatments that takes several
weeks. Radiation therapy for pain relief
involves daily treatments over several days.

At some centers, people can receive a
hematopoietic cell transplant as an outpatient
procedure, so they can go home the same day.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Multiple Myeloma, 2025

3 Types of treatment » Surgery » Clinical trial

Clinical trial

Side effects of radiation therapy
Side effects of radiation therapy depend on the
dose, the length of treatment, and what part of
the body received the radiation.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in a
lab, potential new ways of fighting cancer need
to be studied in people. If found to be safe and
effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or
treatment approach may be approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Patients who receive a short course of
treatment for pain relief may not have any side
effects except redness of the skin or slight
irritation in the treated area. Radiation to treat
the cancer itself may cause more side effects
due to the higher dose of radiation and longer
duration of treatment.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your team about whether
a clinical trial would be the best choice for you.

Side effects don’t usually occur during the
actual treatments. But you may have fatigue
that begins after the treatment has finished
and lasts for several weeks. You may also
develop nausea or diarrhea. You may lose
your appetite and may even lose weight during
treatment. Other side effects, such as redness
of the skin or hair loss, may occur in treated
areas.

Phases
Most clinical trials focus on treatment and are
done in phases.

Surgery



Surgery is an operation to remove or repair

fractures in bones or stabilize fractures in the
vertebrae that may be affecting the spinal cord.

Side effects of surgery

Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.
Phase 4 trials study the safety and
benefit of an FDA-approved treatment.

symptoms, including bone lesions and organ
damage.

for multiple myeloma. This chapter
explains how the treatment
process will begin for you.

Active multiple myeloma needs to be treated.
There are many good treatments for active
myeloma—and new ones are being developed
all the time. Treatment focuses on fighting
the cancer as well as relieving symptoms.
Your specific treatment will depend on the
extent or aggressiveness of the myeloma,
your health, your related symptoms, and other
considerations.

Primary treatment is the first treatment used
to rid the body of cancer. Primary treatment is
different for each of the three types of multiple
myeloma:






Active (or symptomatic) multiple
myeloma causes symptoms and
affects organs. Myeloma that’s causing
symptoms should be treated.
Solitary plasmacytoma consists of a
single mass of myeloma cells in bone or
soft tissue. It often causes bone pain or
fractures. Solitary plasmacytoma requires
treatment to the affected area.

Your treatment team will first try therapy that
has shown the greatest chance of success in
people whose myeloma is like yours. This is
called primary treatment. If primary treatment
doesn’t reduce myeloma, you can have
additional treatment.

Smoldering myeloma isn’t active,
doesn’t cause any symptoms or organ
problems, and rarely needs treatment.

Primary treatment
Primary treatment for active multiple myeloma
usually includes several treatments that are
given during the same time:

We’ll talk first about primary treatment
for active multiple myeloma. Later in this

multiple myeloma. The recommended
treatments are bisphosphonates or
denosumab.

Because a hematopoietic (blood-forming)
cell transplant may be a major part of your
treatment plan, testing to find out if you can
have the procedure is done soon after you
start primary treatment.

Supportive care can ease the
symptoms of myeloma and the side
effects of myeloma treatment. Care is
based on the symptoms and side effects
you have. You may receive radiation
therapy to reduce bone pain, for example.
Or, if you’re taking medications that can
cause blood clots, you may be given
blood thinners to lower the chances of
getting a clot.

The transplant itself, which includes highdose chemotherapy, usually occurs right after
completing primary treatment.

Follow-up tests
Follow-up tests let your care team know if
primary treatment is working. Many of the tests
used for follow-up are the same ones used to
diagnose myeloma.

The choice of primary treatment depends on
whether a hematopoietic cell transplant might
be part of your treatment plan.

Common follow-up tests include:

For example, some chemotherapy drugs can
cause severe damage to healthy cells in your
bone marrow. This makes it more difficult
to harvest blood stem cells for a transplant.
So if you’re likely to have a hematopoietic
cell transplant, then chemo drugs aren’t
recommended for your primary treatment.

Treatment response

If your myeloma doesn’t respond to treatment,
it has become progressive disease. See
Chapter 6: Treatment for progression and

A treatment response (also called a remission)
is a measurable improvement caused by
treatment. See Guide 5. The response
is defined by how well treatment destroys
myeloma cells or reduces bone lesions.
Symptoms usually improve with a response to
treatment, too.

Hematopoietic cell transplant
Treatment for active myeloma may or may
not include a hematopoietic cell transplant. A
hematopoietic cell transplant isn’t a treatment
option for everyone. This treatment destroys
cells in the bone marrow with chemotherapy
and then replaces them with healthy blood
stem cells. Your care team will look at a

number of factors to decide if it’s the right
choice for you.

If your myeloma doesn’t improve after the
transplant, your disease is progressing. But
this doesn’t mean you’re out of options.
There’s still much that can be done. See
Chapter 6: Treatment for progression and
relapse.

If your doctor thinks you’ll have a
hematopoietic cell transplant, then your blood
stem cells will be removed (harvested) after
4 to 6 cycles of primary treatment, when the
number of myeloma cells is low.

Maintenance therapy

Collecting blood stem cells when you’re ready
but delaying the transplant until you need it
may also be an option. Or, if you might have a
second transplant as later treatment, enough
blood stem cells should be collected for two
transplants.

Maintenance therapy is medication that’s given
less often or in lower doses to keep (maintain)
the good results of prior treatments.
The preferred maintenance treatment after a
hematopoietic cell transplant is lenalidomide.
Other recommended maintenance treatments
include lenalidomide and carfilzomib or
lenalidomide and daratumumab, among
others.

After the transplant, you’ll have follow-up tests
to check for a treatment response. Tests to
measure the level of M proteins in your blood
and urine should be done at least every 3
months.

Be sure to discuss with your care team the
benefits and risks of having maintenance
therapy.

If your myeloma responds to the transplant
and remains stable or goes into remission,
you’ve hit a major milestone. Take time to
celebrate and appreciate the outcome. Next,
you’ll move on to maintenance therapy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

One risk, for instance, is that maintenance
therapy (especially with lenalidomide) slightly
increases your chance of developing another
cancer.

Continuing therapy

So far, this chapter has discussed

If you aren’t able to have a hematopoietic
cell transplant, or you don’t want a transplant
right away, then another option is to continue
receiving primary treatment or maintenance
treatment, depending on your situation. This
treatment is given until no further improvement
is seen on follow-up tests or until it’s no longer
effective.

primary treatment for active
multiple myeloma. Now let’s talk
about treatment for the other,
less common types of myeloma—
solitary plasmacytoma and
smoldering myeloma.

More follow-up tests
After a hematopoietic cell transplant, or during
maintenance or continuing therapy, you’ll have
more follow-up tests to determine whether the
myeloma is getting worse or getting better.

Solitary plasmacytoma
A solitary plasmacytoma is a single mass
of myeloma cells in a bone or soft tissue.
A solitary plasmacytoma is a type of active
myeloma. So it needs treatment.

These tests also check whether your
treatments are having any toxic (harmful)
effects on your body. Many of these follow-up
tests will be the same ones you’ve had before.

Primary treatment

Relapse

Because there’s only one cancer mass,
treatment for solitary plasmacytoma requires
only local therapy. Local therapy treats a
specific area or part of the body, not the whole
body. The primary local treatment for a solitary
plasmacytoma is radiation therapy. Sometimes
surgery is also required.

Even with the best treatment, multiple
myeloma often comes back (relapses) months
or years after primary treatment.
If your multiple myeloma relapses, you can
have additional therapy that’s different from
your primary treatment. Read about additional
treatment in Chapter 6: Treatment for
progression and relapse.

For people who have a high risk of developing
multiple myeloma, chemotherapy may also be
recommended.

Clinical trial
A clinical trial is also a primary treatment option
for people with solitary plasmacytoma. An
NCCN panel of myeloma experts encourages
people with solitary plasmacytoma to consider
joining a clinical trial.

4 Primary treatment » Smoldering myeloma

Smoldering myeloma

Follow-up tests
Regular follow-up testing is key to detect signs
of progression to active multiple myeloma.

Myeloma that isn’t causing symptoms is called
smoldering myeloma. Smoldering myeloma
rarely needs treatment right away if it hasn’t
caused organ damage or cancer-related
symptoms. NCCN experts recommend that
people who have smoldering myeloma join a
clinical trial.

After primary treatment, people with solitary
plasmacytoma should have follow-up visits
every 3 to 6 months. Blood tests are necessary
at each visit. Imaging should be done on an
annual basis. Other follow-up tests are given
as needed.

However, smoldering myeloma can sometimes
turn into multiple myeloma. Those with highrisk smoldering myeloma may require more
frequent follow-up visits or even treatment. But
in most people, smoldering myeloma can exist
for years before becoming active myeloma.
You may still want to see a myeloma specialist
to make sure your myeloma does not need
treatment.

Progressive disease
If follow-up tests indicate that the
plasmacytoma is progressing even after
treatment, then further testing is necessary.
This includes all the tests required for
diagnosing multiple myeloma. If you’re
diagnosed with multiple myeloma, you can go
back to the beginning of this chapter and read
about primary treatment for active multiple
myeloma.

Observation
Observation without treatment is an option
for many people with inactive smoldering
myeloma. Observation means that you’ll have
regular follow-up visits so your care team can
look out for any cancer growth or symptoms.

It’s important to know that about half of people
with solitary plasmacytoma never progress to
multiple myeloma.

Clinical trial
A clinical trial is a preferred primary treatment
option for people with smoldering myeloma.
An NCCN panel of myeloma experts strongly
encourages people with smoldering myeloma
to enroll in a clinical trial if one is open and is
the right fit.

and assess symptoms. During observation,
you should have follow-up blood tests every 3
to 6 months and whole-body imaging once a
year.

Progression
If smoldering myeloma grows and starts
causing symptoms, that means it has

Reducing bone damage

Supportive care helps manage the
symptoms of myeloma and the

and weaker, a condition called osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis can lead to problems such as
bone pain, bone fractures, and compression
of the spine. Medications are available to
help strengthen bones and reduce the risk of
fractures and pain.

side effects of myeloma treatment.
Supportive care doesn’t treat the
cancer, but it aims to improve your
quality of life.

Bisphosphonates are one type of
medication that can improve bone health.
Bisphosphonates lessen bone pain and help
slow down the destruction of bone caused by
myeloma cells. They’re given as a liquid that’s
injected into a vein (IV infusion).

Supportive care helps improve your quality of
life during and after cancer treatment. The goal
of supportive care is to prevent or manage side
effects and symptoms, like pain and cancerrelated fatigue. It also addresses the mental,
social, and spiritual concerns faced by those
with cancer.

Bisphosphonates for people with multiple
myeloma include pamidronate (Aredia) and
zoledronic acid (Zometa).

Supportive care is available to everyone with
cancer and their families, not just those at the
end of life. Palliative care is another name for
supportive care.

A different type of drug called denosumab
(Xgeva) can also help prevent serious bone
problems in people with multiple myeloma.
Denosumab is given as a shot (injection) under
the skin every 4 weeks.

Supportive care can also help with:


Making treatment decisions



Coordinating your care



Paying for care



NCCN experts recommend that either
bisphosphonates or denosumab be given
to anyone receiving primary treatment for
myeloma. For people whose kidneys don’t
work very well, denosumab is a better choice
than bisphosphonates.

Planning for advanced care and end of
life

Supportive care is an important part of your
overall treatment.

Bisphosphonates and denosumab can cause
side effects such as rotting of the jawbone
in the mouth (osteonecrosis). So it’s very
important to see your dentist before starting
this kind of treatment. It’s also very important
to have good dental care before and during
treatment with these medications.

Here are some ways supportive care can help
with common problems caused by myeloma
and myeloma treatment:

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Multiple Myeloma, 2025

5 Supportive care » Reducing bone damage

Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty

Bone damage can also be painful. You may
receive radiation therapy to relieve this pain.

Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty may be used to
treat compression fractures in the vertebrae. A
compression fracture is a break in a vertebra
caused by the collapse of bones in the spine.
Vertebroplasty involves injecting a special
orthopedic cement into the vertebra. The
cement supports and strengthens the bone for
pain relief and to hold it in place.

To help prevent or treat a bone fracture, you
may be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.
Surgeons can prevent bone fractures by
placing a rod to support the bone and hold it
in place. Surgery may also be used to treat
fractures in the bones of the spine (vertebrae).
Two surgical procedures that may be used are
vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.

Kyphoplasty involves a balloon-like device
that’s placed in the fractured vertebrae and
then inflated. This spreads out the vertebrae
to restore the normal shape and height of
the spine. Then the balloon is removed, and
orthopedic cement is injected to support the
vertebrae and hold them in place.

If you look at a normal bone under a microscope, you’ll see the bone structure is
dense and closely packed together. But a bone that develops osteoporosis loses
density and mass. The structure thins out and leaves large gaps. This weakens
bones, making them more likely to break.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Multiple Myeloma, 2025

44

5 Supportive care » Decreasing kidney damage » Treating anemia

Decreasing kidney damage

Avoiding infections

Myeloma cells cause your bones to break
down, which releases calcium into the
bloodstream. A high level of calcium in the
blood is dangerous for the kidneys. If this
happens, you’ll be treated with IV fluids and
drugs to help your kidneys flush out the excess
calcium.

Myeloma and certain myeloma treatments can
increase your risk of infection. But you can
greatly reduce this risk by getting vaccinated
for infections that are common in people with
myeloma, including pneumonia, the flu, and
COVID-19.
Another infection is shingles, which causes
a painful skin rash. Shingles can be a side
effect of bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, and
daratumumab. If you’re receiving any of these
medicines, you might also be given pills to
prevent shingles.

Very high levels of M proteins can cause the
blood to become very thick. This is called
hyperviscosity. Very thick blood can damage
the kidneys and other organs. Hyperviscosity
can be treated with a process called
plasmapheresis. This treatment filters blood
through a machine to remove the M proteins.

Treating anemia

High levels of abnormal M proteins, including
light chains, can also damage the kidneys.
Free light chains combine with another protein
in the kidneys. This makes the light chains
become too large to pass through the kidneys.
The damage caused by this blockage is
called myeloma kidney. Prompt treatment of
myeloma is required to prevent permanent
kidney damage.

Myeloma cells crowd out the normal blood
cells in the bone marrow. This can cause
anemia—a condition in which the number of
red blood cells is too low. Sometimes anemia
may be treated with a drug that causes your
body make more erythropoietin. Erythropoietin
is a natural hormone that helps the bone
marrow make more red blood cells.

To prevent kidney failure, your care team may
recommend staying hydrated. This means
drinking plenty of fluids, especially water.

If you’re being treated with drugs to increase
erythropoietin, you should have frequent
checkups to test for possible blood clots. You
can read more about anemia at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

You’ll also be told to avoid using certain
medications like NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen
and naproxen) and IV contrast, which is
often given before an imaging test. Your
care team will watch you closely for signs of
kidney damage, especially if you’re taking
bisphosphonates for a long time.

5 Supportive care » Preventing blood clots » Reducing anxiety and depression

Preventing blood clots

Fatigue often has more than one cause. It may
be due to your cancer, your cancer treatment,
another medical condition, or a combination
of these problems. Likewise, fatigue often
requires more than one remedy.

People with myeloma have a much higher
risk of forming blood clots in their bodies,
particularly in the first 6 months after being
newly diagnosed with myeloma. A blood clot
that travels to the lungs, heart, or brain can be
dangerous, even deadly.

Being treated for anemia may be the first step.
Learning how to conserve energy may also
help. If depression is making fatigue worse,
seek counseling and medication. Eating
healthy foods and getting good nutrition is also
important.

Some drugs used for treating myeloma—
particularly carfilzomib, lenalidomide,
pomalidomide, and thalidomide—have a
greater chance of causing blood clots.

Exercise can also lessen fatigue. Plus,
exercise is critical for staying healthy. Almost
every person with myeloma can do some
sort of exercise. You can read more about
fatigue and cancer care at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Blood thinners are medications that thin out
the blood to lower the risk of blood clots.
NCCN experts recommend taking either blood
thinners or aspirin (an anti-platelet drug) while
being treated for myeloma, depending on your
risk of clotting.
You can read more about blood clots and
cancer at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Reducing anxiety and
depression
Anxiety and depression are very common in
people with cancer. These emotions can be
overwhelming. They can leave you feeling
helpless and distressed, and prevent you from
taking part in your daily life.

Fighting fatigue
Fatigue is a common problem for people with
multiple myeloma. Fatigue is tiredness and
lack of energy despite getting enough sleep
and nutrition. It can last for months or even
years.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Multiple Myeloma, 2025

These feelings should not go untreated. If
you’re feeling depressed or anxious, be sure to
ask your treatment team for help.

back.

A relapse is when cancer improves for a while
after treatment, but then it comes back with
new symptoms or organ damage. Sometimes
a relapse is just the reappearance of abnormal
myeloma proteins without any new symptoms.
In any case, most people with multiple
myeloma can expect to have multiple relapses
over the course of their treatment.

Even with the best treatment, sometimes
multiple myeloma doesn’t go away or gets
worse (progression). Or it may get better after
primary treatment, but then it comes back
again (relapse) months or years later.
Although relapses are expected, they aren’t
easy. It’s normal to feel disappointment,
frustration, and hopelessness. Allow yourself
some time to absorb the news and get
adjusted.

A relapse can happen within a few months or
up to years after starting different treatments.
Signs of a myeloma relapse are when M
proteins increase, symptoms come back,
or new symptoms begin. A relapse can
sometimes cause worse symptoms than when
the myeloma first appeared. Worse symptoms
can be a sign of more aggressive cancer.

But also, be aware that there are many other
available therapies for progression and relapse
that are different from your primary treatment.

The fear of having a relapse is likely the most
common psychological difficulty that occurs
after cancer treatment. So stressing out about
a relapse is understandable. If this kind of
stress is bothering you, ask your care team for
help.

What is progression?
Progressive disease means that the myeloma
has remained or has grown even with
treatment. This growth could be indicated by
different test results, such as:

Revisit your preferences
and goals

Joining a clinical trial may be even more
important for someone who has relapsed or
progressive myeloma. Ask your treatment
team how you might be able to join a clinical
trial.

Being faced with progression or relapse can
be a good time to pause and consider your
preferences and goals again.

Medications you haven’t tried

It’s important to have an open and honest
conversation with your team about your goals
for treatment and your treatment plan right
from the time of diagnosis. Think about what
you want from treatment. Weigh your options
and share your concerns with your care team.
In shared decision-making, you and your care
team share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan.

Additional treatment includes medications or
therapies you haven’t already tried or those
you haven’t used for at least 6 months.
A variety of options are available for previously
treated multiple myeloma, depending on
which therapies you’ve already tried and
how well they worked. Preferred multi-drug
combinations for previously treated multiple
myeloma are listed in Guide 7.

Your treatment plan may change because of
new information. Tests may find new results.
How well the treatment is working may

If treatment stops working
Sometimes a treatment doesn’t work against
a person’s cancer. Or the treatment works at
first but then the cancer becomes resistant
to it over time. When resistance happens,
a different medication—or a different
combination of medications—can be tried in
place of the resistant one.

Talk to your treatment team about which
treatment options may be better for you. They
can explain the reasons for choosing one
combination of medications over another.
Some therapies may put you at risk for serious
side effects. Certain medications are stronger
than others and may be harmful to people who
are frail or elderly. Some drugs are given only
after you’ve had 1 or more prior treatments.

For a person with advanced multiple myeloma,
resistance can become a serious problem.
A person’s cancer can become resistant
to several medications or even entire drug
classes. This level of resistance can make it
more difficult to keep the cancer under control.

Your team can discuss the side effects that
may occur. They'll consider these things, along
with the extent of your disease, when working
with you to decide your next treatment.

After you’ve tried at least 3 or 4 therapies, the
next preferred treatment options for relapsed
or resistant multiple myeloma are CAR T-cell
therapy or targeted therapy using bispecific
antibodies. (CAR T-cell therapy may be

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy

CAR T-cell therapy

6 Treatment for progression and relapse » Treatment options for relapse or progression

Follow-up tests

CAR T-cell therapy is a special type of
immunotherapy. It changes some of your
body’s immune cells (T cells) to help them
better find and kill cancer cells.

After you receive treatment for progression or
relapse, you’ll have follow-up tests to see if
the treatment is working or if it’s causing any
side effects. Surveillance is a key part of your
follow-up plan. Be sure to continue to go to
follow-up visits, get tested regularly, and stay
in touch with your treatment team.

To create CAR T cells, immune cells are
first removed from your blood. In a lab, the
cells are modified to grow chimeric antigen
receptors (CARs) on their surface. These
receptors are like hooks that can latch onto
cancer cells.

Supportive care
If tests show progressive disease during or
after additional treatment, then supportive
care is also recommended. Supportive care
(sometimes called palliative care) is given
to relieve the symptoms of cancer and the
side effects of cancer treatment. You can
receive supportive care at any stage. For
specific information about supportive care for
myeloma, see Chapter 5: Supportive care.

Next, these CAR T cells are multiplied in the
lab. At this time, you’ll have a short course of
chemotherapy, which will help the treatment
to work more effectively. Then the CAR T cells
will be infused back into your body. Once in
the blood, the CAR T cells have an improved
ability to identify a specific protein on cancer
cells, latch onto the cancer cells, and then
destroy them.

Other types of supportive care—including
emotional or spiritual support, financial
guidance, and family counseling—may also be
available to you. Read more about supportive
(palliative) care at NCCN.org/patientguidelines
and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer
app.

The two CAR T-cell therapies available for
multiple myeloma are Abecma (idecabtagene
vicleucel) and Carvykti (ciltacabtagene
autoleucel).

Hematopoietic cell transplant
A hematopoietic (blood-forming) cell transplant
may be an option for someone who hasn’t
already had one.
A hematopoietic cell transplant is also
sometimes an option for someone with
relapsed or progressive multiple myeloma who
had a long-lasting remission (usually at least 2
years or more) to an earlier hematopoietic cell
transplant.

6 Treatment for progression and relapse » Survivorship » You’re not alone

Survivorship

Advance care planning starts with an honest
conversation with your doctor and care team.
Ask them about your prognosis—the likely
course your cancer will take. Find out what you
might expect if your cancer spreads. Discuss
the medications or therapies that will give you
the best quality of life. Let them know what
your goals are and what’s most important to
you.

Survivorship focuses on the health and wellbeing of a person with cancer from diagnosis
until the end of life. This includes the physical,
mental, emotional, social, and financial effects
of cancer that begin at diagnosis, continue
through treatment and recovery, and arise
afterward.
Survivorship also includes concerns about
follow-up care, late effects of treatment,
cancer recurrence, age-appropriate preventive
care, and quality of life. Support from family
members, friends, and caregivers is also an
important part of survivorship.

Include family and friends in your advance
care planning. Make your wishes clear. It’s
important that everyone understands what you
want.

You’re not alone

Read more about survivorship at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

Some people have myeloma that eventually
becomes resistant to any therapy. Maybe they
had only a few treatment options available,
and none of them really worked. It’s normal for
someone at this stage to feel many different
emotions, such as disbelief, frustration, fear,
anxiety, or anger—sometimes all at once.
Caregivers and loved ones can also feel these
strong emotions.

Advance care planning

After months or years of tests and treatments,
it can feel defeating if myeloma comes back
again or just won’t go away. It’s not something
that you can prepare for or know exactly how
to deal with.

Advance care planning means making
decisions now about the care you would want
to receive if you became unable to speak or
act for yourself.

But you’re not alone, even though you may
feel that way sometimes. As noted before,
supportive care can help. Supportive care
is not just for relieving symptoms and side
effects. Supportive care specialists can assist
you emotionally, mentally, physically, and
spiritually.

Advance care planning is for everyone, not
just for those who are very sick. It’s a way
to ensure your wishes are understood and
respected. You can change your plan at any
time.

Questions to ask

Also, if you haven’t already joined a support
group, this is a good time to consider joining
one.



If you need more information about supportive
care, reach out to your care team and ask
questions. Some medical centers have
patient navigators or other staff members
who coordinate nonclinical supportive care. If
needed, they can also help you get assistance
with end-of-life concerns and advance care
planning.

What are the chances of my myeloma
worsening or returning?
What symptoms should I report right
away, and who should I contact?
Am I able to have CAR T-cell therapy or
bispecific antibody therapy?
How do you know if my treatment is
working?
What are my options if treatment stops
working?

Progression is when myeloma continues
to grow even after treatment.
A relapse is when symptoms come back
or new symptoms begin after a period of
improvement.
Most people with multiple myeloma can
expect to have relapses.
Because your treatment plan may
change, it’s helpful to have regular
talks with your care team about your
preferences and goals for treatment.

Let us know what
you think!

Drug resistance is when a treatment
doesn’t work or stops working against
