About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Version 1.2022 –
April 4, 2022.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

a group of cells that work together to perform
a function. Blood’s function is to move oxygen
and nutrients throughout the body and carry
away waste. Blood also plays an important
role for the immune system and in preventing
bleeding.

lymphocytes called lymphoblasts.

Your blood contains different types of cells that
float in plasma. Plasma is a clear, yellowish
fluid made up of mostly water. More than half
of your blood is plasma.

Lymphoblasts can crowd out
other blood cells causing blood to
not work as it should. Treatment

ALL basics » Blood

Blood stem cells can copy themselves or “selfrenew.” These cells are rare. The role of blood
stem cells is to make cells that will become red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
These are called progenitor cells or precursor
cells.

Blood cells are being replaced in your body all
the time. Many have a short lifespan. Some
white blood cells live less than one day. Your
body makes one million red blood cells every
second!

How blood cells are formed

There are different types of progenitor cells:

Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue in
the center of most bones. Inside your bone
marrow are early blood-forming cells called
blood (hematopoietic) stem cells. All types of
blood cells are created from blood stem cells.
At any given time, bone marrow will have cells
in various stages of development, from very
immature to almost fully mature. This process
is called differentiation. After a blood stem cell
develops into a red blood cell, white blood cell,
or platelet, it is released in your bloodstream
as needed.

Lymphocytes

Acute lymphoblastic
leukemia

A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell
found in blood and lymph tissue, as well as
all organs in the body. Lymph tissue includes
lymph vessels and lymph nodes. Lymphocytes
help fight and prevent infection.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fastgrowing blood cancer that starts in diseasefighting lymphocytes of your immune system.
In ALL, bone marrow makes too many
immature lymphocytes called lymphoblasts.
Lymphoblasts can crowd out other blood cells
causing blood to not work as it should. Acute
leukemias grow faster than chronic leukemias.

There are 3 main types of lymphocytes:






B lymphocytes or B cells make
antibodies. An antibody is a protein.
T lymphocytes or T cells help fight
infections, kill tumor cells, and control
immune responses.

In general, to be diagnosed with ALL, 20
percent (20%) or more lymphoblasts must
be present in the bone marrow. This means
that at least 1 out of every 5 marrow cells are
lymphoblasts. In certain cases, a diagnosis
of ALL is possible with less than 20%
lymphoblasts.

Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor
cells or virus-infected cells.

ALL most often affects B cells or T cells.

ALL can be found in bone marrow, blood, and
organs such as the testicles or the central
nervous system.

About this book

There are 2 types of ALL:


B cell or B-ALL



T cell or T-ALL

This book applies to AYAs and adults who
are being treated for ALL at an adult cancer
center. An adolescent and young adult (AYA)
is someone 15 to 39 years of age at the time
of initial cancer diagnosis. AYAs are a unique
group that can be treated by pediatric or
adult oncologists in pediatric or adult centers
depending on the type of cancer. This book
applies to those being treated at an adult
cancer center.

Within each type there are several subtypes,
which are based mainly on:




The type of lymphocyte (most often B cell
or T cell) within the leukemia cells and
how mature the cells are. This is known
as the immunophenotype of the leukemia.
If the leukemia cells have specific gene or
chromosome changes.

More information for AYAs seeking ALL
treatment at a pediatric cancer center can be
found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

B-ALL
B-cell ALL or B-ALL starts in B-cell
lymphocytes. B-ALL is more common than
T-ALL. Mature B-cell ALL (also called Burkitt
leukemia), a rare subtype, is essentially
the same as Burkitt lymphoma (a type of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma), but is treated
differently from B-ALL. In some cases, the
B-cell lymphoblasts grow mostly in the lymph
nodes instead of in the bone marrow. When
this happens, it is called B-cell lymphoblastic
lymphoma, B-LL, or B-LBL.

T-ALL
T-cell ALL or T-ALL starts in T-cell
lymphocytes. T-ALL can cause an enlarged
thymus (a small organ in front of the
windpipe), which can sometimes lead to
breathing problems. In some cases, the T-cell
lymphoblasts grow mostly in the thymus
instead of in the bone marrow. When this
happens, it is called T-cell lymphoblastic
lymphoma, T-LL, or T-LBL.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is
a fast-growing blood cancer. In ALL,
bone marrow makes too many immature
lymphocytes called lymphoblasts. This
makes it hard for bone marrow or blood to
do its work.

Those with ALL
should be treated at
experienced cancer
centers.

To be diagnosed with ALL, 20 percent
(20%) or more lymphoblasts must be
present in the bone marrow. This means
that at least 1 out of every 5 marrow cells
are lymphoblasts.
An adolescent and young adult (AYA) is
someone 15 to 39 years of age at the

There is more than one type of ALL. It is
based on the type of lymphocyte, genetic
mutations, and other features.
Those with ALL should be treated at

General health tests
Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
(OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you
take. Some supplements interact and affect
medicines that your care team may prescribe.
Tell your care team about any symptoms you
have. A medical history, sometimes called
a health history, will help determine which
treatment is best for you.

Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports about the specific type of
cancer you have.
Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.

Family history

What is your family
health history?

Some cancers and other diseases can run in
families. Your doctor will ask about the health
history of family members who are blood
relatives. This information is called a family
history. Ask family members on both sides of
your family about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what
age they were diagnosed. It’s important to
know the specific type of cancer, or where the
cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations.
Those with a family history of leukemia,
blood cancer or abnormalities, or certain
genetic mutations might be referred to genetic
counseling.

Some cancers and other diseases run in
families – those who are related to you
through genes passed down from parent
to child. This information is called a family
health history. You can ask family members
about their health issues like heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they
were diagnosed. For relatives who have
died, ask about the cause and age of death.
Start by asking your parents, siblings,
and children. Next, talk to half-siblings,
aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews,
grandparents, and grandchildren.

Ask blood relatives on both sides of your
family about their health issues like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what
age they were diagnosed.

Write down what you learn about your
family history and share with your health
care provider.
Some of the questions to ask include:

•

Do you have any chronic diseases, such
as heart disease or diabetes, or health
conditions such as high blood pressure
or high cholesterol?

•

Have you had any other diseases, such
as cancer or stroke?

•

How old were you when each of these
diseases and health conditions was
diagnosed?

•

What is our family’s ancestry – from
what countries did our ancestors
originate?

Testing for ALL » Blood tests

Blood tests

Comprehensive metabolic panel

Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into a vein. Be
prepared to have many blood tests during ALL
treatment and recovery to check treatment
results, blood counts, and the health of organs
like your liver and kidneys.

A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a
test that measures 14 different substances in
your blood. It is usually done on the plasma
part of your blood. A CMP provides important
information about how well your kidneys and
liver are working, among other things.

Complete blood count and
differential

B12 and folic acid

A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your
blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a picture
of your overall health. ALL often causes low
counts of healthy blood cells.

Vitamin B12 and folic acid (folate) work with
vitamin C to help the body make new proteins.
They are needed for normal red blood cell
(RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) formation.
B12 and folic acid levels will be monitored. You
may be given vitamin supplements, if needed.

There are several types of white blood cells. A
differential counts the number of each type of
white blood cell. It also checks if the counts are
in balance with each other. This test may show
a high number of blasts in the blood.

Blood clotting tests
Your body stops bleeding by turning blood into
a gel-like form. The gel-like blood forms into
a solid mass called a blood clot. Clotting is a
process or series of events. Proteins, called
coagulation factors, are needed for clotting.
They are made by the liver. Blood clottin tests
are known together as a coagulation panel or
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
panel.

Creatinine

It is standard to screen for clotting problems.
An impaired clotting process is common in
leukemia. This is called coagulopathy. You
may have bleeding and bruises.

Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles.
Every person generates a fixed amount of
creatinine every day based on how much
muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood
by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the
blood tells how well the kidneys are working.
Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys
aren’t working as well as they were when
someone had lower levels of creatinine.

Blood urea nitrogen

Electrolytes

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a waste product
filtered out of the blood by the kidneys. A high
level of BUN can be a sign your kidneys aren’t
working well.

Electrolytes help move nutrients into cells
and help move waste out of cells. Electrolytes
are ions or particles with electrical charges
that help the nerves, muscles, heart, and
brain work as they should. Your body needs
electrolytes to function properly. Phosphate

Testing for ALL » Blood tests

Uric acid

(PO4) is important for strong bones and teeth.
Too much phosphate in blood can be a sign
your kidneys aren’t working well.

Uric acid is released by cells when DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) breaks down. It is a
normal waste product that dissolves in your
blood and is filtered by the kidneys where it
leaves the body as urine. Too much uric acid
in the body is called hyperuricemia. With ALL,
it can be caused by a fast turnover of white
blood cells. High uric acid might be a side
effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Very high levels of uric acid in the blood can
damage the kidneys.

Iron
Iron is important in maintaining body functions
such as producing hemoglobin, the molecule
in your blood that carries oxygen. You might
be monitored for low levels of iron called iron
deficiency. You may be given intravenous
(IV) iron supplement, if needed. It is possible
to have too much iron in the body called
overload. Therefore, only take what is
prescribed by your doctor.

HLA typing
A human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a protein
found on the surface of most cells. It plays
an important role in your body’s immune
response. HLAs are unique to each person.
They mark your body’s cells. Your body
detects these markers to tell which cells are
yours. In other words, all your cells have the
same set of HLAs. Each person’s set of HLAs
is called the HLA type or tissue type.

Lactate dehydrogenase
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid
dehydrogenase is a protein found in most
cells. Dying cells release LDH into blood. Fastgrowing cells also release LDH. High levels of
LDH can be a sign of ALL.

Liver function tests

HLA typing is a test that detects a person’s
HLA type. This test is done before a donor
(allogeneic) blood stem cell transplant. To
find a donor match, your proteins will be
compared to the donor’s white blood cells to
see how many proteins are the same. A very
good match is needed for a transplant to be
a treatment option. Otherwise, your body will
reject the donor cells or the donor cells will
react against your body. Blood samples from
you and your blood relatives will be tested first.

Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that are
made or processed by the liver. Levels that
are too high or low signal that the liver is not
working well.

Phosphate
Cells have a lot of phosphate in them.
Therefore, when many cells are breaking down
at the same time, the levels of phosphate in
the blood can go up. Your kidneys help get rid
of extra phosphate, but too much phosphate
in the blood can also damage the kidneys,
making it harder to get the levels back down to
normal.

Testing for ALL » Fertility (all genders) » Preventing pregnancy

Fertility (all genders)

Preventing pregnancy

Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect
your fertility, the ability to have children. If you
think you want children in the future, ask your
care team how cancer and cancer treatment
might change your fertility. To preserve your
fertility, you may need to take action before
starting cancer treatment. Those who want to
have children in the future should be referred
to a fertility specialist to discuss the options
before starting treatment.

Preventing pregnancy during treatment is
important. Cancer and cancer treatment
can affect the ovaries and damage sperm.
Hormonal birth control may or may not be
recommended, so ask your doctor about
options such as intrauterine devices (IUDs)
and barrier methods. Types of barrier methods
include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps,
and the contraceptive sponge.

Those with ovaries

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your
options open, whether you know you want
to have children later in life or aren’t really
sure at the moment. Fertility and reproductive
specialists can help you sort through what may
be best for your situation.

Those who can become pregnant will have
a pregnancy test before starting treatment.
Cancer treatment can hurt the developing
baby if you are or become pregnant during
treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent
pregnancy during and after treatment is
recommended. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding at the time of your cancer
diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be
avoided.

More information on fertility preservation in
adolescents and young adults can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your
“period” may stop during treatment, but often
returns within 2 years after treatment in those
35 years of age and under. It is still possible
to become pregnant even though you might
not have a period. Therefore, birth control is
recommended during and after treatment.
Consult your doctor for the best time to plan a
pregnancy.

Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your fertility to be
temporarily or permanently impaired or
interrupted. This temporary loss of fertility
is related to your age at time of diagnosis,
treatment type(s), treatment dose, and
treatment length. Talk to your care team
about your concerns and if you are planning a
pregnancy.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Those with testicles
Cancer and cancer treatment can damage
sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth
control) such as condoms to prevent
pregnancy during and immediately after cancer
treatment.

Testing for ALL » Tissue tests

Tissue tests

Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding
liquid and cells. An aspirate takes some of the
liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy
takes a piece of the sponge.

An aspirate or a biopsy is the removal of a
sample of tissue or group of cells for testing.
A diagnosis of ALL is confirmed using a bone
marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy.

For many, this is a painful procedure. Your
care team will try to make you as comfortable
as possible. The samples are usually taken
from the back of the hip bone (pelvis). You will
likely lie on your belly or side. For an aspirate,
a hollow needle will be pushed through your
skin and into the bone. Liquid bone marrow will
then be drawn into a syringe. For the biopsy,
a wider needle will be used to remove a core
sample. You may feel bone pain at your hip for
a few days. Your skin may bruise.

Bone marrow tests
Leukemia starts in the bone marrow. To
diagnose ALL, samples of bone marrow must
be removed and tested before starting any
treatment. Your sample should be reviewed by
a pathologist who is an expert in the diagnosis
of ALL. This review is often referred to as
histology, histopathology, or hematopathology
review. The pathologist will note the overall
appearance and the size, shape, and type of
your cells.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry is a laboratory method used to
detect, identify, and count specific cells. Flow
cytometry involves adding a light-sensitive dye
to cells. The dyed cells are passed through
a beam of light in a machine. The machine

predisposition condition is important.

measures the number of cells, things like the
size and shape of the cells, and other unique
features of cells.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup). The goal is to look for
gene mutations inherited from your biological
parents called germline mutations. Some
mutations can put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. You can pass these genes
on to your children. Also, family members
might carry these mutations. Tell your care
team if there is a family history of cancer.

A complete blood test can count the number
of white blood cells, but it cannot detect the
subtle differences between different types
of blood cancers. Immunophenotyping
can detect these subtle differences. Flow
cytometry can detect these subtle differences.
The most common use of flow cytometry
is in the identification of markers on cells,
particularly in the immune system (called
immunophenotyping).

A genetic risk assessment will identify if you
carry a cancer risk and if you may benefit
from genetic testing, additional screening, or
preventive interventions. Depending on the
genetic risk assessment, you might undergo
genetic testing and genetic counseling.

Immunophenotyping
Immunophenotyping uses antibodies to
detect the presence or absence of white
blood cell antigens called biomarkers. These
antigens are proteins that can be found on the
surface of or inside white blood cells. Certain
biomarkers are targeted in ALL treatment.

Leukemia predisposition
syndromes
A family history of leukemia can affect
treatment. A skin punch biopsy might be done
if a predisposition condition is suspected. If
your blood was tested at diagnosis, you would
see the genetic changes of the leukemia.
Therefore, a skin punch biopsy is used. In
this procedure, a small piece of skin and
connective tissue is removed to get DNA that
hasn’t been altered by ALL. This will be used
to see if you inherited genes that increase
your risk of leukemia. Leukemia predisposition
syndrome can affect how your body responds
to treatment. Blood and saliva can be used
when ALL cells disappear (in remission).
Biological family members who are possible
hematopoietic cell donors might be tested for
leukemia predisposition syndrome.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
staining process that involves adding a
chemical marker to cells. The cells are then
studied using a microscope.

Genetic risk testing
You might be thinking why did I get cancer?
Most of the time, the answer is one cell made
a mistake when dividing and then a cancer
formed. Some, however, have a predisposition
or have something in their DNA (genetic
material) that makes them more likely to
develop cancer. Understanding whether you
have a cancer predisposition condition can
sometimes affect your cancer treatment, but
more often, it can affect screening for other

cancer is different than genetic testing done
specifically on cancer cells or testing to look
for proteins produced by cancer cells.

Mutations
ALL cells can have changes in genes and
chromosomes. Mutation testing looks for these
changes or abnormalities that are unique to
ALL cells. Examples of such changes are called
deletion, insertion, amplification, translocation
(rearrangement), and point mutation.

Genetic and biomarker
testing
Genetic and biomarker tests are used to
learn more about your type of ALL, to target
treatment, and to determine the likely path
your cancer will take (prognosis). This
genetic testing is different from family history
genetic testing. ALL genetic testing looks for
changes only in the leukemia cells that have
developed over time, and not changes in the
rest of your body’s cells. Biomarker testing
includes tests of genes or their products
(proteins) and identifies the presence or
absence of mutations and certain proteins.
It is sometimes called molecular testing,
tumor profiling, gene expression profiling, or
genomic testing.

3 Amplification – When a part or whole
chromosome or gene is increased
(for example, duplicated) such as
intrachromosomal amplification of
chromosome 21 (iAMP21)

3 Deletion – When part of a chromosome or
gene is missing such as PTEN of IKZF1

3 Insertion – When a new part of a
chromosome or gene is included

3 Inversion – Switching of parts within one

Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) molecules. These molecules
are tightly packaged into what is called
a chromosome. Chromosomes contain
most of the genetic information in a cell.
Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
Each chromosome contains thousands of
genes. Genes are coded instructions for
the proteins your cells make. Most genes
contain information about a specific protein.
A mutation is when something goes wrong
in the genetic code. Proteins are written like
this: BCR. Genes are written in italics like
this: BCR

chromosome

3 Point mutation – When part of a gene is
changed

3 Chromosome translocation and

gene rearrangement – Switching of
parts between 2 chromosomes. When
described at the chromosome level, it is
called a translocation. When described at
the gene level, it is called rearrangement.
For example, the chromosome translocation
is written as t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1) and
its gene rearrangement is written as
ETV6::RUNX1.

ALL cells sometimes have changes in genes
and chromosomes that can be seen under a
microscope or found with other tests.

ALL mutation testing

PCR

A sample of your blood or bone marrow will
be studied to see if the ALL cancer cells have
any specific mutations. This is separate from
the genetic testing for mutations that you may
have inherited from your biological parents.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab
process that can make millions or billions
of copies of one's DNA or RNA (genetic
information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find
1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000
normal cells. These copies, called PCR
product, might be used for next-generation
sequencing (NGS). This is important when
testing for treatment response or remission.
A real-time or reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR)
PCR is used to look for gene rearrangements
such as BCR::ABL1

ALL cells can have changes in genes and
chromosomes. Mutation testing using
methods such as karyotype, fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), and next-generation
sequencing (NGS) are used to look for these
changes or abnormalities. Some mutations
may determine the type of treatment given.

Next-generation sequencing

Karyotype

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a
method used to determine a portion of a
person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene
has any mutations that might affect how the
gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more
detailed way than other methods, and can find
mutations that other methods might miss.

A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes.
Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of
chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes.
A karyotype will show extra, missing
(deletion), translocated, or abnormal pieces
of chromosomes. Since a karyotype requires
growing cells, a sample of bone marrow or
blood must be used.

Translocations and
rearrangements

FISH

Translocation is a switching of parts between
two chromosomes. If this is explained at
the gene level, it is called rearrangement.
The Philadelphia chromosome occurs with
translocation between chromosomes 9 and
22 and is written as t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) in the
chromosome level and BCR::ABL1 in the gene
level. The detailed explanation is shown in the
image on the next page.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
a method that involves special dyes called
probes that attach to pieces of DNA. FISH can
look for mutations that are too small to be seen
with other methods. It can only be used for
known changes. Since this test doesn’t need
growing cells, it can be performed on either a
bone marrow or blood sample. Sometimes, a
bone marrow sample is needed to get all the
information the care team needs to help plan
your treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Other common translocations in ALL include
t(v;11q23.3) written as KMT2A-rearranged
and t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1) written as
ETV6::RUNX1.

20

Testing for ALL » Genetic and biomarker testing

Philadelphia chromosome
In the Philadelphia chromosome, a piece of
chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome
22 break off and trade places with each
other. These pieces create a new, abnormal
chromosome 22 that contains a small part
of chromosome 9. This new, abnormal
chromosome 22 is referred to as the
Philadelphia chromosome. You might see it
written as Ph-positive (Ph+).

Testing takes time. It
might take days or
weeks before all test
results come in.

Chromosomes have many genes. One piece
of chromosome 9 contains a gene called
ABL1. One piece of chromosome 22 contains
a gene called BCR. When these genes
fuse together on chromosome 22, a new
BCR::ABL1 gene is formed. This translocation
is also shown as t(9;22). BCR::ABL1 makes
a new protein that leads to uncontrolled cell
growth. BCR::ABL1 is not found in normal
blood cells. It is not passed down from
biological parents to children.

Imaging tests

one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture.
A CT of the brain is used to look for bleeding.
Contrast should not be used.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of one's
body to look for sites with leukemia. Leukemia
can spread outside the bloodstream to lymph
nodes, liver, spleen, and skin. It rarely spreads
to the lining of the brain and spinal cord.
Imaging tests can also show areas of infection
or bleeding, which may impact your care.

Brain MRI
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of the inside of the body. It
does not use x-rays. A device will be placed
around your head that sends and receives
radio waves. An MRI can show if the outer
layer of the brain is swollen. Swelling caused
by leukemia is called leukemic meningitis.
Contrast should be used.

A radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging
tests, will write a report and send this report to
your doctor. The doctor will discuss the results
with you. While these reports are available to
you through your portal, please wait to discuss
these results with the doctor.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where
the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has
a magnet top and bottom, which allows for
an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are
more common than open MRIs, so if you have
claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed
spaces), be sure to talk to your care team
about it. Also, tell your doctor if there is any
metal in your body.

Contrast material
Contrast material is used to improve the
pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast
materials are not dyes, but substances that
help enhance and improve the images of
several organs and structures in the body.
It is used to make the pictures clearer.
Contrast might be taken by mouth (oral) or
given through a vein (IV). The contrast is not
permanent and will leave the body in one’s
urine after the test. The types of contrast vary
and are different for CT and MRI.

PET scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan
uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A
tracer is a substance injected into a vein to
see where cancer cells are in the body and if
they are using sugar produced by your body
to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots
on PET scans because they use sugar more
quickly than other cells. However, not all
cancer cells will appear on a PET scan. Also,
not all bright spots are cancer. It is normal
for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to
be bright on PET. Inflammation or infection
can also show up as a bright spot. When a
PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a
PET-CT scan. It may be done with one or two
machines depending on the cancer center.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past, especially
to iodine or shellfish like shrimp. This is
important. You might be given medicines to
avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy
or if your kidneys aren’t working well.

Brain CT
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make

Testing for ALL » Lumbar puncture

Lumbar puncture

During a spinal tap, you will be lying down or
sitting on an exam table. If lying down, your
knees must be tucked up near your chest.
If sitting, you must lean forward toward your
knees. The lower part of your back over your
spine will be numbed. Next, a thin needle will
be inserted between your spinal bones. You
may feel some pressure. After the sample is
taken, it will be sent to a lab for testing.

Leukemia can travel to the fluid that surrounds
the spine or brain. This may cause symptoms.
In order to know if leukemia cells are in your
spinal fluid, a sample must be taken and tested
to rule out a central nervous system (CNS)
disease.
A lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure that
removes spinal fluid. It is also called a spinal
tap. A lumbar puncture may also be used to
inject cancer drugs into spinal fluid. This is
called intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy.

Testing for ALL » Heart tests

Heart tests

MUGA

Heart or cardiac tests are used to see how well
your heart works. These tests might be used
to monitor treatment side effects. You might be
referred to a cardiologist.

A multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan is used
to evaluate the pumping function of your heart.
During the test, a small amount of radiotracer
is injected into a vein. A special camera,
called a gamma camera, will create computergenerated movie images of your beating heart.

Electrocardiogram

MUGA scan might show low ejection fraction.
This is when the amount of blood pumping
from the left side of the heart is lower than
normal.

An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows
electrical changes in your heart. It reveals
information about your heart rate and rhythm.
Prolonged corrected QT interval (or QTc)
occurs when your heart muscle takes longer
than normal to recharge between beats.
Often, this electrical disturbance can be seen
on an ECG. Certain treatments for ALL can
cause prolonged QTc. If the QTc becomes
too prolonged, it can cause dangerous heart
rhythms.

Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram (or echo) uses sound
waves to make pictures. For this test, small
patches will be placed on your chest to
track your heartbeat. Next, a wand (called a
transducer) with gel on its tip will be slid across
part of your bare chest. A picture of your
beating heart will be seen on a screen. The
pictures will be recorded for future viewing.
An echocardiogram is one way of measuring
ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood
pumped out of the left side of your heart every
time it beats. In low ejection fraction, the
amount of blood pumping from the left side of
the heart is lower than normal.



overview of the types of treatment
and what to expect. Not everyone



will receive the same treatment.



Care team


Treating ALL takes a team approach.
Treatment decisions should involve a
multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a
team of health care and psychosocial care
professionals from different professional
backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise)
and experience in your type of cancer.
This team is united in the planning and
implementing of your treatment. Ask who will
coordinate your care.



Some members of your care team will be with
you throughout cancer treatment, while others
will only be there for parts of it. Get to know
your care team and help them get to know you.



Depending on your diagnosis, the care team
might include the following:










A diagnostic radiologist interprets the
results of x-rays and other imaging tests.
An interventional radiologist
performs needle biopsies and places
intravenous (IV) ports for treatment.

A medical oncologist treats cancer in
adults using systemic therapy.
A radiation oncologist prescribes and
delivers radiation therapy to treat cancer.
Residents and fellows are doctors
who are continuing their training, some
to become specialists in a certain field of
medicine.
Nurse practitioners (NPs) and
physician assistants (PAs) are health
care providers. Some of your clinic visits
may be done by a nurse practitioner or
physician assistant.
Oncology nurses provide your
hands-on care, like giving systemic
therapy, managing your care, answering
questions, and helping you cope with side
effects.
Oncology pharmacists are experts
in knowing how to use medicines to treat
cancer and to manage symptoms and
side effects.
Palliative care nurses, advanced
practice providers (APPs), and
physicians help provide an extra layer of
support with cancer-related care.
Nutritionists and dietitians can
provide guidance on what foods are most
suitable for your condition.
Psychologists and psychiatrists
are mental health experts who can help
manage issues such as depression,
anxiety, or other mental health conditions
that can affect how you think and feel.

Treatment overview

Social workers help people solve and
cope with problems in their everyday
lives. Clinical social workers also
diagnose and treat mental, behavioral,
and emotional issues. The anxiety a
person feels when diagnosed with cancer
might be managed by a social worker
in some cancer centers. They, or other
designated professionals, can help
navigate the complexities of financial and
insurance stresses.

ALL is not treated the same for everyone.
As the body ages, it can have difficulty
tolerating higher doses or more intense cancer
treatments. In addition to age, your overall
health, general level of fitness (performance
status), and genetic risk play a role in
treatment decisions. Some cancers are treated
more aggressively than others. An intensive
therapy might have more side effects or be of
a higher dose than a less intensive therapy.
An intensive therapy is not necessarily better.
Remission or a complete response is still
possible in lower-intensity treatments.

A research team helps to collect
research data and coordinate care if
you are in a clinical trial. Clinical trials
help bring new therapies to patients and
advance the treatment for everyone.
Consider asking your care team about
access to clinical trials.

There are always risks with treatment. Talk
with your care team about the risks and why a
treatment might be better for you. Find out how
treatment might affect the quality and length of
life. Your preferences about treatment are also
important.

Your physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing are important. Help other team members
understand:

Central venous access device (CVAD)



Peripheral intravenous line (PIV)

You will likely get either a catheter or a port to
deliver chemotherapy and other treatments. A
catheter is a thin, long tube that is often placed
in the chest. This goes into a large vein and
stays there until treatment is complete. A port
is a small, round disc that is usually placed in
the chest.

28

Treating ALL » Treatment overview

CVAD

PICC

A central venous access device (CVAD) and
central venous catheter (CVC or central line)
are devices inserted into the body through
a vein. This makes it easier to give fluids,
blood products, medicine, and other therapies
directly into the bloodstream. While generally
safe, there are risks for infection and blood
clots. The device may be a catheter (examples
include Hickman and Broviac) or port (porta-cath or mediport). Ask which option is best
based on the treatment you will be receiving.

A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC
or PICC line) is a long, thin tube that’s inserted
through a vein in the arm or leg and passed
through to the larger veins near the heart.

PIV
A peripheral intravenous line (PIV) is a small,
short plastic catheter that is placed through
the skin into a vein, usually in the hand, elbow,
or foot. A PIV can be used to give fluids,
medicines, and certain chemotherapies.

A central venous catheter (CVC) is a thin, long
tube that is often placed in the chest and goes
into a large vein, such as the neck (jugular)
veins or the veins under the collarbone
(subclavian). The part of the CVC used to
attach to fluids or medicine is visible outside of
the body at all times.

Warnings about herbal
supplements and drug
interactions
You might be asked to stop taking or avoid
certain herbal supplements when on a
systemic therapy. Some supplements can
affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This is
called a drug interaction. It is critical to speak
with your care team about any supplements
you may be taking.

A port is a small, round disc that is usually
placed in the chest, with a catheter underneath
the skin that goes from the disc to a large vein,
such as the neck (jugular) veins or the veins
under the collarbone (subclavian). When the
port is needed to give fluids or medications,
a needle is placed through the skin on the
chest to “access” the port. Once the fluid or
medication has been given, the needle is
removed (“deaccessed”) and the port just
looks like a bump underneath the skin.

Some examples include:

Both devices are inserted during a minor
surgery and remain in the body until treatment
is complete. Once the CVC or port-a-cath is
removed, the skin will heal. There may be a
scar.

drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking.
Bring a list with you to every visit.



Steroids



All ALL treatments include steroids. Steroid
is the short name for corticosteroid. Steroids
are human-made versions of hormones
made by the adrenal glands. The adrenal
glands are small structures found near the
kidneys, which help regulate blood pressure
and reduce inflammation. Steroids also are
toxic to lymphoid cells and are an important
part of pediatric ALL chemotherapy. Steroids
can cause short-term and long-term side
effects. The type of steroids used to treat ALL
are called corticosteroids or glucocorticoids.
Corticosteroids are not the same as the
steroids used by some athletes.



Steroids can cause short- and long-term side
effects. Ask your care team about possible
side effects.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the standard of care for
treating ALL. Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing
cells throughout the body, including cancer
cells. You will be monitored throughout
treatment for side effects or other unwanted
(adverse) reactions. All chemotherapy drugs
may cause severe, life-threatening, or fatal
reactions.



Intrathecal (IT) – given into the
spinal fluid. In addition to other forms of
chemotherapy, everyone with pediatric
ALL will have chemotherapy injected into
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to kill any
leukemia cells that might have spread to
the brain and spinal cord. This treatment
is given through a lumbar puncture (spinal
tap).

There are many types of chemotherapy
used to treat ALL. Often chemotherapies
are combined. This is called multiagent
chemotherapy or a multiagent regimen.
Each chemotherapy works to kill cancer
cells in a different way, which helps prevent
the cancer from coming back. Each type of
chemotherapy can also cause different side
effects. Talk to the care team about the types
of chemotherapy you are getting, when you will
get them, and what side effects to expect.

Oral (PO) – taken by mouth either as a
liquid or pill
Subcutaneous (SQ) – given under the
skin

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

IV (intravenous) infusion – given
through a vein using IV push, gravity
infusion, or infusion pump. In an IV
push, a drug is injected quickly over a
few minutes. With a gravity infusion,
medicine is put into a bag that hangs
on a pole, and the pressure of gravity
delivers the medicine into the IV line at
a safe and steady rate. In an IV infusion,
chemotherapy flows through a tube
attached to the catheter. The flow may
be controlled by a machine called an IV
pump. Most IV chemotherapy is given
through a port, CVC, or PICC, but some
can be given through PIVs.

Types of chemotherapy

Chemotherapy can be given as follows:


Intramuscular (IM) – uses a needle to
inject medicine in the muscle of the arm
or leg (like the flu shot)

30

Treating ALL » Targeted therapy

Targeted therapy

For examples of the main types of
chemotherapy drugs (agents) used to treat
ALL, see Guide 2.

Targeted therapy is a form of systemic therapy
that focuses on specific or unique features of
cancer cells. Targeted therapies seek out how
cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the
body. These drugs stop the action of molecules
that help cancer cells grow and/or survive.

Other types of chemotherapy may be used
depending on your type of leukemia and how
ALL responds to therapy.

You will be monitored throughout treatment
for side effects or other unwanted (adverse)
reactions. As with other systemic therapies,
targeted therapy may cause severe, lifethreatening, or fatal reactions.

• Ruxolitinib (Jakafi)

A tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a type of
targeted therapy that blocks the signals that
cause cancer to grow and spread. TKIs might
be used alone or in combination with other
systemic therapies like chemotherapy.
Tyrosine kinases are proteins in cells that are
important for many cell functions. The protein
made by the BCR::ABL1 gene is a tyrosine
kinase. It moves or transfers chemicals,
called phosphates, from one molecule to
another. TKIs block this transfer, which stops
uncontrolled cell growth in ALL.
TKIs are slightly different from one another,
but they generally work in a similar way.
They may cause different side effects. You
might not be given a certain TKI if you have
a health condition, such as lung or heart
issues, or certain ALL-related mutations.

Immunotherapy

CD19-targeting CAR T-cell
therapy

The immune system is the part of the body
that fights infection. Our immune system
also is supposed to attack cancer cells when
they first develop. Sometimes cancer cells
escape the natural defense of our immune
system. Immunotherapy is drug therapy
that acts like your immune system. Some
types of immunotherapy can increase the
activity of your immune system. By doing
so, it improves your body’s ability to find and
destroy cancer cells. Other types of immune
therapy are drugs that work similarly to our
immune system. Immunotherapy can be given
alone or with other types of treatment. As with
other treatments, there is the potential for
complications and life-threatening reactions.

CD19-directed genetically modified autologous
T-cell immunotherapy (CD19-targeting CAR
T-cell therapy) or anti-CD19 CAR T-cell
therapy is made from your own T cells. T cells
will be removed from your body, and in the
lab, a CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) will be
added to them. This programs the T cells to
find cancer cells. The programmed T cells will
be infused back into your body to find and kill
cancer cells. Not everyone will need this type
of treatment.
Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) and
Brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus) are a
type of CD19-targeting CAR T-cell therapy.
More information on CAR T-cell therapy can be
found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on
the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Antibody therapy
Antibody therapy uses antibodies to help the
body fight cancer, infection, or other diseases.
Antibodies are proteins made by the immune
system that bind to specific markers on cells or
tissues. There are different types of antibody
therapy. One type is called monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs). mAbs used in cancer
treatment may kill cancer cells directly, block
development of tumor blood vessels, or help
the immune system kill cancer cells. Other
types of antibody therapy include bispecific
T-cell engagers (BiTEs). BiTEs connect cancer
cells to normal immune cells to improve the
way normal immune cells fight the cancer.



Blinatumomab (Blincyto) allows
normal T cells to attack cancerous B
cells by bringing them close together.
Blinatumomab is a BiTE.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) binds
to CD22 on leukemia cells then releases
a toxic agent once it’s inside the cells.

Radiation therapy

Phases

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy
radiation from photons, electrons, x-rays, or
protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells
and shrink tumors. It is given over a certain
period of time. Radiation therapy can be given
alone or with certain systemic therapies. It may
be used as supportive care to help ease pain
or discomfort caused by cancer.






Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.




Those with leukemia in the central
nervous system may receive radiation
to the brain area called cranial
irradiation. The areas of the brain
targeted for ALL radiation treatment are
different from areas targeted for brain
metastases of solid tumors.



Those with testicular disease may receive
radiation to the testes called testicular
irradiation.



Total body irradiation (TBI) is
radiation of the whole body given before
bone marrow transplant.

Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.
Phase III trials test the drug or
approach against a standard treatment. If
the results are good, it may be approved
by the FDA.
Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Who can enroll?
Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

Clinical trials
A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of treating
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent
Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Phase I trials study the dose, safety,

Treating ALL » Hematopoietic cell transplant

Hematopoietic cell
transplant

This is called engraftment. It usually takes
about 2 to 4 weeks. Until then, you will have
little or no immune defense. You may need to
stay in a very clean room at the hospital or be
given antibiotics to prevent or treat infection.
Transfusions are also possible. A red blood cell
transfusion is used to prevent bleeding and
to treat anemia (below normal red blood cell
count). A platelet transfusion is used to treat
a low platelet count or bleeding. While waiting
for the cells to engraft, you will likely feel tired
and weak.

A hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) replaces
hematopoietic stem cells that have been
destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/
or radiation therapy as part of the transplant
process. A hematopoietic stem cell is an
immature cell that can develop into any type of
blood cell. You might hear it called a stem cell
transplant (SCT) or a bone marrow transplant
(BMT). This book will refer to it as HCT. HCTs
are performed in specialized centers.

Possible side effects

There are 2 types of HCTs:




Every treatment has side effects. You will be
monitored for infections, disease relapse, and
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In GVHD,
the donor cells attack your normal, healthy
tissue. There are treatments for GVHD. Ask
your care team about the possible side effects
or complications of HCT and how this might
affect your quality and of life.

Autologous – stem cells come from
you.
Allogeneic – stem cells come from a
donor who may or may not be related to
you. Only an allogeneic HCT is used as a
possible treatment in ALL.

Allogeneic transplant

More information on GVHD can be found at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

An allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(alloHCT) uses healthy stem cells from a
donor. The donor may or may not be related
to you. Before an HCT, treatment is needed
to destroy bone marrow cells. This is called
conditioning and it creates room for the healthy
donor stem cells. It also weakens the immune
system so your body won’t kill the transplanted
cells. Chemotherapy is used for conditioning.
Radiation therapy may also be given as part of
conditioning treatment.
After conditioning, you will receive a
transfusion of the healthy stem cells from a
donor matched to you. A transfusion is a slow
injection of blood products into a vein. This
can take several hours. The transplanted
stem cells will travel to your bone marrow
and grow. New, healthy blood cells will form.

Treating ALL » Supportive care overview

Supportive care overview

Late effects

Supportive care will be specific to your needs.
Supportive care is health care that relieves
symptoms caused by cancer or its treatment
and improves quality of life. It might include
pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual
support, financial aid, or family counseling. Tell
your care team how you are feeling and about
any side effects so they can be managed. Best
supportive care, supportive care, and palliative
care are often used interchangeably.

Late effects are side effects that occur months
or years after a disease is diagnosed or after
treatment has ended. Late effects may be
caused by cancer or cancer treatment. They
may include physical, mental, and social
problems, and second cancers. The sooner
late effects are treated the better. Ask your
care team about what late effects could occur.
This will help you know what to look for.

Survivorship

It is very important to take care of yourself by
eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising,
and doing things that make you feel energized.
Strength is needed to sustain you during
treatment. Some potential side effects and
procedures are described next. They are not
listed in order of importance. Some side effects
are very rare.

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of
diagnosis until the end of life. When treatment
leads to remission (or no evidence of disease),
you will need follow-up or survivorship care for
late effects. During survivorship care you will
still have a care team, but it will look different.
Seek out peer support groups, whether online
or in-person.

Side effects
All cancer treatments can cause unwanted
health issues called side effects. Side effects
depend on many factors. These factors include
the drug type and dose, length of treatment,
and the person. Some side effects may
be harmful to your health. Others may just
be unpleasant. ALL treatment can cause a
number of side effects. Some are very serious.

It is important to tell
the care team about all
side effects so they can
be managed.

Ask for a complete list of side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your treatment team
about any new or worsening symptoms. There
may be ways to help you feel better. There are
also ways to prevent some side effects. You
will be monitored closely for side effects.

Keep a pain diary

Anemia, neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia

A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain,
how bad it is, what causes it, and what
makes it better or worse. Use a pain diary
to discuss your pain with your care team.
You might be referred to a specialist for
pain management.

Some cancer treatments can cause low blood
cell counts.






Anemia is a condition where your body
does not have enough healthy blood cells,
resulting in less oxygen being carried to
your cells. You might tire easily if you are
anemic.

Include in your pain diary:

Neutropenia is a decrease in
neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
This puts you at risk for infection.

Thrombocytopenia is a condition
where there are not enough platelets
found in the blood. This puts you at risk
for bleeding.

Blood clots
Cancer treatment can cause blood clots to
form. This can block blood flow and oxygen
in the body. Blood clots can break loose and
travel to other parts of the body causing stroke
or other problems.

Cytokine release syndrome
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a
condition that may occur after treatment
with some types of immunotherapy, such
as monoclonal antibodies and CAR T cells.
It is caused by a large, rapid release of
cytokines from immune cells affected by the
immunotherapy. Signs and symptoms of
CRS include fever, muscle aches, nausea,
headache, rash, fast heartbeat, low blood
pressure, and trouble breathing.

treatment. Let your care team know how you
are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of
doing the things you enjoy. Eating a balanced
diet and physical activity can help. You might
be referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help
with fatigue.

Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell you how to
manage diarrhea. It is important to drink lots of
fluids.

Difficulty eating

Hand-foot syndrome

Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer,
or its treatment might cause you to feel not
hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated).
You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating
is important during treatment. It includes eating
a balanced diet, eating the right amount of
food, and drinking enough fluids. A registered
dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food
can help. Speak to your care team if you have
trouble eating or maintaining weight.

Hand-foot syndrome is a common side
effect of chemotherapy. Small amounts of
chemotherapy leak out of very small blood
vessels called capillaries in the palms of the
hands and soles of the feet. It causes redness,
swelling, and pain. Sometimes blisters appear.
You will want to protect your hands and feet by
applying moisturizer or lotion.

High blood pressure

Distress

High blood pressure (HBP or hypertension)
occurs when the force of blood flowing
through your blood vessels is consistently too
high. This can cause headaches and vision
problems. If left untreated, HPB can cause
heart problems and stroke. Steroids can cause
HBP. Medicine might be used to control HBP.

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping problems
are common and are a normal part of cancer
diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with
those whom you feel most comfortable about
how you may be feeling. There are services,
people, and medicine that can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

High blood sugar

Fatigue

One possible side effect of steroids is high
blood sugar or hyperglycemia. Glucose (sugar
found in the blood) will be measured. Insulin
might be needed to control high blood sugar.

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to
function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may be
caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of

Treating ALL » Side effects

Hypersensitivity, allergy, and
anaphylaxis

Neurocognitive or
neuropsychological effects

Certain treatments can cause an unwanted
reaction. Hypersensitivity is an exaggerated
response by the immune system to a drug or
other substance. This can include hives, skin
welts, and trouble breathing. An allergy is an
immune reaction to a substance that normally
is harmless or would not cause an immune
response in most people. An allergic response
may cause harmful symptoms such as itching
or inflammation (swelling). Anaphylaxis or
anaphylactic shock is a severe and possible
life-threatening allergic reaction.

Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration, memory, and thinking. Survivors
are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be
recommended for neuropsychological testing.
Neuropsychology looks at how the health of
your brain affects your thinking and behavior.
Neuropsychological testing can identify your
limits and a health care professional can
create a plan to help with these limits.

Infection

Neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness in different parts of the body. It
usually begins in the hands or feet and gets
worse over time. Neuropathy may be caused
by cancer or cancer treatment. Most of the
time, neuropathy goes away after treatment.

Neuropathy

Infections occur more frequently and are more
severe in those with a weakened immune
system. Drug treatment for ALL can weaken
the body’s natural defense against infections. If
not treated early, infections can be fatal.
Neutropenia, a low number of white blood
cells, can lead to frequent or severe infections.
When someone with neutropenia also
develops a fever, it is called febrile neutropenia
(FN). With FN, your risk of infection may be
higher than normal. This is because a low
number of white blood cells leads to a reduced
ability to fight infections. FN is a side effect of
some types of systemic therapy.

Neurotoxicity
Some treatments can damage the nervous
system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with
concentration and memory. Seizures and
confusion can occur. If ALL treatment includes
methotrexate, then you will be monitored
for methotrexate neurotoxicity (MTX).
Neurotoxicity, such as seizures and confusion,
can be seen with immunotherapy, as well.

Nausea and vomiting

Organ issues

Nausea and vomiting are common side effects
of treatment. You will be given medicine to
prevent nausea and vomiting.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Treatment might cause your kidneys, liver,
heart, and pancreas to not work as well as
they should.

Treating ALL » Side effects

Osteonecrosis
Osteonecrosis, or avascular necrosis, is death
of bone tissue due to lack of blood supply. It
is a possible side effect of steroids and most
often affects weight-bearing joints, such as the
hip and/or knee.

Transfusions

Pain
Tell your care team about any pain or
discomfort. You might meet with a pediatric
pain or palliative care specialist to manage
pain. Bone pain and vincristine-associated
neuropathic pain are common in ALL.

A transfusion is a common procedure to
replace blood or blood components (red
blood cells or platelets). It is given through
an intravenous line (IV), a tiny tube that is
inserted into a vein with a small needle.

Pneumonia

3 The whole process can take about 1 to

4 hours, depending on how much blood
is needed

Pneumocystis pneumonia is a serious infection
caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Since those with ALL are at high risk, medicine
will be given throughout treatment to prevent
this type of pneumonia.

3 Most transfusions use blood from a
donor. This is preferred in ALL.

3 Blood transfusions are usually very

Tumor lysis syndrome

safe. Donated blood is carefully tested,
handled, and stored.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) causes an
imbalance of substances in blood. There
are different treatments for TLS. Treatment
depends on what substances are out of
balance and how well your kidneys are
working. Sometimes, TLS can cause too
much potassium in your blood. Treatment
might include hemodialysis or hemofiltration. A
machine will filter your blood.

3 Most people's bodies handle blood

transfusions very well. But, like any
medical procedure, there are some
risks. Speak with your care team for
specific information about the risks.

3 Systemic therapy can affect how bone
marrow makes new blood cells. Some
people getting treatment for cancer
might need a transfusion of red blood
cells or platelets.

Weight gain
Weight gain is one side effect of high-dose
steroids. This can be uncomfortable and cause
distress. It is important to maintain muscle
mass. Find a physical activity you enjoy. Ask
your care team what can be done to help
manage weight gain.

Treating ALL » Supportive care

Supportive care

Most blood transfusions come from blood
banks and are collected from strangers who
donate blood. Sometimes, family members ask
if they can donate blood for a family member
with ALL. Typically, we do not want to transfuse
blood products collected from family members.
Your doctor can explain why is it safer to use
blood products from strangers than members
of your own family.

Antibiotics and treatment
For infection, antibiotics (for bacterial
infection), antifungal medicine (for fungal
infection), and antiviral drugs (for viral
infection) are used. These medications can be
used to prevent infections called prophylaxis.

Dialysis
Leukemia cells and chemotherapy sometimes
cause damage to the kidneys. If the damage is
severe, you may need dialysis. Dialysis is the
process of filtering blood when the kidneys are
unable. There are different types of dialysis.
Hemodialysis and hemofiltration remove waste
and water by circulating blood outside the body
through an external filter.

Get to know your care
team and help them
get to know you.

Hyperleukocytosis and
leukapheresis
Hyperleukocytosis (leukostasis) is an
extremely high lymphoblast count. Sometimes
those with hyperleukocytosis need to have
a machine remove lymphoblasts from the
blood in a process called leukapheresis. In
leukapheresis, you may be connected to
a machine called an apheresis machine.
The machine separates white blood cells
(leukocytes) from other blood cells. Once the
excess leukocytes are removed, the blood is
returned to your body.

Transfusions
Blood transfusions are common during ALL
treatment. A transfusion is a slow injection
of blood products such as red blood cells or
platelets into a vein. Over time, the body may
begin to reject blood transfusions.

true:

complete response or complete
remission. Treatment will be



in phases. Each phase has a



different name depending on the
treatment plan your care team is
using. All treatment plans include



an induction phase, which aims
to put leukemia into remission.
After (post) induction, there will
be multiple phases to rid the body



of any remaining leukemia cells.

No lymphoblasts are found in blood.
Less than 5% of blasts are found in bone
marrow when looking at the sample under
a microscope. This means that there are
fewer than 5 blasts out of every 100 blood
cells.
No signs and symptoms of cancer
outside the bone marrow. This is called
extramedullary disease and includes
lymph nodes, spleen skin, gums, testicles,
and central nervous system (CNS).
Blood recovery.

In an incomplete blood count recovery or
incomplete response (CRi), the platelet count
or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) has not
yet returned to normal. ANC is an estimate of
the body’s ability to fight infections, especially
bacterial infections.

Maintenance phase helps prevent
relapse.

Types of response

Phases of treatment

There are different types of treatment
response. When there are no signs of cancer,
it is called a complete response (CR) or
complete remission. This does not always
mean that ALL has been cured. Remission
can be short-term (temporary) or long-lasting
(permanent).

In general, there are several phases of intense
chemotherapy followed by a longer phase of
maintenance chemotherapy. Treatment phases
may include induction, after induction or postinduction phases, and maintenance. However,
not all doctors use the same terms when
discussing treatment. The number of phases
and the type chemotherapy given depend
on the type of leukemia, as well as how you
respond to the first phases of treatment.

A diagnosis of ALL is based on the presence
of 20 percent (20%) or more lymphoblasts in
the bone marrow. This means that at least 1
out of every 5 marrow cells are lymphoblasts.
However, in some cases a diagnosis of ALL is
possible with less than 20% blasts. Treatment
aims to reduce the number of blasts.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023

Treatment phases » Induction

Induction
Induction is the first phase of treatment.
You will likely spend time in the hospital for
part of this treatment. Treatment is a multidrug combination of chemotherapies (called
multiagent chemotherapy) and steroids.

Create a medical binder
A medical binder or notebook is a great way
to organize all of your records in one place.

The goal of induction is a complete response
(CR) or remission. In CR, less than 5%
of blasts remain at the end of induction.
When induction does not lead to a complete
response, it could be a sign that this cancer
is very difficult to treat. In many subtypes,
how ALL responds to initial treatment affects
prognosis.

3 Make copies of blood tests, imaging

results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

3 Choose a binder that meets your

needs. Consider a zipper pocket to
include a pen, small calendar, and
insurance cards.

After induction, bone marrow aspirate and
biopsy are used to look for a complete
response and to measure the amount of
leukemia cells that might remain called
minimal residual disease.

3 Create folders for insurance forms,

test types (blood, imaging, pathology,
radiology, genetics), treatments, and
procedures. Organize items in the
folder by date.

Minimal residual disease
In minimal or measurable residual disease
(MRD) very sensitive lab tests, such as flow
cytometry, PCR, or NGS, find leukemia cells
in bone marrow that cannot be seen under a
microscope. Not all MRD can be found with
tests. Treatment aims to reduce the amount of
MRD.

3 Use online patient portals to view

your test results and other records.
Download or print the records to add to
your binder.

3 Add a section for questions and to take
notes.

What do I need to know?

Bring your medical binder to appointments.
You never know when you might need it!

Induction phase is the most stressful part
of treatment. There is uncertainty, fear, and
confusion. In addition, there will be a lot of
tests, appointments, and disruption to routine.
Lastly, you will hear a lot of unfamiliar words to
describe a complex disease. Seek out support
groups at your local hospital, through social
media, or from those listed in the back of this
book. Look to friends, relatives, neighbors, and
coworkers for social support. Support services

such as counseling are also available. Ask the
treatment team for more information. They are
there to help.

45

Treatment phases » Post-induction » CNS disease

Post-induction

This helps to prevent relapse. Ask your
treatment team for help if you have trouble
paying for medicine or trouble remembering to
take your medicine.

After induction, there are multiple phases
of intensive chemotherapy. These postinduction phases are needed to rid the body
of any leukemia cells that might remain called
minimal residual disease (MRD) and aim to
prevent cancer from returning. You might hear
a post-induction phase called consolidation.
The time spent in post-induction phases and
the intensity of the drug regimen will vary. It will
be based on factors such as age, how well ALL
responds to treatment, and risk factors.

CNS disease
Treatment to prevent ALL from spreading to
the central nervous system (CNS) is called
CNS prophylaxis or prophylactic treatment.
CNS prophylaxis is typically given throughout
all phases of treatment.
All treatment plans include intrathecal (IT)
chemotherapy. IT chemotherapy is injected
into spinal fluid. Some treatments include
intrathecal treatment throughout therapy,
whereas others do not include it in later
phase maintenance therapy. Options for IT
chemotherapy include intrathecal methotrexate
or a combination of IT methotrexate,
cytarabine, and hydrocortisone (known as triple
IT chemotherapy). If ALL is found in your CNS
at the time of diagnosis, you may need more IT
chemotherapy or radiation to the brain.

Maintenance
Maintenance chemotherapy is the final, and
longest, stage of treatment ALL. Treatment
is less intensive than prior chemotherapy. It
usually lasts at least 2 years and is outpatient.
The goal is to lower the risk of relapse.

What do I need to know?
It is very important to continue taking medicine
as prescribed and not miss or skip any doses.

Standard of care is the bestknown way to treat particular
disease based on past clinical

Disease progression

Monitoring or surveillance watches for any
changes in your condition. See Guide 3.

When the percentage of ALL increases in
blood or bone marrow during treatment,
it is called progressive disease. Disease
progression also occurs when the number
of blasts within the blood or bone marrow
increase by at least 25%.

Relapse

Key points

When leukemia returns after a period of
remission, it is called a relapse. The goal of
treatment is to achieve remission again. This is
not always possible. A relapse is very serious.
It is important to ask about prognosis.





Those with relapsed ALL are placed into risk
groups. Length of first complete remission
(CR1) and site of relapse are two important
factors. Relapse can occur in the bone marrow
called isolated medullary relapse, in areas
outside of the marrow or blood such the brain
or testicles called isolated extramedullary
relapse, or a combination of both. In general,
those with a later relapse, 3 or more years
after starting treatment, have the best
prognosis







Refractory disease


When leukemia remains and does not respond
to treatment, it is called refractory or resistant
cancer. The cancer may be resistant at the
start of treatment or it may become resistant
during treatment. Refractory disease is very
serious. It is important to ask about prognosis.

The goal of treatment is a complete
response.
Induction is the first phase of treatment.
You will likely spend time in the hospital
for part of this treatment.
Post-induction therapy is the second
phase of treatment. It is needed to kill
any cancer cells called minimal residual
disease (MRD) that might be left after
induction.
Maintenance therapy is the final phase of
treatment. The goal is to lower the risk of
relapse.
Central nervous system (CNS)
prophylaxis is given to everyone to
prevent ALL from spreading to the brain
and spinal fluid.
Monitoring watches for any changes in
your condition.
ALL that returns after remission is called
relapse. To prevent relapse, it is important
to take medicine as prescribed and not
miss or skip any doses.
When ALL does not respond to treatment
or stops responding to treatment, it is
called refractory or resistant cancer.

Treatment is usually an intensive
combination of systemic
therapies.

Overview
Ph+ B-ALL is less common than other types
of B-ALL. Treatment aims to stop the activity
of the BCR::ABL fusion protein. Treatment is
usually an intensive combination of systemic
therapies that include tyrosin kinase inhibitors
(TKIs). Systemic therapies work throughout
the body. Treatment can be done as part of
a clinical trial when available, or as part of a
standard of care regimen.

There are 3 induction options:
Clinical trial



TKI with chemotherapy



TKI with steroid

There are a many TKIs and chemotherapies
used to treat ALL. Talk with your care team
about which treatment might be best for you.
Treatment response will be measured after
completing induction. The goal is a complete
response (CR). In less than a CR, cancer
remains. Treatment for less than a CR can
be found in the relapsed or refractory disease
section.

Induction
Many induction treatment regimens are
part of ongoing clinical trials. Induction is
a combination of systemic therapies. All
treatment regimens include systemic and/
or intrathecal (IT) therapy to prevent central
nervous system (CNS) disease. Typically, TKIs
are added in the middle of induction for those
who are found to be Ph+, whether they are
being treated as part of a clinical trial or with a
standard of care regimen.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 2023



After a CR, tests will look for minimal residual
disease (MRD). When MRD is found, it is
called MRD-positive (MRD+).

Ph-positive B-ALL » Consolidation » Relapsed or refractory disease

Consolidation

Surveillance and monitoring

After a complete response (remission),
consolidation is based on if any minimal
residual disease (MRD) remains.

During maintenance or after a hematopoietic
cell transplant, you will be monitored for signs
of recurrence called relapse.

MRD+

Relapsed or refractory
disease

Persistent or rising MRD is treated with one of
the following:


Blinatumomab with or without TKI



Multiagent chemotherapy with TKI



TKI

Relapse is the return of cancer after a
period of remission. The goal of treatment
is to achieve remission again. Cancer can
return in the bone marrow called isolated
medullary relapse, outside the bone marrow
called isolated extramedullary relapse, or
a combination of both (combined relapse).
Extramedullary relapse can occur in the
central nervous system or testicles. Location of
relapse will impact treatment.

After consolidation, a hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT) might be an option. The
timing of an HCT depends upon donor
availability and your health at the time of
potential HCT. An HCT is not an option for
everyone. You might be given a TKI after an
HCT.

Relapse can happen more than once. With
each relapse the goal of treatment is a
complete response or remission. When cancer
returns only in the bone marrow, it is called
isolated medullary relapse. When cancer
is found in the central nervous system and
testicles, but not in the bone marrow or blood,
it is called isolated extramedullary relapse.
In this case, systemic therapy is needed to
prevent relapse in bone marrow.

MRDIf MRD is negative (MRD-), options are:


Multiagent chemotherapy with TKI



TKI



Blinatumomab with TKI



HCT in some cases

When leukemia remains and does not respond
to treatment, it is called refractory.

Maintenance

Before starting treatment for relapsed or
refractory disease, you will have ABL1 kinase
domain mutation testing.

Maintenance is the last phase of treatment
given after a complete response and when
no minimal residual disease is found. This is
usually the longest phase of therapy and is
less intense than previous phases. TKIs are
given throughout maintenance until therapy
is complete. It is very important to continue to
take your medicine as prescribed and not miss
any doses.

combination of systemic therapies. Systemic
therapies work throughout the body. All
treatment regimens include systemic therapy
and/or intrathecal therapy (injected into the
spinal fluid) to prevent CNS disease.

Adults who are 65 years of age and over or
those who have serious health conditions may
opt for a palliative steroid instead of a clinical
trial or systemic therapy. For AYAs, a pediatricbased treatment regimen is preferred.

HCT
The timing of an HCT depends upon donor
availability, length of remission, your social
support, and your health at the time of
potential HCT.

Treatment response will be measured after
completing induction. The goal is a complete
response (CR). After a complete response, you
will be monitored for minimal residual disease
(MRD). When MRD is found, it is called
MRD-positive (MRD+). In less than a CR,
cancer remains. Treatment for less than a CR
will follow relapsed or refractory section.

Maintenance
Maintenance therapy is given after
consolidation with multiagent chemotherapy
or blinatumomab. Maintenance is given to
prevent the return or spread of ALL. It is
usually a continuation of treatment, but might
be at a lower dose.

Consolidation

Surveillance

Consolidation options are based on if tests
find minimal or measurable residual disease
(MRD).

During maintenance or after an HCT, you will
be monitored for signs of recurrence.

In general, MRD positivity at the end of
induction predicts a high chance of relapse.

conversation with your care team.

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!
