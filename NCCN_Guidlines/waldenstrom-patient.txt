WM basics

What is WM?

Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM)
is a slow-growing cancer that does
not always require treatment. It is a
type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

WM is the most common form of
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). LPL
starts in the bone marrow and can cause a
shortage of essential blood cells needed by
the body. In WM, a naturally occurring but
dysfunctional protein called an antibody is
also released into the blood. Large amounts
of this antibody can cause blood to become
abnormally thick.

What is WM?

How WM starts

Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a nonHodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
is not a single disease. It refers to a group
of many different cancers that start in white
blood cells called lymphocytes. Some types
are fast-growing (aggressive), while others are
slow-growing (indolent). In general, WM grows
slowly and does not always require treatment.

Most bones have a soft, spongy filling called
bone marrow. Bone marrow is where blood
cells are “born” as blood stem cells. Blood
stem cells develop into one of three types of
“mature” blood cells, which have different jobs
in the body.

Blood cells
Bone marrow is where the
essential blood cells needed
by your body are “born” as
blood stem cells. Blood stem
cells develop into red blood
cells, white blood cells, or
platelets.

What is WM?
a different type of white blood cell called a
plasmacyte, or plasma cell. These “hybrid”
lymphocyte–plasmacyte cells multiply over
and over. The cells eventually take over the
bone marrow, preventing it from making the
blood cells needed by the body. The shortage
of blood cells starts to cause health issues that
you can notice (symptoms).

The lymphatic system is a network of tissues
and organs that help your body fight infection
and disease. It is a major part of the body’s
immune system. The tissues and organs that
make up the lymphatic system are made
mostly of white blood cells called lymphocytes.
The two main types of lymphocytes are B
lymphocytes (B cells) and T lymphocytes
(T cells).

Antigens and antibodies

An antigen is any substance that makes your
immune system jump into action to protect
itself. In other words, antigens are things your
body perceives as non-self or threats. Antigens
can come from outside the body, such as
toxins, viruses, chemicals, and bacteria.
Antigens can also be found inside the body,
such as on the surface of cancer cells or other
cells.

In lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, B cells
can change and start to take on features of

Structure of blood
Red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets are
carried throughout the body
in a clear, yellow liquid called
plasma. Plasma makes up a
little over half of blood. The
antibody that causes blood to
thicken in some people with
WM is found in plasma.

the nose and gums) and vision problems
(blurred or double vision). Other effects
of hyperviscosity include nervous system
symptoms (headaches, dizziness, seizures)
and cardiovascular symptoms (shortness of
breath, chest pain).

Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are
proteins that work in different ways to help
your body protect itself against antigens. There
are 5 main types of immunoglobulins (“Ig” for
short): IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM.
Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is the first antibody
your body makes to fight a new infection. Most
adults have a very low level of IgM in the blood
at any given time. In most people with LPL, the
cancer cells make and release large amounts
of IgM into the blood. This is Waldenström
macroglobulinemia (WM).

Asymptomatic WM

Long before causing any symptoms, WM
starts as IgM monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (IgM MGUS). In IgM
MGUS, the level of IgM in the blood is higher
than normal, but low compared to WM. There
is also a low percentage of lymphoplasmacytic
cells in bone marrow. If these levels increase
but not enough to cause symptoms, it is
referred to as “smoldering” or asymptomatic
WM. No treatment is needed for IgM MGUS or
smoldering WM.

In some people with WM, there is so much
IgM in the blood that it becomes abnormally
thick. This is called hyperviscosity. Blood
cannot flow through the body properly if it is
too thick. Hyperviscosity can cause symptoms
including abnormal bleeding (especially from

Types of antibodies
IgM is the largest of all the
antibodies. Its bulky size and
structure contribute to the
abnormal thickness of the blood
(hyperviscosity) that can be
found in some people with WM.

Testing for WM

Bone marrow tests

If your doctors suspect WM, one of the
first things they will do is test your bone
marrow.

marrow is removed from the breastbone. You
may receive a light sedative before the test.
Your doctor will clean your skin and then use
local anesthesia to numb the site. Once numb,
a hollow needle will be inserted into your skin
and then pushed into the bone to remove the
liquid bone marrow with a syringe. Then, a
slightly wider needle will be inserted into the
bone and rotated to remove a small piece of
bone and soft marrow. These biopsies may
cause bruising and tenderness or pain at the
biopsy site. In rare cases, the biopsy may
cause a hematoma. A hematoma is a
collection of blood under the skin, trapped
outside of a blood vessel. It is not the same as
a bruise.

Bone marrow tests
A small amount of bone marrow needs to be
removed from your body in order to be tested.
This is done in two ways:


Bone marrow aspiration removes a small
amount of liquid bone marrow.



Bone marrow biopsy removes a small
amount of solid bone and bone marrow.

The bone marrow samples are sent to
a laboratory and tested by an expert in
diagnosing diseases of the blood and bone

These procedures are usually done at the
same time on the back of the hip bone. Rarely,

Bone marrow
aspiration and biopsy
In order to diagnose (or rule
out) WM, a sample of your
bone marrow must be tested.
If cells that have features
of both B cells and plasma
cells can be seen under a
microscrope, it is likely that
you have WM. You will have
other tests to confirm the
diagnosis.

marrow, called a hematopathologist. Testing
looks for the following things:


Lymphoplasmacytic cells in your bone
marrow



Proteins usually seen on the surface of
lymphoplasmacytic cells



Gene mutations usually found in people
with WM

Genes are pieces of DNA that contain
information passed from parent to child.
Humans have over 20,000 genes. Every
person has two copies of each gene, one from
each parent. Genes contain instructions that
determine things like your eye color, hair color,
and height.
Genes can undergo changes called variants
or mutations. Some mutations are harmful and
can increase the risk of developing certain
cancers, for example. Other mutations may
have health benefits or may not impact your
health at all.

These tests are explained in greater detail
below.

Pathology review

After a biopsy, the removed tissue is sliced
into very thin layers that are placed on a glass
slide and examined under a microscope. In
people with LPL or WM, there are abnormal
cells that have features of both lymphocytes
and plasma cells. These cells are called
lymphoplasmacytic cells.

Mutations can occur spontaneously or as a
result of exposure to harmful things in the
environment. Mutations can also be passed
down from parent to child (inherited). There
are two gene mutations that may be found
in people with WM and that may affect
treatment planning.

Protein tests

Most people with WM have an abnormal
(mutated) version of a gene called MYD88.
Everyone with suspected WM should be
tested for this mutation. While uncommon, it
is possible to have WM even if you don’t have
the MYD88 mutation.

The removed bone marrow is also examined
under a microscope to look for proteins
usually found on the surface of WM cells.
Proteins called sIgM, CD19, CD20, and CD22
can usually be seen in people with WM, but
proteins called CD5, CD10, and CD23 are
much less commonly seen. The names of the
laboratory tests used to look for these
proteins are:

Testing for WM

Blood tests

Blood tests

Beta-2 microglobulin

Beta-2 microglobulin is a protein that can
be measured in blood. The level may be
high in people with cancer of the blood
or bone marrow. This test may provide
information about how severe the cancer is
and how it will respond to treatment. More
research is needed, however, on using beta2 microglobulin levels to make treatment
decisions.

In addition to bone marrow tests, blood tests
play an important role in diagnosing and
planning treatment for WM.

Testing for antibodies

People with WM have a high level of an
antibody called immunoglobulin M (IgM) in
their blood. If WM is suspected, your doctor
will order blood tests to determine the types
and amounts of antibodies in your blood. The
names of these blood tests are:


Serum quantitative immunoglobulins



Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)



Serum immunofixation electrophoresis
(SIFE)



Complete blood count

One of the most common blood tests is
called a complete blood count (CBC). A CBC
measures the number of white blood cells, red
blood cells, and platelets in the blood. Blood
counts are often low in people with WM.

Blood smear

Serum free light chain (SFLC)

A blood smear is a test that provides
information on both the number and shape of
blood cells in a sample. It is recommended as
part of the initial testing for WM.

Blood viscosity test

High levels of IgM in the blood can cause it to
thicken. This is called hyperviscosity. A blood
(also called serum) viscosity test measures
the thickness of blood. Blood thickness is
measured in centipoise (cP).

Blood-clotting test

If you have unexplained bruising or bleeding,
you may be tested for a blood clotting disorder
called von Willebrand disease. This disease
is rare and most people who have it are born
with it. However, it can develop later in life in
people with WM and similar diseases, usually
in people with a high blood IgM level. If this
happens, it is called acquired von Willebrand
disease.

A blood viscosity level of 1.8 cP is
considered higher than normal. Symptoms of
hyperviscosity often start when the viscosity
level goes above 4.0 cP, but some people may
have symptoms at a lower level.
Your doctor may order a viscosity test if
you have symptoms of hyperviscosity, such
as abnormal bleeding, vision problems, or
nervous system problems.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Waldenström Macroglobulinemia, 2022

Cold-sensitive antibodies

Some people with WM have abnormal
antibodies in their blood that react to cold
temperatures. These cold-sensitive antibodies

14

2

Testing for WM

Blood tests

can affect the level of IgM in blood. They may
or may not cause symptoms.
Cryoglobulins are one type of cold-sensitive
antibody that can be found in people with
WM. They can interfere with blood IgM level
measurements by causing the level of IgM to
be lower than it is.

Non-Waldenström
lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma
Because Waldenström is the most
common form of lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma, the names are often used
interchangeably. While there are types of
LPL that do not release IgM, these “nonWaldenström” types make up less than
5 percent of all LPLs. Treatment of these
rare types of LPL is similar to that of WM,
but people with a non-Waldenström LPL
are less likely to have hyperviscosity.

When the body drops below its normal
temperature, cryoglobulins form solid or gellike clumps that block blood flow to your body.
This is called cryoglobulinemia. Over time,
this can damage blood vessels and tissues.
A test called a cryocrit will be ordered if
cryoglobulinemia is suspected.
Cold agglutinins are a less common type of
cold-sensitive antibody. Less than 10 percent
of people with WM have cold agglutinins in
their blood. Antibodies that mistakenly target
or harm the body’s own tissues or organs are
called autoantibodies. Cold agglutinins are
autoantibodies that harm red blood cells.

therapies is planned, expect to be tested for
the hepatitis B virus.

At low temperatures, cold agglutinins cause
red blood cells to clump together (agglutinate),
which causes the red blood cells to be
destroyed by the body. A very high level of cold
agglutinins in the blood can cause a serious
health condition called chronic hemolytic
anemia, in which red blood cells are destroyed
faster than they are made.

If you are a carrier, you will be closely
monitored for signs and symptoms of active
hepatitis B infection during treatment and for
several months afterward. Your doctor may
prescribe antiviral medication to prevent reactivation of the hepatitis B virus.

Hepatitis B

Hepatitis C

Some targeted therapies used to treat WM
can activate the hepatitis B virus in people
who are carriers. Being a carrier means you
have the hepatitis B virus in your blood, but
you do not have any signs or symptoms of
the disease. If treatment with certain targeted

People with WM—especially those with
cryoglobulinemia—may have underlying

have cryoglobulinemia, your blood will likely be
tested for the hepatitis C virus.

Other blood tests

Your doctor will order other blood tests that
provide information about how well your liver,
kidneys, and other organs are working. The
levels of the following will be tested:


Urine tests

IgM can collect in both blood and urine. Your
doctor may order one or more of the following
tests to gain additional information:

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to
creatinine ratio



Electrolytes



A protein made by the liver called
albumin

Health history and physical exam

Expect your doctor to review your health
history in detail. Your doctor will want to know
a lot about your past and current health. You
will likely be asked about:

Imaging
A widely used imaging test called computed
tomography (CT) can provide additional
information about the extent of WM. CT takes
many pictures of an area of the body from
different angles using x-rays. A computer
combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures.
CT scans of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis
are recommended to help your treatment team
determine if your lymph nodes, spleen, or
other organs are enlarged. CT can also show if
cancer has spread beyond the bone marrow.



Illnesses, diseases, and surgeries



Medicines that you take (prescription or
over-the-counter)



Your lifestyle (your diet, how active you
are, and whether you smoke or drink
alcohol)



Symptoms that may be related to WM or
complications of WM

Your doctor will also perform a thorough
physical exam of your body to look for signs of
WM and for general signs of disease.

Retinal exam

A substance called contrast is used to make
the pictures clearer. The contrast is injected
into your vein. You will be asked a series of
questions to make sure you are not allergic
to the dye. Allergic reactions include throat
swelling and hives.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Waldenström Macroglobulinemia, 2022



Hyperviscosity can cause eyesight problems
such as blurred or double vision. If the level
of IgM in your blood is 3.0 g/dL or higher, or if
your doctor suspects hyperviscosity, you may
have an exam of the back of your eye to check
for any changes or bleeding.

It is important to tell your
treatment team about
any new or worsening
symptoms you have that
may be related to WM.

Retinal exam
Hyperviscosity can cause
small blood vessels inside
the eyes to become engorged
and have a “sausage link”
appearance. A retinal exam
can identify this and other
changes to the eyes caused
by thick blood.

Computed tomography
(CT)
CT scans can show if your
lymph nodes or organs are
enlarged. They are also
helpful for determining if
cancer has spread beyond the

Other testing

Peripheral neuropathy



Testing for a build-up of an abnormal
protein called amyloid in your organs or
tissues (amyloidosis). This may include a
special stain on the bone marrow sample
called Congo red and removal and testing
of fat cells (a fat pad biopsy).



Testing for antibodies against an
important protein needed to maintain
a healthy nervous system called
myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG).
Symptoms of anti-MAG peripheral
neuropathy include loss of feeling
in fingers and toes, inability to feel
vibrations, difficulty walking properly, and
shaky hands and legs.



Testing for antibodies against ganglioside
M1, a complex molecule in the nervous
system.

Your brain and spinal cord make up your
central nervous system. The human body
also has a peripheral nervous system, which
includes all the other nerves found throughout
the body (peripheral nerves).
Damage to peripheral nerves can cause pain,
numbness, tingling, or weakness. This is called
peripheral neuropathy. Damage often occurs in
the hands and feet but can affect other parts of
the body. Peripheral neuropathy is common in
people with WM and may be the only source of
symptoms.
You may be referred to a neurologist if you
have peripheral neuropathy. A neurologist is
an expert in nervous system disorders. The
neurologist may order testing that includes:


Nerve conduction studies (NCS)



Electromyography (EMG)

Electromyography
An electromyelogram can
detect nerve damage in people
with symptoms of peripheral
neuropathy such as pain,

Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
cancer type and stage, treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for
the participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss it with family,
friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that
you can leave and seek treatment outside of
the clinical trial at any time.

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider
all of the treatment options available for their
cancer type, including standard treatments and
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.


Phase I trials study the safety and side
effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.



Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.



Start the conversation

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. Try not to
be discouraged if you cannot join. New clinical
trials are always becoming available.

Frequently asked questions

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood
by many with cancer.

Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo

Testing for WM

Clinical trials

with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or child care due
to extra appointments. During the trial, you
will continue to receive standard cancer care.
This care is billed to—and often covered by—
insurance. You are responsible for copays and
any costs for this care that are not covered by
your insurance.

Plasmapheresis

Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM)
is not curable with current treatments.
In people without symptoms, there is no
benefit to treatment. WM that is causing
symptoms is treated with targeted
therapy, chemotherapy, or both. First,
you may need to have immunoglobulin
M (IgM) removed from your blood using
a procedure called plasmapheresis.

Rituximab can cause IgM to increase by
25 percent or more (known as IgM “flare”).
This sharp increase in IgM can lead to
hyperviscosity, which causes serious side
effects. Lowering the level of IgM before
treatment with rituximab is important in order to
reduce the risk of dangers from hyperviscosity.

What to expect

First, an intravenous line (an “IV”) is put into
your vein to remove the plasma. Next, a salt
solution and the donated plasma are put back
into your blood. Plasmapheresis can take 2 to
3 hours. During this process, you are seated in
a reclining chair or asked to lie down on a bed.

In those with symptoms, the goals of treatment
are to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk
of damage to your organs. Some people will
need plasmapheresis before treatment.

The IV is typically put into a vein in your arm.
For some people, a catheter may need to be
inserted. A catheter is a thin, long tube that is
often placed in the chest. This thin tube goes
into a large vein and can stay in after the
treatment and be used again, if needed.

Plasmapheresis
Plasmapheresis, also called plasma exchange,
is a procedure that removes plasma from
the blood. Plasma is the watery, light yellow
part of blood that contains IgM and other
proteins. Plasmapheresis itself is not a cancer
treatment. Rather, it is a way of relieving
symptoms and helping your body prepare for
systemic therapy.

After plasmapheresis

The level of IgM in your blood will be
monitored closely after plasmapheresis.
If symptoms of hyperviscosity return, you
can have plasmapheresis again. It is not
uncommon to need it more than once.

Who needs plasmapheresis before
treatment?

If your IgM level goes above 4,000 mg/dL
during treatment with rituximab, you might
have plasmapheresis again, even if you do not
have symptoms.

People with symptoms of hyperviscosity
should have plasmapheresis right away. After
plasmapheresis, systemic therapy should be
started as soon as possible.

You may need a red blood cell transfusion after
plasmapheresis. During a transfusion, blood
is given to you through an IV. The purpose of
a red blood cell transfusion is to replace blood
loss that leads to a low red blood cell count
(anemia).

People without symptoms of hyperviscosity
but with a very high level of IgM (4,000 mg/
dL or higher) might also have plasmapheresis
first if treatment with a targeted therapy called
rituximab (Rituxan®) is planned.

Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

At this time, there are 5 systemic therapy
regimens preferred for primary (initial)
treatment. See Guide 2. While the regimens
in Guide 2 are preferred, other recommended
options for systemic therapy are listed in
Guide 3.

Systemic therapy is the most effective and
widely used treatment for WM. Medicines
taken by mouth or put directly into the
bloodstream to treat cancer are systemic
therapies. The two main types of systemic
therapy used to treat WM are targeted therapy
and conventional (“cytotoxic”) chemotherapy.

More information on the following is provided
below:

Chemotherapy stops the growth of cancer
cells, either by killing the cells or stopping
them from routinely dividing. Targeted
therapy, on the other hand, usually targets
specific features on the inside or outside of
cancer cells to take advantage of potential
weaknesses.

Systemic therapy

Rituximab (Rituxan®) and Rituxan
Hycela®

BTK inhibitors

BTK inhibitors are one kind of targeted therapy
used to treat WM. They are a type of tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI). BTK inhibitors currently
used for the treatment of WM include:

Rituximab (Rituxan®) is a targeted therapy
widely used to treat WM. It is a type of
antibody therapy. For the initial treatment of
WM, rituximab is often given in combination
with other systemic therapies. If you cannot
have rituximab, a similar drug called
ofatumumab (Arzerra®) may be given instead.

How it works
Rituximab is an anti-CD20 therapy. Blood cells
with cancer (and some healthy blood cells)
have a protein on their surface called CD20.
Rituxan® targets and attaches to the CD20
protein. This helps your immune system find
and attack the cancer cells.

Ibrutinib (Imbruvica®)



Zanubrutinib (Brukinsa®)



Acalabrutinib (Calquence®)

How they work
WM starts in lymphocytes called B cells. B
cells contain a protein called Bruton’s tyrosine
kinase (BTK). The BTK protein sends signals
that help B cells stay alive and multiply. By
blocking these signals, BTK inhibitors help
stop cancerous B cells from surviving and
multiplying.

How it’s given
The first time you receive rituximab, it will
be given by infusion. This means it will be
slowly injected into a vein. Your doctor may
give you medication beforehand to prevent an
allergic reaction. After receiving at least one
full infusion, future doses of rituximab can be
given as an injection (shot) in the abdomen.
This subcutaneous (under the skin) form of
rituximab is called Rituxan Hycela®. Patients
often prefer this method.

Good to know
Up to 4 out of 10 people with WM have a
mutation of the CXCR4 gene. People with
a CXCR4 mutation may have a shorter and
slower response to treatment with a BTK
inhibitor. If your doctor is considering treatment
with a BTK inhibitor, your bone marrow or
blood may be tested for CXCR4 mutations.
How they are given
BTK inhibitors are taken by mouth as a
pill. Unlike chemotherapy, which is given in
cycles, BTK inhibitors are taken continuously
to control WM. Stopping treatment abruptly
can cause WM to return and to get worse
(progress) quickly. Before you start treatment
with a BTK inhibitor, tell your doctor if you are
taking any blood thinners.

IgM flare
Rituximab can cause the level of IgM in your
blood to increase by 25 percent or more. This
is called IgM flare. The increase in IgM can
cause blood to thicken (hyperviscosity). If
blood thickens enough, serious symptoms may
develop (symptomatic hyperviscosity). If the
level of IgM is high before starting treatment
with rituximab, your doctor may recommend
having plasmapheresis first. The goal is to help
prevent symptomatic hyperviscosity before it
starts.

Ninlaro® is planned.

pressure, bleeding problems, infections, heart
rhythm problems, and tumor lysis syndrome
(TLS). TLS is a disorder caused by the
breakdown products of cancer cells. It can
lead to kidney failure and other serious health
problems.

Other side effects
Bortezomib (Velcade®) can cause a nerve
problem called peripheral neuropathy.
Symptoms of this nerve problem include
pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle
weakness. It usually affects the hands and
feet before other areas of the body. In people
who already have neuropathy, bortezomib can
make it worse. Your doctor will take this into
consideration when recommending a systemic
therapy regimen.

Proteasome inhibitors

Proteasome inhibitors are another type of
targeted therapy used to treat WM. At this
time, there are 3 proteasome inhibitors used
for initial treatment of WM:


Bortezomib (Velcade®)



Carfilzomib (Kyprolis®)



Ixazomib (Ninlaro®)

Ixazomib (Ninlaro®) is the only proteasome
inhibitor that is taken orally (by mouth) as
a capsule. To treat WM, ixazomib is used
in combination with dexamethasone and
rituximab (Rituxan®).

Carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) may cause serious
damage to the heart and lungs, especially in
elderly patients.

Chemotherapy

How they work
All cells contain tiny barrel-shaped machinery
called proteasomes. Proteasomes maintain the
right balance of proteins in cells by breaking
down and destroying unneeded proteins.
Proteasome inhibitors prevent proteasomes
from getting rid of excess proteins. If proteins
in cancer cells continue to build up, the cell will
eventually explode and die.

Most chemotherapy medicines used to treat
WM are given intravenously. This means they
are slowly put into your bloodstream through
a vein. Some are taken by mouth as a pill or
injected under the skin, called a subcutaneous
injection.
Chemotherapy is often given in cycles of
treatment days followed by days of rest. This
allows your body to recover before the next
cycle. Cycles usually last for several weeks.

Shingles
Proteasome inhibitors can reactivate the
herpes zoster (“shingles”) virus. Shingles
is a painful skin rash. It is caused by the
same virus that causes chickenpox (varicella
zoster). Shingles often forms as a stripe or
band of blisters on one side of the body or
face. The rash may be more widespread (like

Waldenström Macroglobulinemia, 2022

Alkylating agents
Bendamustine and cyclophosphamide are
chemotherapy medicines used to treat WM
and other cancers. They belong to a group
of drugs called alkylating agents. Alkylating

28

3

Treatment guide

Systemic therapy
Side effects of systemic therapy

agents damage cell DNA to prevent cells from
copying themselves.

Systemic therapy can kill healthy cells
in addition to cancer cells. The damage
to healthy cells causes potentially harsh
side effects. The side effects are different
for everyone and depend on the specific
medicine(s) given, the dose, and the length of
treatment.

In damaging DNA, alkylating agents can also
damage bone marrow cells. Bone marrow is
where new blood cells are made. This stem
cell damage can lead to other blood cancers
(leukemias) years after treatment.

Nucleoside analogs
Cladribine and fludarabine belong to a group
of chemotherapy medicines called nucleoside
analogs. Nucleoside analogs are toxic to bone
marrow stem cells.

Most side effects appear when treatment
starts and stop when it is over. However, some
side effects may appear years after finishing
treatment. Ask your treatment team for a full
list of common and rare side effects of each
systemic therapy you are receiving.

A stem cell transplant may be considered for
treating WM that returns more than once after
treatment. If there is even a small chance
that you may have a stem cell transplant in
the future, your doctor will avoid or limit the
use of cladribine and fludarabine. Stem cell
transplantation is discussed in more detail on
page 37.

Common side effects of systemic therapy
include:


Extreme tiredness (fatigue)



Nausea and vomiting



Diarrhea

Stem cell damage could lead to other types of
serious blood disorders unrelated to WM, such
as leukemia.

Secondary cancers

BCL-2 is a protein found in high amounts
in WM cells. This protein helps prevent cell
death. Venetoclax (Venclexta®) is an oral
targeted therapy that attaches to and inhibits
(blocks) BCL-2, allowing the cancer cells to
self-destruct. Venetoclax may be used to treat
WM that returns after initial treatment.

Other care before and during systemic
therapy

After systemic therapy, you will have testing
to check treatment results. Testing will likely
include a physical exam, blood tests, and
computed tomography (CT) scans of your
chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

IgA and IgG monitoring
Treatment with many of the recommended
systemic therapy regimens can cause
the levels of two antibodies (IgA and IgG)
to become too low. You will have blood
tests during treatment to make sure these
antibodies are not depleted.

Response to treatment is based on the level
of IgM in your blood after systemic therapy.
While the IgM level is important, it is not the
only factor used to determine if treatment was
successful. Some systemic therapy medicines
can cause IgM levels to fluctuate, making it
difficult to know if the cancer is responding to
treatment.

Pneumocystis pneumonia prevention
Pneumocystis pneumonia is a fungal infection
of the lungs. It is most often found in people
with a weak immune system. Your doctor
may prescribe a medication to lower the risk
of pneumocystis pneumonia before starting
treatment with certain systemic therapy
regimens.

For example, rituximab (Rituxan®) can cause
IgM levels to go up for weeks or months
(IgM flare). Bortezomib (Velcade®) can cause
IgM levels to go down without killing cancer
cells, giving a false impression of response to
treatment. Other medicines can simply take
longer than others to lower IgM levels.

Clinical trial

Joining a clinical trial is also an option for
treating WM. Participating in a clinical trial
allows you to get treatment while also helping
cancer researchers learn more about this rare
disease. See page 20 for more information on
clinical trials.

In addition to considering the IgM level, your
doctor will consider whether you have any new
or worsening symptoms.
Specific criteria are used to determine how
well WM responds to treatment. These
response categories are also used to
guide decision-making about whether more
treatment is needed. See Guide 4.

Complete or almost complete
response

A complete response to treatment means
that the IgM level has returned to normal,
and no cancer can be detected in your bone
marrow using current testing technology.

When treatment is over
Stable or progressive disease

A very good partial response to treatment
means that the IgM level went down by 90
percent or more. Any enlarged lymph nodes or
organs have returned to normal size and you
have no symptoms.

If there is no response to treatment, it
means the IgM level stayed about the same.
This is called stable disease. Progressive
disease refers to an increase in IgM level
and worsening of WM symptoms. Switching
to a different systemic therapy regimen is
recommended for either of these response
types.

No further treatment is needed. Your IgM level
will be monitored. The IgM level should be
measured every 3 months for 2 years, then
every 4 to 6 months for an additional 3 years,
then every 6 to 12 months thereafter. If the
IgM level increases beyond the normal range,
it doesn’t mean you automatically need more
treatment. More treatment is only needed if
symptoms return.

Bone marrow biopsy

Sometimes there can be a disconnect between
how well treatment is working and the level
of IgM in your blood. If you seem to be
responding to treatment and your symptoms
are getting better but the IgM level is still high,
your doctor may order a bone marrow biopsy
to get more information.

Partial or minor response

If the cancer responds to treatment but not
completely, whether you need more treatment
depends on whether you have symptoms. If
you have symptoms, switching to a different
systemic therapy regimen is recommended.

While uncommon, it is possible for a slowgrowing lymphoma like WM to transform into
a fast-growing lymphoma. One reason your
doctor may want to do a bone marrow biopsy
is to rule out transformation to a fast-growing
lymphoma.

If you do not have symptoms, no further
treatment is needed. Your IgM level will be
monitored. The IgM level should be measured
every 3 months for 2 years, then every 4 to 6
months for 3 more years, then every 6 to 12
months thereafter. If the IgM level increases
beyond the normal range, it doesn’t mean
you automatically need more treatment. More
treatment is only needed if symptoms return.

A change in your symptoms may be a sign
of transformation. Symptoms may include
unexplained fever, night sweats, or significant
weight loss. These are called “B symptoms.”
Other symptoms can include enlarged lymph
nodes and organs.
If testing finds that WM has transformed, there
are NCCN Guidelines for Patients® available
addressing other types of lymphomas.

If you had a partial or minor response to
systemic therapy that contained rituximab
(Rituxan®), continuing treatment with rituximab
alone as maintenance therapy may be an
option. Maintenance therapy may keep you
cancer-free for longer.

Survivorship

Survivorship

Healthy habits
Monitoring for the return of cancer is important
after finishing treatment. But, it is also
important to keep up with other aspects of your
health. Steps you can take to help prevent
other health issues and to improve your quality
of life are described next.

Survivorship focuses on the physical,
emotional, and financial issues unique to
cancer survivors. Managing the long-term side
effects of cancer and its treatment, staying
connected with your primary care doctor, and
living a healthy lifestyle are important parts
of survivorship.

Systemic therapies used to treat WM can have
serious late or long-term effects, including the
development of other (secondary) cancers.
Treatment with alkylating chemotherapy drugs
in particular can increase the risk of developing
other blood cancers. Bendamustine and
cyclophosphamide are alkylating agents that
may be used to treat WM.

Your primary care doctor
After finishing cancer treatment, your
primary care doctor, also known as a general
practitioner (GP) or primary care physician
(PCP), will play an important role in your care.
Your oncologist (cancer doctor) and PCP
should work together to make sure you get the
follow-up care you need. Ask your oncologist
for a written survivorship care plan that
includes:


A summary of your cancer treatment
history



A description of possible short-term, late,
and long-term side effects



Recommendations for monitoring for the
return of cancer



Information on when your care will be
transferred to your PCP



Clear roles and responsibilities for both
your cancer care team and your PCP



Recommendations on your overall health
and well-being

As a cancer survivor, it is especially important
to get screened for other types of cancer,
such as breast, prostate, colorectal, and skin
cancers. Your primary care doctor can tell you
which cancer screening tests you should have
based on your age and risk level.
Get other recommended health care for
your age, such as blood pressure screening,
hepatitis C screening, and immunizations
(such as the flu shot).
Leading a healthy lifestyle includes maintaining
a healthy body weight. Try to exercise at a
moderate intensity for at least 150 minutes per
week. All patients should have a discussion
with their doctor before starting a new exercise
regimen. Eat a healthy diet with lots of plantbased foods.
Alcohol may increase the risk of certain
cancers. Drink little to no alcohol. If you are a
smoker, quit! Counseling and other resources
are available. Your treatment team can help.

Stem cell transplant

Collecting stem cells
If stem cells are being collected from your
blood (most common method), a process
called apheresis is used. Your blood will be
removed from a large vein, most likely in your
arm. It will flow through a tube and into a
machine that removes stem cells. The rest of
your blood will be returned to you in your
other arm.

A stem cell transplant may be an option for
treating relapsed WM. Blood stem cells are
cells that develop into mature blood cells.
Stem cells and mature blood cells are made
in bone marrow. The goal of a stem cell
transplant is to replace unhealthy blood stem
cells with healthy ones. This is done by first
destroying bone marrow with high doses of
chemotherapy, and then transplanting healthy
blood stem cells. The healthy blood stem cells
form new marrow and blood cells.

Apheresis typically takes 4 to 6 hours and
does not require anesthesia. It may take
two or more sessions to obtain enough stem
cells. During the procedure, you may have
lightheadedness, chills, numbness around the
lips, and cramping in the hands.

The type of stem cell transplant recommended
is called high-dose therapy with autologous
stem cell rescue (HDT/ASCR). This type of
stem cell transplant uses your own healthy
stem cells, not stem cells from a donor. The
phases of an autologous stem cell transplant
are described below.

If the stem cells are being collected from your
bone marrow (rarely done for autologous stem
cell rescue), a procedure called bone marrow
aspiration is used. For this procedure, you will
be given either regional anesthesia or general
anesthesia. Next, a needle will be inserted
through your skin into your hip bone to draw
out the bone marrow. The needle must be
inserted many times into one or more spots to
collect enough marrow. The marrow will then
be processed to collect the stem cells.

At this time, an allogeneic stem cell
transplant—which uses stem cells from a
donor—should only be considered as part of a
clinical trial.

Mobilizing stem cells
Blood stem cells are usually taken
(“harvested”) from blood (as opposed to bone
marrow) in an autologous stem cell transplant.
However, there aren’t many stem cells
naturally found in blood. Medicine is used to
increase the number of stem cells your body
makes, which increases the number of stem
cells that enter your bloodstream. This process
is called mobilization.

After apheresis or aspiration, your harvested
cells will be combined with a preservative.
Then, they will be frozen and stored to keep
them alive until the transplant. This process is
called cryopreservation.

High-dose chemotherapy
After your stem cells have been harvested,
you will receive a high dose of chemotherapy.
A high dose of chemotherapy destroys normal
cells in the bone marrow. This increases
the risk of fatigue due to anemia, the risk of
bleeding due to decreased platelets, and the

The type of medicine used is called
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),
which is given by injection (shots) daily for 5
to 6 days.

risk of infection due to the killing of normal
white blood cells.
Not every person can tolerate high-dose
chemotherapy before the transplant. Your
physician will make recommendations about
this procedure in consideration of your age and
ongoing medical issues.

Transplanting stem cells
When chemotherapy is finished, your
harvested stem cells will be put back into your
body using a transfusion. A transfusion is a
slow injection of blood products through a
central line into a large vein. A central line (or
central venous catheter) is a thin tube. The
tube will be inserted into your skin through
one cut, then into your vein through a second
cut. Local anesthesia will be used. Placing a
central line is usually done by an interventional
radiologist.

The transplanted stem cells will travel to your
bone marrow and grow. New, healthy blood
cells will form. This is called engraftment.
It usually takes about 2 to 4 weeks. During
engraftment, you will have little or no immune
defense. You will need to stay in a very clean
environment and may be given an antibiotic
to prevent or treat infection. You may also be
given a blood transfusion to prevent bleeding
and to treat low red blood cell counts (anemia).
While waiting for the cells to engraft, you will
likely feel tired and weak.

Key points

Key points


WM is not curable with currently available
systemic therapies.





Targeted therapy, chemotherapy, or both
are used to treat WM that is causing
symptoms. They are types of systemic
therapy.

Joining a clinical trial allows you to get
treatment while helping researchers learn
more about this rare cancer.



WM may return after primary treatment.
This is called relapse. Relapsed WM is
usually treated with systemic therapy.



An autologous stem cell transplant may
be an option for treating WM that returns
more than once.



Managing the long-term effects of cancer
and its treatment, staying connected
with your primary care doctor, and living
a healthy lifestyle are important parts of
survivorship.



Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) is a
procedure that removes plasma from the
blood.



People with symptomatic hyperviscosity
should have plasmapheresis right away
to relieve symptoms and prevent organ
damage.



People without symptoms of
hyperviscosity but with a high IgM level
might also have plasmapheresis before
starting treatment that includes rituximab.



Some people will need a red blood cell
transfusion after plasmapheresis.

Making treatment decisions

It’s your
yourchoice
choice| Questions to ask your doctor

It is important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your doctor.

when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

Second opinion

It is normal to want to start treatment as
soon as possible. While cancer should not
be ignored, there is time to have another
doctor review your test results and suggest a
treatment plan. This is called getting a second
opinion, and it’s a normal part of cancer care.
Even doctors get second opinions!

It’s your choice
In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.

Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.



What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Support groups

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished
with treatment. If your hospital or community
doesn’t have support groups for people
with cancer, check out the websites listed
in this book.

Questions to ask your doctor
Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on this page and the following pages.
Feel free to use these or come up with your
own. Be clear about your goals for treatment
and find out what to expect from treatment.
Keep a notebook handy to record answers to
your questions.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
If you take the time to build a relationship with
your doctor, it will help you feel supported
