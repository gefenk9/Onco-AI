About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic
Lymphoma, Version 1.2025 – October 1, 2024.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia

Why you should
read this book

(CLL) is a type of blood cancer.
It grows slowly. Treatment
may not be needed for years.

Making decisions about cancer care
can be stressful. You may need to make
tough decisions under pressure about
complex choices.

Some patients may never need
treatment. However, for the
majority of patients who do, newer

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients
are trusted by patients and providers.
They clearly explain current care
recommendations made by respected
experts in the field. Recommendations
are based on the latest research and
practices at leading cancer centers.

What is CLL?
CLL stands for:

Cancer care is not the same for everyone.
By following expert recommendations
for your situation, you are more likely
to improve your care and have better
outcomes as a result. Use this book as
your guide to find the information you
need to make important decisions.

Chronic – a condition that doesn’t go
away
Lymphocytic – occurs in the
lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell
Leukemia – cancer that occurs in blood
cells

Put together, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a
condition in your lymphocytes that doesn’t go
away. It’s considered a form of cancer.

In people with CLL, abnormal B cells grow out
of control, crowding out healthy B cells.

Your blood contains several types of blood
cells. One of those is white blood cells.

This oversupply of abnormal B cells prevents
healthy B cells from performing their duties
effectively. This results in fewer healthy blood
cells and a higher risk of infection.

B cells, also called B lymphocytes, are one
type of white blood cell. They’re made within
the soft, spongy tissue inside most of your
bones called bone marrow. When they've
matured properly, B cells leave your bone
marrow to work in your bloodstream.

What are the symptoms of
CLL?





Usually, CLL doesn’t cause symptoms at first.
It may be found due to routine blood testing.

Feel tired more easily or fatigue



Excessive sweating or night sweats



Fever



The specific cause of CLL isn't currently known
other than that there is a change within the
bone marrow. It can be tied to several factors:

Swollen glands in your neck, or you feel
swelling in your stomach







Infections that keep coming back despite
treatment

Lymph system
Many B cells are in the lymph
(or lymphatic) system. This
system plays a key role
in fighting infections. The
tonsils, thymus, spleen, and
lymph vessels and nodes are
parts of the lymph system
(shown). There are hundreds
of lymph nodes in the body,
and many are in the neck,
armpits, and groin.

What causes CLL?

Symptoms of CLL may include the following.
See a health care professional as soon as you
can if you have any of these symptoms:

How is CLL treated?

Is there a cure for CLL?

Treatment of CLL depends on your body.
You may not need treatment right away. But
treatment may be needed if your white blood
cell count is rising rapidly, if you have low
numbers of other normal blood cells (anemia,
low platelets, or low neutrophils), if you have
large or uncomfortable lymph nodes, or if you
have symptoms listed above.

There is currently no cure for CLL, but you
can get effective treatment so your blood cells
will be mostly healthy ones and a full life is
possible. This is a condition called minimal
residual disease. We’ll describe this in a later
chapter.
While the goal of treatment is not to cure CLL,
the goal is to prevent the disease from causing
problems and from becoming life-threatening.

Many treatment options are available and
should be discussed with your doctor at your
first visit and as your condition is followed.
These range from pills you take every day to a
combination of IV infusions and pills taken for
a specific amount of time.

What is SLL?
Small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL, is the
same cancer as CLL. The only difference
between the two is where the abnormal cells
are found.

You may live for years without needing
treatment. If or when someone needs
treatment can vary greatly from person to
person.

CLL is mostly found in the blood and bone
marrow. SLL is mostly found in lymph nodes
and the spleen. If a person has more than
5,000 cancerous cells in their blood, it is
considered SLL. Anything less than that is
considered CLL.

You may have a more intense or aggressive
treatment plan if you develop Richter
transformation, which is described later. This
rare condition can lead to a more aggressive
cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) or another cancer called Hodgkin
lymphoma.

The lymph nodes and spleen play a key role in
fighting infections.
CLL can also be found in the lymph nodes.
Lymph nodes and the spleen may be swollen
because of a buildup of CLL or SLL cells.
Treatment of CLL and SLL is the same
because the cancer cells are the same. For
this book, treat any recommendation for CLL
as one for SLL. For this reason, the disease is
often referred to as CLL/SLL.

What can you do to get the
best care?
Advocate for yourself. You have an important
role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more
likely to get the care you want by asking
questions and making shared decisions with
your care team.

What's in this book?
This patient guide describes everything
you need to know about living with CLL,
including:

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help
you understand cancer care. With better
understanding, you’ll be more prepared to
discuss your care with your team and share
your concerns. Many people feel more
satisfied and less anxious when they play an
active role in their care.
You may not know what to ask your care
team. That’s common. Each chapter in this
book ends with an important section called
Questions to ask. These suggested questions
will help you get more information on all
aspects of your care.

Immunophenotype
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often has a common pattern of surface proteins on
its cells. An example of these proteins is CD20 (shown). It helps identify the correct type
of cancer. For instance, CLL cells have proteins called CD200 and LEF1, but another type
of lymphoma, called mantle cell lymphoma, does not have them.

marrow, and lymph node samples for signs of
disease.

Needle biopsies take a small sample of a
lymph node using a needle. They can be done
when other biopsies are not safe to perform.

The hematopathologist and your oncologist
will examine a drop of your blood using a
microscope. This is called a blood smear. The
way the abnormal cells look can be a clue as
to what type of cancer you have.

A lab test will be used to find the
immunophenotype of the biopsied cells.
A bone marrow biopsy removes a core sample
of marrow. A bone marrow aspiration removes
liquid and cells from the marrow. These
procedures are usually done at the same time.
They’re performed on the back of the hip bone.

Your blood will also be tested using a method
called flow cytometry. It can detect common
patterns of proteins on the outside of cells.
Most cells have an identifiable pattern of
proteins, like a silhouette or a shape, called the
immunophenotype.

You may receive an injected pain blocker or
light sedative to help you relax. Tests of bone
marrow aren’t usually needed for diagnosis, so
you might not get one.

A CLL diagnosis requires at least 5,000 or
more of the same white blood cells called
monoclonal B lymphocytes to be found per
microliter in your blood.

Diagnosis by biopsy
A biopsy is a procedure that removes samples
from the body for testing. If the blood results
aren’t clear, you’ll have a biopsy of your
lymph nodes or bone marrow to confirm CLL.
Tests of lymph nodes will also confirm small
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).
An excisional biopsy is when a whole lymph
node is removed by a surgeon, while an
incisional biopsy removes only part of a lymph
node.
There are many lymph nodes throughout your
body, so if you have a lymph node removed,
you won’t lose your ability to fight infections
and disease.

What tests are needed for
starting treatment?

Lab results used for diagnosis are included
in a report. This report will be sent to your
hematologist-oncologist, an expert in blood
cancers. You may be able to view the
pathology report using an online patient portal,
or you could ask for a copy.

The tests used to provide care are listed in
Guide 1 and are described next.

Health history
Expect your care team to review your health
in detail. This is known as taking a medical
history. They will want to know a lot about
your past and current health. You will likely be
asked about:

2 Testing for CLL » What tests are needed for starting treatment?

Some cancers and other health problems can
run in families. Be prepared to discuss the
health of your close blood relatives, like your
siblings, parents, and grandparents. These
are your first- and second-degree relatives, as
seen in the figure below. Relatives are 7 to 8
times more likely to develop CLL if there’s a
family history.

haven’t had a blood test recently, you’ll get a
complete blood count (CBC) with differential.




Physical exam
Your hematologist/oncologist will perform a
physical exam of your body. This exam will
include:





A differential counts the most common
types of white blood cells in your blood.
It also checks if the cell counts are in
balance with each other.

White blood cell counts are often high at
diagnosis of CLL. Other blood counts, such as
red blood cells or platelets, may be low.

Checking your vital signs—blood
pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and
body temperature—and assessing your
overall appearance

A comprehensive metabolic panel is a
screening test for many diseases. It often
includes tests for up to 14 chemicals in the
blood. Abnormal levels may mean your kidneys
and liver are not working as they should.

Feeling and listening to organs
Assessing your level of pain, if any, when
you are touched

Beta-2 microglobulin is a small protein found
on most cells. It is released by cells into
the blood by B cells. High levels of beta-2
microglobulin may suggest CLL is growing.

Checking for swelling
Cancer cells can build up in lymph nodes, the
spleen, and the liver causing them to swell.
Your oncologist will look at and gently press on
your body to assess their size. Areas that may
be touched include your neck, armpit, belly,
and groin.

Bone marrow tests
Bone marrow tests are not often needed to
diagnose CLL. However, they may be done to
find out what’s causing low blood cell counts.

Performance status
Performance status is your ability to do daily
activities, like feeding yourself or bathing. Your
oncologist will score your performance status
based on your health history and exam.

Biomarker tests
CLL cells have unique features that can be
used to plan treatment specifically for you.
These features are called biomarkers.

Blood tests

Biomarkers are found with lab tests using
either a blood or bone marrow sample:

Blood tests can measure blood cells, proteins,
and chemicals in the bloodstream. If you

of genetic material called chromosomes.
It can detect a biomarker called 17p
deletion.




A CT scan is done in the radiology department,
in a big machine that looks like a tunnel. The
scan won’t hurt, but if you need contrast you
will need to get a needle placed in your arm.

DNA sequencing is used to look for
mutations in the TP53 and IGHV genes,
which control how your cells die when
they’re not healthy.

A radiologist will review your scans and send
the results to your oncologist.

A karyotype can show defects in
chromosomes. A complex karyotype is 3
or more unrelated changes or deletions in
more than one cell.

“

Biomarkers used to select treatment are
discussed in Chapter 4: Treatment for CLL.

I am so grateful I had
a consultation with a CLL
specialist. It was reassuring to
finally speak to a CLL specialist.
The doctor answered all my
questions thoroughly. I am
very satisfied with the advice I
received."

Diagnostic CT
Computed tomography, or CT, is like an
x-ray but it shows body tissue more clearly. A
diagnostic CT uses more radiation than regular
CT and adds a contrast agent. Some people
refer to this as a CAT scan.
A contrast agent is a chemical that highlights
body tissues for the scanner. It’s given to you
through a needle placed into a vein in your
arm. Some people can’t have contrast due to
certain health issues, like allergies or chronic
kidney disease. Ask if contrast is safe for you.
A diagnostic CT of your chest, abdomen, and
pelvis may be needed for 2 reasons:




To look for big lymph nodes that may be
causing symptoms
To assess the extent of the cancer before
starting treatment

Since a CT scan is often not needed, you
should ask your doctor what the reason is to
obtain the test.

2 Testing for CLL » What if I’m pregnant?

What if I’m pregnant?

You may receive a referral to a fertility
specialist. A fertility specialist is an expert in
helping people have babies. They can explain
how you may be able to have a baby during or
after treatment. Collecting and freezing sperm
or eggs is a common method.

Some cancer treatments can harm an unborn
baby. If you have the potential to become
pregnant, your cancer care team will give you
a pregnancy test before treatment.
Your treatment options will depend on the
results.

More information on fertility preservation can
be found in the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®:
Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer, available
at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Preserving fertility
Many people have healthy babies despite
cancer and its treatment. If you wish to have
kids, there are important steps to take before
treatment. Even if you are unsure, talk to your
cancer care team.
Fertility is the ability to have a baby. Some
cancer treatments can damage the body parts
needed for fertility. Ask your care team if you’re
at risk for impaired fertility. It can happen to
people of any gender.

Cancer treatment can impact
one's ability to have children.
Before starting treatment, talk
with a fertility counselor to
learn what your options are for
fertility preservation.

What’s a prognosis?

What’s next?

Prognosis is the likely course and outcome of
a disease based on tests. Prognosis is used to
predict how the cancer will turn out.

What happens next depends on what your
tests find. You may move on to a stage called
“watch and wait”. This means you won’t start
any treatment aside from those that make you
feel better if you’re sick. We’ll talk about this it
more in Chapter 3: Watch and wait.

Some people with CLL want to know the
prognosis, but others don’t. Tell your care team
what information you do and do not want to
know.

You could move on to treatment right away
if your care team feels you need to. We’ll tell
you all about what treatments you could use in
Chapter 4: Treatment for CLL.

Some people with CLL have certain
biomarkers that can be targets for
chemoimmunotherapy. More research is
needed to know how they predict the results of
targeted therapy. See Guide 2.

There’s a condition called Richter
transformation that we describe in Chapter 5:
Richter transformation. If your care team tells
you that you have this, we advise you to read
that chapter.

Beta-2 microglobulin is also a biomarker used
to determine how hard cancer will be to treat.
High levels may suggest that CLL will likely be
harder to treat.

Will I be okay without

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) isn’t always treated right
away. Your care team will check

You may start treatment for chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) months or years
after diagnosis. Or you may never need
treatment.

the cancer often and start
treatment when it’s needed. This
approach is called watch and wait.

Unlike other cancers, CLL grows very slowly.
A term your care team might use is “indolent”
(pronounced IN-doe-lint). Cancer that’s
indolent moves very slowly.

What is watch and wait?

Current research shows that delaying
treatment is safe for many people. There’s
research being done to find out whether
treatment should be delayed or started sooner.

Watch and wait is a period of testing for
changes in your condition. It can go on for
years. Your care team may call it observation,
active surveillance, or watchful waiting.

Reasons to delay treatment include:

Some people call this period “watch and
worry,” but your worry should fade over time.
During watch and wait, your care team will
monitor your symptoms and blood counts.





Meanwhile, you can take care of your health in
several ways:






First, go to your health appointments.
Don’t skip or delay them.



Second, find support. Watch and wait can
cause worry or anxiety. Support groups or
professional support may be helpful.



Treatment may cause unwanted health
problems called side effects which are
inconvenient and may have out-of-pocket
costs.
There may be better treatments available
in the future.
Treatment may never be required at all.

You can enroll in a clinical trial that assesses if
early treatment is helpful.

Third, live a healthy lifestyle to improve
your overall health.

See Chapter 6: Supportive care for information
to help you during watch and wait. This
chapter explains recommendations for
vaccines and care for cancer symptoms. It also
describes other NCCN resources that can help
improve your quality of life.

longer.

When does treatment
begin?

The 5 stages can be condensed into three risk
groups:


You won’t start treatment until the blood tests
have been done. Your cancer care team will
use staging to figure out where you are in your
treatment journey.





Rai stages
The Rai staging system is commonly used
for CLL. The Binet staging system is another
staging system used for CLL. The Rai and
Binet systems are often used together.

Stage 0 has a low risk of needing
treatment soon.
Stages 1 and 2 have an intermediate risk
of needing treatment soon.
Stages 3 and 4 have a high risk of
needing treatment soon. Treatment is
typically started within weeks to a few
months.

The Rai system consists of 5 cancer stages
ranging from stage 0 to stage 4. The criteria for

Why start treatment?
It’s important to talk with your oncologist about
starting treatment. Share your wishes and
concerns. Together, you can decide when it’s
time to start treatment.

I found focusing and staying in
touch with a small circle
of close friends who really care
about you helped build my
mental strength. It will be easy to
identify them, and the
good feeling you have after a text
or chat is great mental
strength fuel."

In general, oncologists recommend starting
treatment when the effects of cancer become
worse than the risks of treatment. At this point,
treatment may make you feel better.
A high white blood cell count by itself is
not a reason to treat CLL. Reasons to start
treatment are listed in Guide 4.

Guide 4
Reasons to start treatment
You can enroll in a clinical trial that assesses if early treatment is helpful.
You have major symptoms of CLL as described in Chapter 1: About CLL.
CLL is causing one or more of your organs to stop working properly.
Your spleen or lymph nodes have enlarged, are growing quickly, or are causing discomfort.
CLL is causing your red blood cell count to be low.
CLL is causing your platelet count to be low.
Your body doesn’t respond to steroids like it should (steroid-refractory autoimmune cytopenia).

“

In the past few years, there
have been new breakthroughs

I found tremendous comfort
in focusing on the things that
I could control, such as taking
medications as directed, taking
an active role in educating
myself about my disease and my
treatment plan, and ensuring
I asked for (and received) proper
care."

in treating chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL). Discuss the
treatment options in this chapter
with your family and your care
team. Treatment will be designed
specifically for you.

About treatment
A team of experts will provide your cancer
treatment and support you. Your team will be
led by a hematologist-oncologist—an expert in
treating blood cancers. Other common team
members include nurses, physician assistants,
patient navigators, social workers, and
specialists.



People with CLL are often treated over their
lifespans with a series of different treatments.
The first treatment given is referred to as firstline therapy. Second-line therapy is the second
treatment, and so on.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is treated
with cancer medicine, like pills, capsules,
or intravenous medicines. Some treatments
consist of one or more drugs. In this chapter,
preferred treatments are noted.

All treatments can cause unwanted health
problems called side effects. Side effects
vary from person to person. Ask your care
team for a list of possible side effects of your
treatments. Also, tell your care team about any
new or worsening symptoms you have. There
may be ways to help you feel better. Care for
key side effects is explained in Chapter 6:
Supportive care.

NCCN has 3 categories of preference for
treatments:




Preferred therapies have the most
evidence they work better and may be
safer than other therapies.
Other recommended therapies
may not work quite as well as preferred
therapies, but they can still help treat
cancer.

Therapies used in certain cases
work best for people with specific cancer
features or health circumstances.

4 Treatment for CLL » Will I need tests before treatment?

Will I need tests before
treatment?



CLL may change during watch and wait, and
after treatment starts. The cancer will be tested
before each line of treatment.



Biomarker tests


CLL differs between people. Differences in
how CLL behaves are caused by abnormal
changes in cancer cells. Not everyone
with CLL has the same abnormal changes.
Importantly, many of these changes can
be identified, so they’re called biomarkers.
Because biomarkers differ between people,
a treatment that helps one person might not
help you. That’s why it’s important to have
biomarker tests and get a treatment plan
specific to you.



TP53 mutation is an abnormal change
in the TP53 gene. This test is done
because the TP53 gene may be mutated
instead of missing (deleted). This is
different from the 17p deletion test.
IGHV mutation is an abnormal change
in the IGHV region genes. This biomarker
does not change over time. So testing is
only needed once.
A complex karyotype is 3 or more
unrelated defects in chromosomes that
occur in more than one cell.

Biopsy and imaging
NCCN experts recommend a bone marrow
biopsy and computed tomography (CT) scan
only if needed. Most people with CLL won't
need these tests.

NCCN experts recommend testing for the
following biomarkers before treatment:

A blood biomarker test is
needed to pinpoint which
treatments will work best
for you.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, 2025

A 17p deletion is a missing part of
chromosome 17 that contains the TP53
gene.

26

4 Treatment for CLL » Which treatment will I get first?

Which treatment will I get
first?

Your oncologist will choose a treatment
based on several factors. Biomarker testing
is important. If you have more than one
change in your DNA, it’s called a complex
karyotype. Having a complex karyotype may
limit how well BTK inhibitors work. Your age,
overall health, and other medications are also
important factors.

For many people with CLL, the first treatment
is targeted therapy. Targeted therapy works by
stopping how CLL cells grow and survive.




BTK inhibitors are oral medications that
target a protein called Bruton’s tyrosine
kinase (BTK) inside of CLL B cells. BTK
helps send a signal that tells the B cells
to grow. BTK inhibitors block BTK, which
stops the CLL cells from growing.

First-line therapy
First-line therapy is the first course of therapy
you’re given. The preferred first-line therapy
you have may be a BTK inhibitor, a BCL-2
inhibitor, or perhaps a combination of both.

BCL-2 inhibitors are oral medications
that target a protein called BCL-2 inside
of B cells. BCL-2 can prevent the cancer
cells from dying. BCL-2 inhibitors allow
the cancer cells to die.

BTK inhibitors such as acalabrutinib
(Calquence), zanubrutinib (Brukinsa), or
ibrutinib (Imbruvica) are taken for as long as
they are working. They are pills you take at
home.

Treatment pathways
There are many treatment options for CLL, but some are more commonly used than
others. Treatment for many people starts with either a BTK or BCL-2 inhibitor (shown
below). In time, most people will need a different treatment. Often, treatment is switched
from a BTK inhibitor to a BCL-2 inhibitor or the other way around. If you need a third
type of treatment after taking BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors, there are also many options.
One of these options is a PI3K inhibitor.

treatments for first-line therapy.

sometimes added to it. Zanubrutinib (Brukinsa)
is used by itself to treat CLL.
Ibrutinib (Imbruvica) often has very good
results but appears to cause more serious side
effects, including heart disease, than other
BTK inhibitors. A CD20 antibody may be used
with ibrutinib, but more research is needed on
these treatments.

Before starting a BTK inhibitor, your oncologist
may assess your risk for diseases that affect
your heart or blood vessels, commonly called
cardiovascular disease. BTK can cause
cardiovascular problems in rare cases.

Some people with CLL may prefer venetoclax
over BTK inhibitors. At first, venetoclax is
taken for 1 year and can reduce CLL to very
low levels. Taking venetoclax for a fixed time

One BTK treatment option is acalabrutinib
(Calquence). Obinutuzumab (Gazyva) is

may prevent CLL from becoming unresponsive
(resistant) to it.

If CLL grows, the type of treatment is often
switched. You may switch to a BTK inhibitor
after a BCL-2 inhibitor or the other way around.
Another option combines ibrutinib (Imbruvica),
a BTK inhibitor, and venetoclax (Venclexta), a
BCL-2 inhibitor.

Some research has been done on treatment
with both ibrutinib and venetoclax. This
treatment starts with taking only ibrutinib and
then adding venetoclax. It’s taken for a limited
amount of time.

There is a third option if CLL grows after
venetoclax (Venclexta) treatment is finished.
This growth is called progression, and CLL
may be treated with venetoclax again.
Venetoclax may be taken with a CD20
antibody for a limited time.

4 Treatment for CLL » What’s chemoimmunotherapy?

Obinutuzumab (Gazyva) is the preferred CD20
antibody. Venetoclax (Venclexta) may also
be used by itself or combined with rituximab
(Rituxan) for as long as it controls cancer
growth.

Almost all the drugs are given as a slow
injection called an infusion.

If treatment causes severe side effects, the
type of treatment is often switched. If you’re
taking a BTK inhibitor, the next option is to take
a different BTK inhibitor. A different inhibitor—
acalabrutinib (Calquence), zanubrutinib
(Brukinsa), or ibrutinib (Imbruvica)—may have
less severe effects.

Chemoimmunotherapy

Chemoimmunotherapy may also be started if
targeted therapy is not possible.

Chemotherapy alone was once the standard
treatment for CLL. Often, it didn’t have great
results. Experts now know that it doesn’t work
well for CLL with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation.
So chemotherapy is only an option for CLL
without 17p deletion and TP53 mutation.

In third-line treatment and any treatments that
follow, pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca) is sometimes
useful. It’s a BTK inhibitor that works differently
than other BTK inhibitors. It’s an option after
treatment with one or more of the other BTK
inhibitors.

First-line chemoimmunotherapy for CLL includes
CD20 antibodies. CD20 antibodies are a type
of immunotherapy. They include obinutuzumab
(Gazyva) and rituximab (Rituxan).
The fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and
rituximab (FCR) treatment works well for CLL
with IGHV mutations but can cause severe
side effects. So FCR is only recommended
for people who are under 65 years of age and
fairly healthy.

What’s
chemoimmunotherapy?
Most people start with targeted therapy, but
sometimes it’s useful to first treat CLL with
chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy.






Chemoimmunotherapy may be received when
first-line targeted therapy isn’t an option. It’s
also sometimes used if a rapid decrease in the
amount of cancer is needed. In these cases,
the options are bendamustine with either
obinutuzumab or rituximab, or obinutuzumab
with chlorambucil (Leukeran).

Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
like cancer.
Immunotherapy enables your immune
system to kill cancer.
Chemoimmunotherapy combines
chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

Immunotherapy alone
Immunotherapy (without chemotherapy) is
sometimes used for first-line therapy for the
same reasons as chemoimmunotherapy.
But it’s a treatment option for CLL with or
without 17p deletion and TP53 mutation.

Chemoimmunotherapy and immunotherapy
are given in cycles. One cycle is a period
of treatment days followed by days of rest.

Hematopoietic cell transplant

A recommended drug treatment, shown
in Guide 7. Many of these drugs work
differently than others you’ve had already.

To have a hematopoietic cell transplant, you
must not have major health problems other
than cancer. Most people with CLL do not get
a transplant.

Clinical trial
Experts are researching ways to better treat
CLL in people who’ve already tried BTK and
BCL-2 inhibitors. Ask your care team if there’s
a clinical trial that’s a good fit for you. A clinical
trial may provide access to a new way of
stopping CLL that isn’t available otherwise.

A hematopoietic cell transplant uses donor
cells to form healthy bone marrow. Bloodforming stem cells are collected from a close
relative or a stranger using a bone marrow
biopsy. These cells come from the bone
marrow and can develop into any type of blood
cell. This process is also known as allogeneic
cell transplantation.

Because of clinical trials, new treatments, such
as pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca), are now available
to everyone. For more information on clinical
trials, turn to the Clinical trials section in this
chapter.

It may take some time to get the transplant.
While you wait, you may get other treatments
to reduce spleen size and improve symptoms.

Doctors use a bone
marrow biopsy and
aspiration to remove
samples of solid bone
marrow and liquid bone
marrow for testing.
These samples are often
removed at the same
time on the pelvic bone.

A PI3K inhibitor like duvelisib (Copiktra) is
used by itself to treat CLL. Another PI3K
inhibitor, idelalisib (Zydelig), may be taken
with or without rituximab.
Alemtuzumab (Campath) is a CD52
antibody—a type of immunotherapy—
used to treat CLL. It marks the cancer
cells so that the immune system can find
and destroy the cells. Alemtuzumab may
be received with or without the CD20
antibody rituximab (Rituxan). This drug is
not used routinely for CLL.

Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is an
immunomodulatory drug for CLL. It
affects the immune system in multiple
ways. It’s used by itself or with rituximab
to treat CLL.
Chemoimmunotherapy is an option
only for CLL without 17p deletion
and TP53 mutation. Fludarabine,
cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR)
is an option for people who are under
65 years of age and healthy. Another
recommended chemoimmunotherapy
option is bendamustine (Bendeka) with
rituximab (Rituxan).
Immunotherapy can also be used after
BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors. One option
is obinutuzumab (Gazyva). Another is

information is also provided in an informed
consent form. This agreement confirms that
you’ve been fully told about your part in the
trial. Read the form carefully and ask questions
before signing it. Take time to discuss it with
people you trust. Keep in mind that you can
leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical
trial at any time.

To find out how well your treatment is working,
you’ll need to have tests to assess the
treatment response. These tests include an
updated medical history, physical exam, blood
tests, and sometimes imaging.

Will I get a placebo?

Types of responses

Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Based on tests, the response to treatment may
be one of the following:


Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. But you may need
to pay for other services, like transportation or
childcare, due to extra appointments. During
the trial, you will continue to receive standard
cancer care. This care is often covered by
insurance. If you are considering participation
in a trial, speak with a clinic social worker or
financial navigator to learn if financial or travel
assistance is available.







Complete remission is the best result.
With a complete remission, swollen
organs and lymph nodes are back
to normal size. You have no cancer
symptoms, like fever. Blood counts
are within normal range. No CLL cells
are detected in the bone marrow with
common tests.
Partial remission is a good result. Swollen
organs and nodes have shrunk to less
than half their size. Blood counts have
improved, but are not normal.
Stable disease is less than a partial
remission. CLL is not growing, but it
hasn’t gone away either.
Progressive disease means CLL is still
growing.

CLL not in remission
The next steps of treatment depend on the
type of outcome. Your treatment plan may not
change if CLL is stable. If CLL is growing, you'll
likely start a different type of treatment. For
some people, more tests are needed to plan
treatment.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, 2025

4 Treatment for CLL » Checking treatment responses

Testing for mutations
If you’re on a BTK inhibitor, CLL may not be
in remission because you may have BTK or
PLCG2 mutations. If tests find a mutation, you
may switch treatment if the cancer is growing.
If the cancer is stable, you can keep taking
the same BTK inhibitor because it may control
cancer growth for a couple of years.

There may be no CLL cells or too few to be
found by the most sensitive test. Despite these
great results, CLL may not be cured.

Relapse
CLL tends to worsen over time. But it may
take years before you need a new treatment.
The return of CLL after at least 6 months of
remission is called a relapse.

Testing for transformed CLL
If CLL is growing while on any type of
treatment, it may have transformed. CLL can
change into a faster-growing cancer, which is
described in Chapter 5: Richter transformation.
This doesn’t happen often. Transformed CLL is
confirmed by lab tests on a biopsy sample.

If you receive a BTK inhibitor by itself, it is
continued until there is a relapse or serious
side effects. At that time, a different treatment
may need to be started quickly.
At this point you may receive
chemoimmunotherapy and immunotherapy for
a limited time. For most people, venetoclax is
also taken for a fixed amount of time.

CLL in remission
After remission is achieved, your care team
will monitor the status of your CLL at regular
follow-up visits. You may continue to receive
treatment during remission.

If the amount of CLL is low and there are no
symptoms or side effects as a result of your
blood counts, then the BTK inhibitor may be
continued if that is the current treatment, or
you may be followed with watch and wait.

At visits, your medical history will be updated.
You’ll have a physical exam and blood tests.
Testing for minimal residual disease
When CLL is in complete remission, your
oncologist may want to test for minimal
residual disease, or MRD. After successful
treatment, there could still be a tiny amount
of cancer cells in the blood even though no
cancer cells can be seen with a microscope.
This tiny amount of cancer is called minimal
residual disease.

Swollen lymph nodes or a larger liver or spleen
are signs of a relapse. So is a large increase
in the number of white blood cells called
lymphocytes.
At relapse, treatment is started when there
are signs that it is needed. These signs are
explained in Chapter 4: Treatment for CLL.
A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell
therapy, lisocabtagene maraleucel (Breyanzi),
is recommended for relapsed CLL or if the CLL
is resistant to other medications.

Very sensitive lab tests are used to detect
minimal residual disease.
A finding of undetectable minimal residual
disease means the test detected no CLL cells.

“

In some people, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

I'm newly diagnosed and filled
with anxiety. I'm glad I joined an
educational webinar, it was very
helpful."

changes into an aggressive
disease. This change is called
Richter transformation or Richter
syndrome. It can occur before or
after treatment of CLL.

In rare cases, chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) can rapidly transform into a more
serious cancer. Most often, it transforms into
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Less
often, it changes into Hodgkin lymphoma.
In either case, this shift is called Richter
transformation.

Imaging may be used to select the best area to
sample. Options for imaging are a whole-body
PET/CT scan or a diagnostic CT scan of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Richter transformation can evolve from
mutations within CLL cells or from another B
cell. Richter transformation has a poor outlook.

A CT scan uses x-rays to generate a series of
cross-sectional images of the inside of your
body.

What tests are for Richter
transformation?

A PET/CT scan involves injecting a safe
radioactive chemical into your body. The care
team will then use a machine to see where the
chemical stays the most, which can pinpoint
places with lots of cancer cells.

Tests are needed to confirm Richter
transformation and plan treatment. These tests
are like those for CLL described in Chapter 3:
Watch and wait.

An excisional biopsy is when a whole lymph
node is removed by a surgeon, while an
incisional biopsy would remove part of one.

Confirming transformed CLL

A hematopathologist will examine and test the
lymph node samples. They will look for signs
of transformation, such as large and active
lymphoma cells.

Rapidly growing lymph nodes or masses or
high blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) can point to Richter transformation. A
biopsy, or sample, of lymph nodes is needed to
confirm the diagnosis.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, 2025

5 Richter transformation » How is Richter transformation treated?

If results from the lymph node biopsy aren’t
clear, a bone marrow biopsy may be done next.

If needed, your care team will also check if
you’re pregnant.

Planning treatment for Richter
transformation

How is Richter
transformation treated?

Your care team will ask about your current and
past health to obtain your medical history. Your
oncologist will examine your body and look for
enlarged lymph nodes and organs.

Treatment starts right after diagnosis. The goal
of treatment is to extend life.

You’ll need to get blood drawn through a
needle placed in your arm, so a complete
blood count (CBC) with differential and
comprehensive metabolic panel can be done.

Treatment is based on the type of lymphoma
CLL transformed into.

Additional tests on blood samples can help
plan supportive care. Tests of LDH can help
assess for a condition called autoimmune
hemolytic anemia. In this condition, your
immune system mistakenly attacks your red
blood cells, causing low blood levels.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors
consist of fast-growing, large B cells. They’re
commonly found in lymph nodes, spleen, liver,
bone marrow, or other tissues and organs.

DLBCL

Symptoms can include fever, night sweats,
fatigue, and weight loss. These symptoms are
referred to as B symptoms. Not everyone has
the same symptoms and tumors can be found
anywhere in the body. The treatments that are
recommended depend on whether DLBCL
evolved from CLL cells.

Tests of uric acid levels can show if you’ve
developed tumor lysis syndrome.
Old viruses in your body may reactivate, so
testing for Epstein-Barr and hepatitis viruses
is useful. Read Chapter 6: Supportive care for
information on supportive care.

For DLBCL that evolved from CLL cells, a
clinical trial is preferred. Ask your care team if
there is an open trial that’s a good fit for you.
If a clinical trial is not an option, rituximabbased chemoimmunotherapy is often used for
treatment, but BTK and immune checkpoint
inhibitors are also options. See Guide 8.
Also, new treatments may be available through
clinical trials.

Depending on your treatment options, you
might get a heart scan or a human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) test. A scan of your heart is
needed to decide if a drug called anthracycline
is safe. An HLA test is needed to find a donor
for a hematopoietic cell transplant.
Some cancer treatments can damage
reproductive organs and harm unborn babies.
You may receive a referral to a fertility
specialist before starting cancer treatment.

5 Richter transformation » How is Richter transformation treated?

If DLBCL did not evolve from CLL cells, the
standard treatment recommendations for
DLBCL are followed. These recommendations
for treating DLBCL are available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

A clinical trial is the preferred treatment
for Richter transformation to Hodgkin
lymphoma. The other recommended option
is chemotherapy treatments. Treatment
information for Hodgkin lymphoma is available
at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Hodgkin lymphoma
In Hodgkin lymphoma, lymphocytes appear
abnormally large and may have more than
one nucleus. A nucleus is the control center of
the cell.

6 Supportive care » What vaccines should I get?

This chapter describes some of the unique
needs of people with CLL. People with CLL are
more likely than other people to get infections,
develop second cancers, and have other
health problems. This chapter also lists NCCN
resources on supportive care.

NCCN experts recommend these vaccines for
people with CLL:




What vaccines should I get?


You can protect yourself by being up to date
on your vaccines. Vaccines help prevent
infections by training your body to quickly
recognize and attack germs. They contain
whole germs, parts of a germ, or a product of
a germ, so your body can defend itself against
future exposure.





Pneumococcal vaccine, as recommended
by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC)
Non-live (recombinant, adjuvanted) zoster
vaccine to prevent shingles, if you're
taking a BTK inhibitor
COVID-19 vaccine (any type is
acceptable)
RSV for people over 65 years of age

COVID-19

Avoid live vaccines

More research is needed to learn how well the
COVID-19 vaccine works among people with
CLL. The vaccine may not fully protect you, but
there are additional ways to protect yourself.

You should avoid getting live vaccines
unless approved by your oncologist. Live
vaccines contain an entire germ that has
been weakened (attenuated). They create a
strong immune response to the real germ. Live
vaccines may cause major health problems in
people with weaker immune systems.

If there are a lot of COVID-19 cases in your
area, protect yourself. Wear a mask. Keep a
safe distance from others. Thoroughly wash
your hands often.

Get recommended vaccines

If you do get COVID-19, there are treatments
for it. Some COVID-19 treatments, like
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), can interact
with BTK inhibitors and venetoclax. While
being treated for COVID-19, your oncologist
might pause your cancer treatment.

Vaccines are proven to be safe and effective
in preventing serious illness. Some vaccines
are routine. Others are based on age, health,
and other factors. Talk to your care team about
which vaccines you need.

6 Supportive care » CLL-related infections

CLL-related infections

zoster virus causes chickenpox, and when
reactivated in older people, shingles.

Normally, there are germs in the body that are
harmless. But when cancer treatments weaken
the body’s immune system, these germs can
cause serious infections. Weakened immunity
can also cause routine infections to be more
severe. These unusual and severe infections
are called opportunistic infections.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Sulfatrim,
Bactrim) is a combined drug used to
prevent pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is a lung
infection caused by a common fungus.

Medicine used to treat infections can also be
used for prevention. Preventive care is based
on the type of treatment for CLL. Some cancer
treatments weaken the immune system more
than others.

Preventive care for herpes and fungal
pneumonia is recommended during
and after treatment with PI3K inhibitors,
chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine or
bendamustine, and alemtuzumab. If you’re
taking a BTK inhibitor, your oncologist will
provide preventive care and monitor for
infection.

Herpes and fungal pneumonia
Acyclovir (Zovirax) is an antiviral drug used to
prevent infections caused by herpes viruses.
These viruses include the herpes simplex virus
and the varicella-zoster virus. The varicella-

white blood cells called neutrophils can drop.
When levels of neutrophils are low, you’re

blood tests during treatment. The antibiotic
fluoroquinolone and antifungal medicines
help prevent infections caused by venetoclaxinduced neutropenia.

People with CLL are at higher risk of getting
other cancers, so regular cancer screening is
important. There are screening programs for
prostate, breast, cervical, lung, and colorectal
cancers.

Hepatitis
If you’ve had hepatitis B, it may come back
during cancer treatment. Entecavir (Baraclude)
is the preferred medicine to prevent and
treat hepatitis B. Other options are adefovir,
telbivudine (Tyzeka), and tenofovir (Viread).
Preventive care may continue for up to 12
months after cancer treatment ends.

People with CLL are also at higher risk for
melanoma and other skin cancers. Your risk
is further increased if you sunburn easily or
had major sun exposure as a child. See a
dermatologist once a year for a skin exam.

There’s a link between hepatitis C and B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Direct-acting
antiviral agents such as sofosbuvir (Sovaldi)
safely treat hepatitis C and may reduce
lymphoma cells.

What’s autoimmune
cytopenia?

Cytomegalovirus
If you’ve had cytomegalovirus, there’s a high
risk of cytomegalovirus reactivation when taking
a PI3K inhibitor or alemtuzumab (Campath).
Screening for reactivation should be done
at least every 4 weeks. Reactivation may be
prevented with the antiviral ganciclovir (Zirgan).

Autoimmune cytopenia is a condition in which
your immune system attacks your blood cells.
There are several types. The most common
types among people with CLL are autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated
thrombocytopenia, and pure red cell aplasia.
There are multiple treatment options for
autoimmune cytopenia. Drug treatments
include corticosteroids, rituximab, IVIG,
cyclosporin A, eltrombopag, and romiplostim.
If steroids don’t work or the cytopenia returns,
BTK inhibitors may be used for treatment.

Treating ear, sinus, and lung
infections
Some people with CLL get frequent, serious
infections in their ears, sinuses, and lungs.
Your oncologist will prescribe an antimicrobial,
such as an antibiotic.

For some cytopenias, surgery may be
an option. The spleen plays a key role in
destroying platelets. Removing the spleen,
called a splenectomy, can help restore the
number of platelets.

If your body isn't making enough
immunoglobulin, you may receive purified,
donated immunoglobulin in addition to an
antimicrobial. Intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) is received every month through a
needle placed in your arm, or you can get
injections under the skin every week.

6 Supportive care » What’s tumor lysis syndrome? » What if I’m bleeding or bruising?

What’s tumor lysis
syndrome?

How should blood clots be
treated?

Several treatments for CLL kill many cells
quickly, such as:

Lenalidomide may cause blood clots.



Chemoimmunotherapy



Venetoclax



Lenalidomide



Obinutuzumab

A blood clot is a clump of blood that may block
blood vessels. Clots can be dangerous. If
you’re not taking an anticoagulant, clots can be
prevented with aspirin while on lenalidomide.
Aspirin is not needed if you are taking an
anticoagulant like warfarin (Coumadin).

Tumor lysis syndrome occurs when the
waste released by dead cells is not quickly
cleared out of the body. This may result in
kidney damage and severe blood electrolyte
disturbances. It can be life-threatening.

If not taking lenalidomide, your chance for
blood clots may still be high. More information
on blood clots and cancer is available at
NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Tumor lysis syndrome may be prevented with
hydration. Drink lots of water. You may also
get fluid infused into your bloodstream via a
needle placed into a vein in your arm..

What if I’m bleeding or
bruising?

Medicines that lower uric acid can help, too.
These medicines include allopurinol (Aloprim,
Zyloprim), febuxostat (Uloric), or rasburicase
(Elitek). Some people are admitted to the
hospital before starting treatment.

BTK inhibitors increase the risk of bleeding
and bruising. Your oncologist will monitor your
bleeding risk based on all factors. Regular
blood tests are very important since bleeding
risk increases when platelets are low.

What’s tumor flare?

When taking a BTK inhibitor, NCCN experts
recommend taking only 1 or 2 medicines that
increase bleeding risk at the same time. It
may be okay to take a BTK inhibitor and either
aspirin or an anticoagulant. But taking a BTK
inhibitor, antiplatelet, and an anticoagulant at
the same time is risky.

Lenalidomide may also cause tumor flare.
Tumor flare is a fast, short-lived increase
in cancer growth. Symptoms of tumor flare
include enlarged lymph nodes or spleen, lowgrade fever, and rash.
Steroids can prevent and treat tumor flare.
Preventive care is typically started if lymph
nodes are big. The skin rash and itchiness
caused by the flare can be treated with
antihistamines.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, 2025

If you need surgery, your oncologist may
pause the BTK inhibitor to prevent major
bleeding. The inhibitor is put on hold for 3
days before and after minor surgery. For major

surgery, treatment is paused for 7 days before
and after surgery.

Will I need blood
transfusions?

The full library of NCCN Guidelines for
Patients has several books on supportive
care. These books focus on the treatment of
common physical and emotional effects of
many cancers.

Some people being treated for CLL need a
blood transfusion. The transfusion should be
done according to hospital standards. All blood
should be treated with radiation before the
transfusion. This will prevent the rare event of
transfused blood attacking your body.

The library of NCCN Guidelines for Patients is
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and
on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Distress
Everyone with cancer feels distress at some
point. It’s normal to feel worried, sad, helpless,
or angry. Distress can become severe and
affect the way you live.

Fatigue

Immunotherapy side effects

Cancer-related fatigue is not the typical
tiredness that follows an active or long day. It’s
a lack of energy that is distressing, does not
improve with normal rest or sleep, and disrupts
life.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are used to treat
some types of Richter transformation. This
treatment may cause your immune cells to
attack your healthy cells. Immune-related side
effects can occur during or after treatment.

Palliative care

CAR T-cell therapy side effects
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy
can cause serious side effects, including
nervous system dysfunction. If you’re having
CAR T-cell treatment, review the NCCN
Guidelines for Patients: Immunotherapy Side
Effects: CAR T-Cell Therapy.

Palliative care is an approach to health care for
people living with serious illnesses, including
cancer. It focuses on providing relief from the
symptoms and stress of having cancer.

Nausea and vomiting

Late and long-term effects

Both chemotherapy and radiation therapy
can cause nausea and vomiting. Nausea is
the feeling that you are going to throw up.
Vomiting is forcefully throwing up what’s in
your stomach. Treatments are available to help
with both complications.

Cancer and its treatment can cause long-term
and late effects. Long-term effects start during
treatment and persist after treatment is done.
Less often, effects start long after treatment
has ended. Late and long-term effects include
fatigue, poor sleep, pain, and depression.

Anemia and neutropenia

Healthy living

Chemotherapy often causes a drop in red and
white blood cells. You’re more likely to get
infections when white blood cell counts are
low. This is called neutropenia. A low number
of red blood cells, called anemia, may cause
fatigue.

People with cancer need to start or maintain
a healthy lifestyle. Healthy living may help
prevent disease and improve well-being.
Topics covered in this book include physical
activity, food, tobacco use, and sun protection.

Graft-versus-host disease
A possible side effect of hematopoietic cell
transplant is graft-versus-host disease.
This side effect is caused by the donor cells
attacking your healthy cells.





People with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) are at risk for infections. Protect
yourself by getting vaccinations but avoid
attenuated vaccines because they contain
live germs.



Certain treatments for CLL can weaken
the immune system. You may take
medicines to prevent infections caused by
weakened immunity. If you get frequent,
severe infections, immunoglobulin may be
added to your treatment.
People with CLL are at risk for second
cancers. Don’t skip cancer screenings, as
they can help detect new cancers early.
Advanced CLL and some CLL treatments
may cause your immune system to
attack your blood cells. This is called
autoimmune cytopenia. There are multiple
treatment options including steroids.
Several treatments for CLL may cause
tumor lysis syndrome. Drinking water
and staying hydrated help prevent this
syndrome by removing dead cells from the
body. Uric acid reducers may help, too.
A tumor flare is a rapid increase in cancer
growth right after starting lenalidomide.
It’s treated with steroids. Lenalidomide
may also cause blood clots. Aspirin or an
anticoagulant like warfarin (Coumadin)
help prevent clots.
