About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.

These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for B-Cell Lymphomas, Version 4.2023 — June 2, 2023.

more years to live.

What is mantle cell
lymphoma?

Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells.
Cancer cells develop genetic errors that
cause them to make many more cancer
cells. The cancer cells crowd out and
overpower normal cells.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is cancer that
develops from certain white blood cells called
lymphocytes. Lymphocytes normally protect
the body from infection. An abnormal growth
of lymphocytes is a form of cancer called a
lymphoma. A lymphoma commonly affects the
lymph system but it can also affect other parts
of the body.

Cancer cells avoid normal cell death. They
also can spread far through blood vessels
or lymphatic vessels to other areas of the
body. They can replace many normal cells
and cause organs to stop working.

What is the lymph system?

Scientists have learned a great deal about
cancer. As a result, today’s treatments work
much better than treatments in the past.
Also, many people with cancer have more
than one treatment choice.

The lymph system is part of the immune
(infection-fighting) system. The lymph system
transports fluids to the bloodstream and fights
germs. It’s made up of lymph, lymph nodes,
and other organs.
Lymph is a fluid that contains germ-fighting
lymphocytes. Lymph nodes (sometimes called
“glands”) are small, bean-shaped structures.
Hundreds of lymph nodes are located
throughout your body. As lymph fluid travels
through the body, lymph nodes catch and filter
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mantle Cell Lymphoma, 2023

out foreign particles and harmful cells. Lymph
nodes are usually clustered in groups in your
neck, chest, armpits, groin, pelvis, and along
your gut. The spleen, tonsils, and thymus are
also part of the lymph system.
5

MCL basics » What is a mantle cell? » What causes mantle cell lymphoma?

When you get an infection, an army of
lymphocytes fills up your lymph nodes to fight
the germs. That’s why the lymph nodes in your
neck feel swollen when you have a cold, flu, or
sinus infection.

Lymph nodes
There are hundreds of small bean-shaped
structures throughout the human body
called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes catch and
filter out foreign particles and harmful cells,
including cancer cells. Groups of lymph
nodes are clustered in your neck, chest,
armpits, groin, pelvis, and along your gut.
Together, they form the lymph system.

What is a mantle cell?
A mantle cell is a type of B cell inside lymph
nodes.
Inside each lymph node are little round clumps
of cells called follicles which play a key role in
the immune system. Follicles contain mostly B
cells, a type of lymphocyte that fights bacteria,
viruses, and other pathogens. When a foreign
substance enters the lymph node, these cells
spring into action to break up the substance
and get rid of it.

Lymph
nodes

As part of this process, many of the follicle cells
group together into something like a boxing ring,
called the germinal center. Inside the germinal
center, the cells attack the foreign substance.
Other follicle cells form a circle around the
germinal center, like an audience surrounds
the boxing ring. This outside area is called the
mantle zone. Mantle cell lymphoma arises from
B cells in this region of the lymph node.

What causes mantle cell
lymphoma?
Like many cancers, researchers aren’t sure
what causes some people to develop this
type of lymphoma. In most people, no specific
cause can be identified.
MCL occurs when lymphocytes develop a
genetic change that causes them to start

overproducing a protein called cyclin D1.
This protein stimulates these altered cells to
grow out of control and become lymphoma
cells. No one knows exactly what causes
the mantle zone cells to develop this
genetic change, but researchers are
working on it.

Where is the mantle zone?
In the same way that an audience surrounds
a boxing ring, the mantle zone surrounds the
germinal center of a follicle, which is a clump
of cells inside a lymph node.

Follicle

How common is mantle
cell lymphoma?

Mantle zone

MCL is rare. It occurs in about 1 out of
200,000 people each year in the United
States. MCL is most frequently found in
older adults—the average age at diagnosis
is in the mid-60s.

Germinal
center

MCL is one of more than 70 different types
of lymphomas. These are divided into two
categories: Hodgkin lymphoma and nonHodgkin lymphoma. MCL is a subtype of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma that's less common
than most other subtypes.

Lymph node
Follicle

MCL usually grows quickly over weeks to
months. Doctors describe quick-growing
cancers as “aggressive.” However, for some
people, MCL grows slowly. Cancer that
grows slowly is referred to as “indolent.”
As a result of these differences, each
person should have individualized care and
attention to their symptoms and test results
to determine the best plan of action.

It’s important to identify your specific type
of lymphoma to make sure you get the right
care and treatment.

MCL basics » How is mantle cell lymphoma identified?

How is mantle cell
lymphoma identified?
Mantle cell lymphoma is often discovered
when a person has painless, swollen lymph
nodes in the neck, armpit, or groin. The lymph
nodes swell up because of the overgrowth of
lymphoma cells. The medical term for swollen
lymph nodes is called lymphadenopathy.
Other symptoms may include fever, drenching
sweats at night, unexpected weight loss,
fatigue, and stomach upset or pain.

What does aggressive mean?
When medical professionals describe
cancer as aggressive, they mean the
cancer is growing or spreading more quickly
than average.

Besides the lymph nodes, MCL is commonly
found in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, blood
stream, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI
tract is made up of the stomach, intestines,
and other organs that help digest food.

Aggressive is also used to describe a
treatment that’s stronger or more intense
than usual.

MCL is usually found in multiple parts of the
body when it’s first diagnosed. This is referred
to as advanced disease. In rare cases, MCL
may be limited to a smaller area. This is
referred to as localized disease. Advanced
disease and localized disease are treated
differently. Multiple tests—like blood tests,
genetic tests, and imaging scans—are needed
to make sure it’s MCL and not another disease
or other type of cancer. These tests also find
out how widespread the lymphoma is.

Can mantle cell lymphoma
be cured?
MCL is usually a lifelong disease. But
treatment can slow down its growth, reduce
its symptoms, and prolong your life. For many
people, treatment can put MCL into remission.
Remission means there are no symptoms
or signs of cancer. Remission may last for
months or years. Often, MCL comes back and
needs more or stronger treatment.

Because MCL is a less common form of
lymphoma, it can sometimes be difficult to
diagnose and treat. If possible, seek out a
medical center that specializes in lymphomas.
You can also ask for a second opinion.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mantle Cell Lymphoma, 2023

Treatments for MCL include chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation
therapy, stem cell transplant, cellular therapy,
or a combination of these treatments.

MCL is a lymphoma of B cell
lymphocytes. It forms in B cells from the
mantle zones of lymph nodes. It can also
develop in the spleen, liver, GI tract, and
bone marrow.
MCL is one of more than 70 different
types of lymphomas. MCL is a less
common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
MCL is often discovered when a person
has painless, swollen lymph nodes in the
neck, armpit, or groin. Other common
symptoms of MCL include fevers and
night sweats.
MCL is usually diagnosed as an advanced
lymphoma where the disease has
developed in several areas of the body.
MCL is usually an aggressive disease,
which means it can grow quickly.
However, some people have a slowgrowing (indolent) type of the disease.
MCL can sometimes be difficult to
diagnose and treat. Seek out a medical
center that specializes in lymphomas, if
possible. Also, ask for a second opinion.
MCL is usually a lifelong disease, but it
can be treated and controlled. Often, it
comes back and needs more treatment.

B symptoms:

A variety of tests are needed to find out if
you have cancer and to determine how far
the cancer has grown. Tests are used to plan
treatment and to check how well treatment
is working. If you haven’t already been
diagnosed, this chapter will help you know
what tests you may have and what to expect
during testing. Bring someone with you to
listen, ask questions, and write down the
answers.

Fevers

Unexplained weight loss

MCL may also affect your gastrointestinal
(GI) tract and bone marrow. GI symptoms
occasionally occur. These may include
diarrhea, bloody stools, and pain in your
abdomen.

Family history

Health history

Some cancers and other health conditions can
run in families—although very few people with
lymphoma have close relatives who also had
it. Be prepared to discuss the health problems
of your close relatives, especially your brothers
and sisters, parents, and grandparents.

Your doctors need to have all of your health
information. They’ll ask you about any
health problems and treatments you’ve had.
A complete report of your health is called
a medical history. Medical history, health
exams, and other health tests that are used to
diagnose MCL and prepare for treatment are
listed in Guide 1.

neck, armpits, and groin. Your doctor will also
feel your spleen and liver to assess their size.

A physical exam of your body is done to look for
signs of disease. It’s also used to help assess
what treatments may be options for you.

Daily activities ability

Checking for swelling

Your doctor or health care provider will also
rate your overall health and ability to do basic
daily activities like walking, cleaning, bathing,
and so forth. This is known as performance
status. Doctors do this to help find the best
treatment suited for you.

Certain parts of your body should be checked
for swelling. Swelling of lymph nodes
(lymphadenopathy) is often the first sign of
MCL. Lymph nodes may be so swollen that
they can be easily felt or seen under the skin.
Your doctor will gently press on the areas of

Testing for MCL » Blood tests

Blood tests

Comprehensive metabolic panel

MCL can cause abnormal blood counts.
Doctors test blood to look for this and other
signs of disease. Blood tests are also used to
learn when treatment should begin. A sample
of your blood is removed with a needle inserted
into a vein. This is called a blood draw.

Your liver, bone, and other organs release
chemicals into your blood. A comprehensive
metabolic panel includes tests for up to 14 of
these chemicals. The tests show if the levels
of chemicals are too low or high. Abnormal
levels can be caused by cancer or other health
problems.

Tests that may be done with your blood sample
include:

LDH

CBC with differential

High levels of the protein lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) can be caused by
cancer or other health problems. If related to
lymphoma, high levels of LDH may be a sign
that treatment may be needed soon.

A complete blood count (CBC) measures
parts of the blood. Test results include
measurements of white blood cells, red blood
cells, and platelets. Cancer and other health
problems can cause low or high counts.

Beta-2 microglobulin

There are five types of white blood cells. A
“differential” counts the number of each type
of white blood cell. It also checks if the cell
counts are in balance with each other.

High levels of beta-2 microglobulin can be
caused by cancer as well as other health
problems, like kidney disease.

Swollen glands
Swelling of lymph nodes (such as
the “glands” in your throat) is often
one of the first signs of mantle cell
lymphoma. Lymph nodes may be
so swollen that they can be easily
felt or seen under the skin. Your
doctor will gently press on the
areas of your body that have lymph
nodes, such as your neck, armpits,
and groin.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mantle Cell Lymphoma, 2023

Testing for MCL » Biopsies

Uric acid

Biopsies

Uric acid is released by cells when DNA
breaks down. You may have a high level of
uric acid before starting treatment. Levels can
be high due to fast-growing cancer, kidney
disease, or other health problems.

The only way to be sure that you have cancer
is to test fluid or tissue for cancer cells. A
biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample
of fluid or tissue for testing. There are several
types of biopsies.

Hepatitis test

Lymph node biopsy

Some types of cancer treatments can weaken
your immune system. This increases your
chance of getting infections. Hepatitis B and
hepatitis C infections in particular can become
active again from certain cancer therapies. So,
it’s important to be tested for hepatitis viruses.

For B-cell lymphomas like MCL, experts
from NCCN advise getting an incisional or
excisional biopsy of the lymph node(s). These
biopsies remove lymph node tissue through a
cut into your skin.
In certain situations, a core needle biopsy may
be necessary if the lymph node is difficult to
get to. For a core needle biopsy, the doctor
(usually a radiologist) uses CT or ultrasound
imaging to guide a long, hollow needle to
obtain a sample of the lymph node tissue.

Bone marrow biopsy
MCL can develop in bone marrow, which is
part of the lymph system. A bone marrow

Biopsy
A lymph node biopsy is a
minor surgical procedure
to remove a part or a whole
lymph node. In this photo, the
doctor is using an ultrasound
monitor to locate the area in
the body to be biopsied. After
the procedure, the biopsy
sample is tested to find out if
it has cancer cells.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®

14

Testing for MCL » Imaging

Imaging

biopsy removes a core of bone and soft bone
marrow. A bone marrow aspiration removes
liquid bone marrow. Both procedures may be
done at the same time. The samples will be
sent to a lab for cancer testing.

Imaging makes pictures of the insides of your
body. It’s used to detect cancer in deep lymph
nodes, organs, bone marrow, and other parts
of the body. It provides useful information to
determine the extent of cancer involvement.

GI biopsy

PET/CT

Compared with other types of lymphoma, MCL
is more likely to involve the GI tract. To see
inside the GI tract, doctors use procedures
called endoscopy and colonoscopy. A device
called an endoscope is used in the upper GI
tract. A device called a colonoscope is used in
the lower GI tract. Samples of tissue that may
have cancer will be removed and tested.

Positron emission tomography (PET) and
computed tomography (CT or CAT scan) are
two types of imaging. When used together,
they’re called a PET/CT scan. The PET/CT
scan is used to image your whole body.
Some cancer centers have one machine that
does both tests at the same time.

Lumbar puncture



A lumbar puncture is a procedure that removes
a sample of spinal fluid. It’s also called a spinal
tap. Your doctor may suspect that the cancer
is in spinal fluid based on symptoms or the
cancer type.

PET/CT scan
This is a PET/CT scanner.
Imaging instruments, like this
one, can show what’s going on
inside your body. During the
scan, you lie down on a table
that moves into the tunnel of
the machine. The scan can
detect even small amounts of
cancer.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mantle Cell Lymphoma, 2023

15

PET scan shows where your lymphoma
has spread. A PET scan requires injecting
a substance called a radiotracer into your
bloodstream. The radiotracer is detected
with a special camera during the scan. It
highlights cells that may be cancerous.
Afterward, the radiotracer is passed out of
your body in your urine.

Testing for MCL » Diagnostic tests



For these tests, your blood and tissue samples
are sent to a laboratory. At the laboratory, a
doctor called a hematopathologist tests the
samples to look for signs (markers) of MCL.
Hematopathologists are experts at diagnosing
cancers of blood cells.

CT scan uses x-rays to take many
images of your body from different angles.
A computer then combines the pictures
to make a 3-D image. A CT scan of your
chest, belly area, and between your
hip bones is needed to help diagnose
MCL. You may also need a CT of your
neck to look for cancer in lymph nodes.
Sometimes a contrast agent (also
called contrast dye) is used to make
the pictures clearer. Contrast is injected
into the bloodstream and flushed out in
urine. The contrast may cause you to
feel flushed or get hives. Rarely, serious
allergic reactions occur. Tell your doctor or
the technician if you’ve had reactions to
contrast in the past.

Two tests they use are protein tests and
molecular tests.

Protein tests
The hematopathologist will test your samples
to look for proteins on the surface and inside
of cancer cells. The hematopathologist looks
for common patterns of proteins—like a
“signature”—in the sample. Finding, or not
finding, these proteins can reveal the type of
cancer.

Diagnostic tests

For example, MCL cells have high levels of
a protein called cyclin D1, as well as CD5,
CD20, and other specific proteins. On the
other hand, the proteins CD200 and LEF1
are usually missing in MCL. So, a sample that
contains the first group of proteins but doesn’t

Cancers of blood cells, like MCL, can be
difficult to tell apart. Diagnostic tests reveal
which cancer you have.

Translocation
A translocation means that parts
of two chromosomes are switched.
The translocation in mantle cell
lymphoma occurs when the bottom of
chromosome 11 switches places with
the bottom of chromosome 14. This
leads to an increase in cyclin D1, a
protein that helps control the cell cycle.
The presence of too much cyclin D1 is
one of the key features of MCL.

contain the second two proteins suggests a
diagnosis of MCL.

Diagnosis vs. Prognosis

Similarly, tests show that most people with
typical MCL produce the SOX11 protein. On
the other hand, having a low or absent level of
the SOX11 protein may indicate slow-growing
(indolent) MCL.

What’s the difference between your
diagnosis and your prognosis? These two
words sound alike but they’re very different.

Ki-67 is another protein that’s important in
MCL. High levels of Ki-67 are linked to a type
of MCL that grows quickly.

Diagnosis: The identification of an illness
based on tests. The diagnosis names what
illness you have.

The hematopathologist will also look at your
cells under a microscope to find any visible
abnormalities. For instance, large, rapidlydividing cells may indicate a rare subtype of
MCL called blastoid variant. This MCL subtype
may be seen at diagnosis or appear later on.
The blastoid variant grows faster and is more
difficult to treat than typical MCL.

Prognosis: The likely course and outcome
of a disease based on tests. The prognosis
predicts how your disease will turn out.

in your cells to find out if you have this genetic
abnormality.

Molecular tests

Other changes are also involved in MCL.
Certain abnormal changes in genes can
affect how well the cancer is likely to respond
to treatment. So it may be useful to test for
certain genes that have abnormal changes.
In particular, an abnormal change in the TP53
gene is linked to faster-growing MCL and poor
results with standard cancer treatment.

Genes and chromosomes contain the
instructions to make cells work and to make
new cells. Abnormal changes in genes
and chromosomes can lead to lymphoma.
Sometimes it helps to test for these changes.
The results can be used for diagnosis and
prognosis.
Most MCL cells are known to have a specific
change, called a translocation, in their
chromosomes. A translocation means that
parts are switched between two chromosomes.
The MCL translocation occurs when a part of
chromosome 14 trades places with a part of
chromosome 11. This translocation is what
causes cells to make too much cyclin D1, a
protein that helps control the cell cycle. Too
much of this protein leads to the development
of MCL. Using biopsy samples, the
hematopathologist can test the chromosomes

Mantle Cell Lymphoma, 2023

Heart tests
Some cancer treatments can damage your
heart. To plan treatment, your doctor may test
how well your heart pumps blood. You may get
an echocardiogram or multigated acquisition
(MUGA) scan. An echocardiogram uses sound
waves to make pictures of your heart. A MUGA
scan makes pictures using a radiotracer and
special camera.

Testing for MCL » Fertility and pregnancy

“

Fertility and pregnancy
Some cancer treatments may affect your ability
to conceive or bear children. However, options
are available. Sperm can be frozen and stored
in a sperm bank until after cancer treatment.
Eggs can be removed from ovaries and stored
for later use. Discuss your thoughts and
preferences with your doctors.

Report any unusual feelings
of sadness, loss of interest
in activities, anxiety, and
sleep problems to your doctor.
Many people experience these
feelings, and they should not go
untreated. ”

Some cancer treatments can harm an unborn
baby. If you might be pregnant now, get a
pregnancy test before your treatment. Also,
take steps to avoid getting pregnant or causing
a pregnancy during treatment. Your doctors
can tell you which birth control methods are
best to use.

Tips for testing
Results from blood tests, imaging studies,
and biopsies will be used to determine your
treatment plan. It’s important you understand
what these tests mean. Ask questions and
keep copies of your test results. Online
patient portals are a handy way to access
your test results.
Follow these tips for testing:
•

Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.

•

Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.

•

Get copies of blood tests, imaging
results, and reports about the specific
type of cancer you have.

•

Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.

•

Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.

alteration means there’s a greater risk
for aggressive, fast-growing lymphoma.
Standard cancer treatments don’t work as
well against this type of MCL, so there’s a
greater likelihood for poor results.

You’ll be rated on your ability to do
everyday activities. This is used to assess
whether certain treatments are good
options for you.
Blood tests will be done to look for signs
of cancer and other health problems.
A biopsy is the only way to be sure that
you have mantle cell lymphoma. Other
types of biopsies may also be needed.

Experts strongly recommend that people
with this type of high-risk MCL join an
appropriate clinical trial.

Imaging tests allow your care providers
to look inside your body to find signs of
cancer. Imaging also shows where the
cancer is located.
Protein tests identify a signature-like
pattern of proteins that can reveal
whether you have MCL or another type of
lymphoma.
Molecular tests can find certain genetic
changes that may confirm the diagnosis
and help understand your prognosis.
You may undergo heart tests to see if
you’re healthy enough to have certain
cancer treatments.
Some cancer treatments can harm an
unborn baby. If you might be pregnant,
get a pregnancy test before treatment.

Treatment options for advanced MCL are
partly based on how fast the cancer is growing.
Advanced MCL is described as aggressive
(fast growing) or indolent (slow growing). Most
people who are diagnosed with advanced MCL
have the aggressive kind.

work together to figure out the
best treatment for you.

Treatment decisions are based on different
factors such as your age, level of fitness
(performance status), and overall health. Often
the most important factor is the extent of the
cancer. Doctors classify this by cancer stage.

Treatment types
Treating MCL includes treatment of the cancer
and support for you.
MCL can be thought of as an ongoing
(chronic) disease. So, the aim of treatment
is to reduce symptoms, control the cancer,
get the lymphoma into remission, and extend
life. Researchers are always testing new
treatments. Newer treatments are helping
people with MCL live longer with fewer health
problems than before.

Cancer stage
A cancer stage is a number that stands for
the extent of cancer in the body. For mantle
cell lymphoma (MCL), the extent of cancer
depends on its locations. A lower number
means fewer areas of cancer development in
the body and a higher number means more.
This number is based mostly on the results
from your biopsies, blood tests, and imaging.

Not everyone receives the same treatment.
Also, some people can handle more intense
treatment while others cannot. Your doctor
will tailor your treatment based on the tests
described in Chapter 2.

Doctors use a specific rating system for most
lymphomas. This system includes four stages.
For treatment purposes, the stages are often
grouped together like this:

Current types of treatment include:

Chemoimmunotherapy

Stage 1 and stage 2 refer to the early
stages of MCL. These cancers haven’t
progressed to many locations in the body. MCL
is rarely diagnosed at these stages. For more
information about stage 1 and stage 2 mantle
cell lymphomas, see Chapter 5.

This treatment combines the use of
chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These
treatments used together are often more
effective than both treatments used separately.
Chemotherapy uses drugs to damage and
destroy rapidly dividing cells, like cancer cells.
Chemotherapy harms healthy cells, too. That’s
why chemotherapy can cause side effects.

Stage 3 and stage 4 are advanced stages
of MCL. In these stages, the lymphoma occurs
in lymph nodes in several areas in the body. It

Rituximab marks these cells so that your
immune system can find and destroy them.
Rituxan is given through an IV.

Some chemotherapy drugs are given through
an intravenous (IV) infusion into a vein in
your arm or another part of your body. Other
chemotherapy drugs can be taken as a pill.

For chemoimmunotherapy, some regimens
are intense and some are less intense. Good
results can be achieved with both types of
regimens. Intense regimens have more risk of
side effects, so they aren’t often given to older
adults or those with other health problems.

Chemotherapy is given in treatment cycles.
One cycle is made up of a few treatment days
followed by a period of rest. This lets the body
recover before the next cycle. One cycle is
often 3 or 4 weeks long. However, the cycle
schedule varies depending on which drugs are
used.

Corticosteroids

Immunotherapy consists of medicines
that are based on antibodies. Antibodies are
natural proteins of the immune system. They
help your body fight germs and other threats.

Corticosteroids (steroids) are drugs that
are often used to reduce swollen lymph
tissue. Prednisone and dexamethasone
are the two main corticosteroids used for
lymphoma treatment. They’re included in some
chemoimmunotherapy regimens. They may
be given as a pill, a liquid, or an IV injection.
(These are not the same kind of steroids that
bodybuilders use to get big muscles.)

Antibodies can also be made in a lab. These
antibodies are designed to treat specific types
of cancer. Rituxan (rituximab) is a monoclonal
antibody treatment for MCL. It recognizes
and attaches to a specific protein (CD20)
that’s found on the surface of most B cells.

Chemoimmunotherapy
Chemoimmunotherapy combines
chemotherapy and immunotherapy
treatments. These treatments
used together are often more
effective than both treatments used
separately.
Some chemotherapy drugs are given
through an intravenous (IV) infusion
into a vein in your arm. This patient
is receiving chemotherapy through a
subcutaneous IV access port in the
upper chest.

MCL treatment options » Treatment types

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy drugs attack certain
cancer cells to slow their growth and spread.
Targeted therapy harms normal cells less than
chemotherapy does.

What is a regimen?

There are three main targeted therapies for
MCL:






A regimen is a plan that defines the
dosage, schedule, and duration of a
treatment. Regimens for MCL often
include multiple drugs.

Kinase inhibitors. Kinases are
enzymes with many cell functions. A
kinase called Bruton’s tyrosine kinase
(BTK) helps cancerous B cells develop
and grow. Drugs that block BTK can
reduce the number of new MCL cells
that are made. These drugs, called
BTK inhibitors, include Imbruvica
(ibrutinib), Calquence (acalabrutinib),
Brukinsa (zanubrutinib), and Jaypirca
(pirtobrutinib). BTK inhibitors are oral
medicines given as capsules or tablets.

Immunomodulators
Immunomodulators are drugs that are
used in cancer care to boost the immune
system. Revlimid (lenalidomide) is an
immunomodulator that’s used to treat MCL. It’s
given as a capsule. Other drugs, like Rituxan
and Imbruvica, may be used with Revlimid.

BCL-2 inhibitors. BCL-2 is a protein
inside of B cells that helps prevent cell
death. BCL-2 can build up in cancer cells
and save them from dying. Venclexta
(venetoclax) is a drug that blocks the
effect of BCL-2. This allows the cancer
cells to self-destruct. Venclexta is given
as a pill. It’s currently in clinical trials for
treating MCL.

Observation
In some cases, no treatment is the right
treatment. For MCL, this may be the case with
slow-growing, indolent MCL that isn’t causing
any symptoms. While treatment may not be
necessary, having regular tests and visits is
recommended to see if the cancer begins to
grow. This is why it’s called observation. If
symptoms begin, treatment will also begin.

Proteasome inhibitors. Velcade
(bortezomib) is a drug that targets
proteasomes inside cancer cells.
Proteasomes are sometimes called the
cell’s “garbage disposal” because they
grind up and get rid of the cell’s waste.
Velcade halts the proteasomes from
working. This causes a pile-up of waste
within the cancer cell, which can poison
and kill it. Velcade is given through an IV
into a vein or under the skin.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mantle Cell Lymphoma, 2023

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays
to treat MCL. The x-rays damage the DNA in
cancer cells. This either kills the cancer cells or
stops new cancer cells from being made.

23

MCL treatment options » Treatment types

donor cells, which will form new, healthy
bone marrow and a new immune system.
The new immune system will then
attack cancer cells that weren’t killed by
earlier treatment. An allogeneic stem cell
transplant is only used in certain cases for
MCL treatment.

A very focused type of radiation, involved-site
radiation therapy (ISRT), is used for MCL that’s
confined to a limited area. ISRT targets only
the lymphoma in the lymph node or affected
area while avoiding the surrounding areas.
This reduces many of the side effects of
regular radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy may also be used for MCL
that comes back after treatment (relapse).

CAR T-cell therapy
This treatment may be used if
chemoimmunotherapy and targeted therapy
aren’t enough to halt the cancer. Chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a
treatment made from your own T cells. T cells
are lymphocytes that hunt and destroy cancer
cells, infected cells, and other damaged cells.
However, cancer cells learn how to hide from
your T cells, which allows the cancer to grow.
CAR T-cell therapy reprograms your natural T
cells to recognize and target cancer cells.

Stem cell transplant
A stem cell transplant replaces unhealthy,
damaged, or destroyed stem cells with healthy
stem cells. The healthy stem cells form new
bone marrow and new blood cells.
A stem cell transplant is an intense treatment.
So, it may not be part of your plan. (If it is,
it helps to plan ahead: Ask your doctor for
a referral to the transplant center early on.
Switching from chemoimmunotherapy to the
transplant may go more smoothly.)

First, your own T cells are removed from your
body using a special machine. A CAR is added
to your T cells in a laboratory. This genetically
alters the T cells to hunt specifically for cancer
cells. The CAR T cells are infused back into
your body where they find and kill MCL cells.

There are two types of stem cell transplants:




An autologous transplant is also
called high-dose therapy with autologous
stem cell rescue (or HDT/ASCR). First,
many of your healthy stem cells will be
removed and stored for later. Next, you’ll
receive high doses of chemotherapy to
destroy the cancer cells. Chemotherapy
will also wipe out the blood-producing
cells in the bone marrow. Your healthy
stem cells will then be returned to your
body to “rescue” your bone marrow.

CAR T-cell therapy may be a way to
accomplish the same results as an allogeneic
transplant but without some of the long-term
side effects. CAR T-cell therapy is a fairly
new treatment for MCL. So, more research is
needed to learn about its effectiveness and its
long-term side effects.

An allogeneic transplant uses
healthy stem cells from a donor. You’ll first
receive treatment, called conditioning, to
eliminate as much cancer as possible and
help prevent your body from rejecting the
transplanted cells. Next, you’ll receive the

MCL treatment options » Clinical trials

Clinical trials
Therapy may also be given as part of a
clinical trial. A clinical trial is a type of medical
research study. Clinical trials are a key way to
assess new treatment approaches. After being
developed and tested in a laboratory, potential
new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied
in people. If found to be safe and effective
in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment
approach may be approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Are clinical trials free?
There’s no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs indirectly related to the trial, such
as the cost of transportation or childcare due
to extra appointments and the costs of routine
patient care during the trial. Depending on the
trial, you may continue to receive standard
cancer care. The standard therapy is billed
to—and often covered by—insurance. You’re
responsible for copays and any costs for this
care that aren’t covered by your insurance.

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. This is
an agreement that confirms you’ve been fully
told about your part in the trial. Read the form
carefully and ask questions before signing it.
Take time to discuss it with family, friends, or
others you trust. Keep in mind that you can
leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical
trial at any time.

“

Start the conversation
Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about all
your treatment options. Ask if a clinical trial is
available for your situation. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment, you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

A common myth is that palliative
care is only for terminally ill
patients. They are so much
more! It is worth reaching out to
palliative care in your hospital
or clinic. They treat the whole
patient, not just cancer. ”

Frequently asked questions
There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.
Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in cancer clinical
trials. It’s common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You’ll be informed if a
placebo is part of a clinical trial before you
enroll.
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Mantle Cell Lymphoma, 2023

Supportive care
Supportive care (sometimes called palliative
care) is health care that relieves symptoms
caused by cancer or by its treatment.
Supportive care aims to improve your quality
of life.

26

MCL treatment options » Treatment side effects

Supportive care involves the whole person,
not just their cancer. If you’re having a problem
that’s interfering with your treatment or affecting
your quality of life, ask what supportive care
resources may be available to help you.

Supportive care is important at any stage
of cancer, not just at the end of life. In fact,
people who start supportive care when they
begin treatment tend to have improved
outcomes and better quality of life.
Supportive care addresses many needs:
relieving symptoms, preventing or lessening
treatment side effects, and providing emotional
or spiritual support, financial aid, or family
counseling. Supportive care can help with
making treatment decisions. It can also
assist with coordinating care between health
providers. Supportive care may be able to
arrange transportation to and from doctor’s
visits and help set up home care. Supportive
care can help answer your questions about
nutrition and diet.

Treatment side effects
All treatments can cause unwanted health
problems called side effects. Some side effects
may be harmful to your health. Others may just
be unpleasant.
Side effects differ between people. Side effects
can depend on the treatment type, length
or dose of treatment, and the person. Some
people have side effects while others have
none. Some people have mild side effects
while others have severe effects.

Speak to your care team about how you’re
feeling and if you’re having any side effects.
Some people with MCL develop chronic
infections or low blood cell counts. Treatments
are available to fight infections and strengthen
immunity. Ask about supportive care if you
have infections that keep coming back.

Most side effects appear shortly after
treatment starts. Most side effects go away in
days or weeks after treatment is over. Other
side effects may be long-term or appear years
later.

a list of possible side
effects right before each

Treatment decisions are based on factors
such as age, level of fitness, and overall
health. Often the most important factor is
the extent of the cancer—how much it has
grown.
The extent of cancer is represented by
cancer stage. A lower number means less
cancer in the body and a higher number
means more.
Stage 1 and stage 2 refer to the early
stages of MCL. These cancers are found
in only one or just a few areas near each
other in the body. MCL is rarely diagnosed
at these stages.
Stage 3 and stage 4 are advanced or
later stages of MCL. These cancers are
found in several locations around the
body. Almost all people with MCL are
diagnosed when the cancer has reached
these stages.
There are many types of treatment for
MCL. Not everyone with MCL receives
the same treatment.
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer
cells. Immunotherapy uses manufactured
antibodies to destroy cancer cells.
Chemoimmunotherapy is a more effective
combination of these two treatments.
Targeted therapy drugs attack certain
cancer cells to slow their growth.
An autologous stem cell transplant uses
high doses of chemotherapy followed
by stem cell “rescue.” An allogeneic
transplant replaces your stem cells

continue to evolve. This chapter
explains the treatment process.

Unfortunately, most cancer drugs begin
to lose their effect against the cancer
sooner or later. This is the main reason
why relapses occur. The cancer becomes
“resistant” to the drug. So, each time MCL
relapses, it may be more difficult to treat it
than the time before.

People who have stage 3 or stage 4 mantle
cell lymphoma are considered to have
advanced MCL. (For information about earlystage MCL, see Chapter 5.)
The goal of treating advanced MCL is to
remove as much lymphoma as possible and
keep the disease under control. Treatment
may continue for months or even years.
Treatment for advanced MCL depends on
whether the lymphoma is aggressive (fast
growing) or indolent (slow growing). Most
people who are diagnosed with advanced MCL
have the fast-growing type. For Treatment for
slow-growing MCL, see page 34.

you may want to try a third (third-line)
treatment option.

First-line treatment
Initial (first-line) treatment is given in three
phases: induction, consolidation, and
maintenance.

Treatment for fast-growing
MCL

Induction therapy
The goal of the induction phase is to reduce
the amount of cancer as much as possible.
The choice of induction treatment depends
on whether your body can handle aggressive
treatment. Preferred options for first-line
induction therapy are listed in Guide 2.
Another highly recommended treatment option
for people with advanced stage MCL is to join
a clinical trial.

Advanced, fast-growing MCL usually requires
more than one type of therapy. The first
therapy given is called initial treatment (also
called first-line treatment). If the lymphoma
comes back after initial treatment, your
treatment team will suggest another therapy
(second-line treatment).
If the lymphoma comes back after both the
initial treatment and the second-line treatment,

but you may be able to take a break from
treatment for a while.

After induction therapy, your treatment team
will evaluate your results to see how well the
therapy worked:

by first-line therapy, another “line”

available. See Chapter 6 for treatment
for Relapsed and refractory MCL.

Consolidation phase
The consolidation phase of first-line treatment
begins after achieving a complete response to
induction therapy. The goal of the consolidation
phase is to bolster the results of induction
therapy and to delay the lymphoma from
coming back.



If you didn’t have a complete response
to induction therapy, you may have
additional therapy first to try to achieve a
complete response before going ahead with
consolidation therapy. The preferred additional
therapy is targeted treatment with a BTK
inhibitor (Imbruvica, Calquence, or Brukinsa),
although chemoimmunotherapy may also be
an option.

Consolidation
(for some patients)
• High-dose chemotherapy with

Consolidation treatment typically involves highdose chemotherapy followed by an autologous
stem cell transplant. Not all patients with
MCL can go through this intense treatment.
Those who can’t may be better off with a
different option (like a clinical trial) or skipping
consolidation altogether.

Maintenance
• Rituxan for 2 to 3 years for most
patients

Maintenance phase
The goal of maintenance therapy is to prevent
or delay the lymphoma from coming back. Or,
if MCL is still present, maintenance therapy is
used to keep the lymphoma under control.

If you have a relapse or recurrence during
or after first-line therapy, you can try to join a
clinical trial. If you can’t find a suitable clinical
trial, you can have second-line treatment. For
information on second-line treatment, see
Chapter 6.

Maintenance therapy typically includes Rituxan
given by intravenous (IV) infusion every 8
weeks for up to 2 to 3 years. For people
who received aggressive induction therapy,
maintenance may also include Imbruvica oral
medicine daily (tablets, capsules, or liquid) or a
similar BTK inhibitor for 2 years.

Treatment for slow-growing
MCL
People with indolent MCL often have no
symptoms and no swollen glands when they’re
diagnosed. The lymphoma exists only in their
bone marrow and blood (although some may
have it in their spleen or gastrointestinal tract).

Follow-up care
During the maintenance phase, you’ll have
visits with your care team every 3 to 6 months.
You’ll also be tested for any signs that MCL
has returned (relapsed) and checked for any
side effects.

For people with indolent MCL that has no
symptoms, doctors often take a watch-and-

wait (observation) approach instead of starting
treatment immediately. MCL can be indolent
for months, or even years, before it needs to
be treated.
If MCL symptoms begin, you’ll need to be
re-evaluated. Your doctor will assess if the
lymphoma is now growing faster. It may be
biopsied again and tested for a genetic TP53
mutation. Most people with MCL don’t have a
TP53 mutation. If you develop MCL symptoms
or have other signs that the lymphoma is
growing, then you and your care team should
decide whether treatment should begin. For

Survivorship
Living with cancer is called survivorship.
It starts when your cancer is diagnosed.

discusses how early MCL can be
treated.

In some cases, treatment for stage 1 or
stage 2 MCL may not be needed right away.
Instead, a watch-and-wait approach (also
called observation) is used to decide when
to start treatment. People under observation
continue to have tests to keep an eye on their
lymphoma. They see their doctor every 2 or
3 months, or longer if the disease has been
stable for a while. If symptoms arise, they’ll
begin treatment.

The early stages of mantle cell lymphoma are
stage 1 and stage 2. Stage 1 MCL is defined
as cancer in one lymph node or in one group
of nearby lymph nodes. Stage 2 MCL has
affected two or more lymph nodes or groups of
nearby lymph nodes.
Because these lymphomas occur in fewer
areas in the body, people seldom show
significant symptoms. That’s one reason why
MCL is rarely diagnosed at these stages.

Follow-up care
After initial treatment, your care team will
evaluate your results to see how well the

The choice of additional therapy depends on

Complete response

Partial response
A partial response to induction therapy means
that the lymphoma has decreased in size but
is still there. If you have a partial response,
additional therapy may be recommended to
try to put the cancer into remission (complete
response).

In many people, mantle cell lymphoma often
improves with treatment, but then eventually
comes back (relapses). In other cases, firstline treatment may have no effect or the
lymphoma may even get worse–this is called
refractory disease. It means the cancer didn’t
respond to therapy.

Preferred options
In recent years, clinical trials have shown that
targeted therapy with one of the BTK inhibitors
can be more effective than other therapies
for relapsed or refractory MCL. So, one of the
BTK inhibitors is commonly chosen for secondline treatment. Preferred options include
either Brukinsa (zanubrutinib) or Calquence
(acalabrutinib). If you’ve been prescribed a

Supportive care

overall health, and which treatments you’ve
already had.

The main concern for most people with cancer
is to find treatment that works. Having cancer
is about more than treatment, though. Cancer
care is a rollercoaster that includes many
additional physical and emotional challenges.
It’s important to know that you can get support
for these challenges.

For example, if your second-line treatment was
immunotherapy with Revlimid and Rituxan,
your next treatment may be a BTK inhibitor. Or,
if you tried a BTK inhibitor as your second-line
treatment but it’s losing its effect, you might
begin Jaypirca. Jaypirca is also a BTK inhibitor
but it works in a slightly different way than
other BTK inhibitors.

Supportive care is for relieving the symptoms
of cancer and the side effects of cancer
treatment. It’s also for other issues related to
cancer.

Another option: NCCN experts strongly
encourage people with relapsed or refractory
MCL to join a clinical trial.

For people with relapsed or refractory MCL,
an important type of supportive care may be
radiation therapy to relieve pain. Low-dose
radiation therapy is not given to cure the
lymphoma but can alleviate symptoms such
as bone pain. For other types of pain, you may
receive medicine or other treatment.

These and other options for additional therapy
are listed in Guide 5.
Read more about side effects of CAR
T-cell therapy in NCCN Guidelines for
Patients: Immunotherapy Side Effects: CAR
T-Cell Therapy, available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient
Guides for Cancer app.

There’s also treatment available for mouth
sores and swelling (oral mucositis), which is a
side effect of some cancer therapies.

Follow-up care

Supportive care can also help with
psychological, social, and spiritual issues. Ask
your care team what supportive care resources
are available to help you.

After treatment, you’ll need to see your care
team frequently so they can check how you’re
doing. You’ll likely have follow-up visits every
3 to 6 months or as often as your care team
recommends.

Living with cancer is called survivorship. It
starts when your cancer is diagnosed. Read
more about survivorship in NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Survivorship Care for CancerRelated Late and Long-Term Effects, available
at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the
NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Follow-up tests often include in-person checkups to evaluate how you feel, as well as
evaluations such as a physical exam, blood
tests, and imaging tests (CT scans). The
follow-up plan is adapted for each person and
can be adjusted for someone who’s in a long
remission (for example, visits less often).

Relapsed and refractory MCL » Advance care planning

Advance care planning
When cancer is diagnosed very late or keeps
progressing despite all treatment efforts, it
may be time to consider what lies ahead. This
exploration of what’s important to you is called
advance care planning.
Advance care planning is for everyone,
not just for those who are very sick. Even
when cancers are curable, talking about
future scenarios should begin when starting
treatment.

It’s important to
ask for help
Depression, anxiety, fear, and distress
are very common feelings for people
with cancer. These feelings can make it
harder to deal with cancer and cancer
treatment. They can hold you back
even when you want to move forward.
Getting help when you’re feeling
worried or hopeless is an important part
of cancer care. If you’re feeling anxious
or overwhelmed, ask your treatment
team for help.

Advance care planning means deciding what
care you would want if you become unable to
make medical decisions for yourself. It’s about
making sure that your wishes are understood
and respected. The focus is on you receiving
the best possible care at the end of your
life. People with incurable cancer can set up
an advance care plan early on to feel less
stressed and better able to cope with their
condition.
You can decide if there is a point where you
might want to stop cancer treatment. You can
also decide what treatments you would want
for symptom relief.

More information about cancer and
distress is available at NCCN.org/
patientguidelines and on the NCCN
Patient Guides for Cancer app.

Once you’ve made these decisions, you’ll fill
out a legal document that explains what you
want to be done if you aren’t able to tell your
care team yourself. This document is called
an advance directive. Doctors are required to
follow the instructions in an advance directive
when you’re too ill to make decisions about
your care.

loved ones disagree with your plan, speak
to your care team. Sometimes they or other
specialists can help you and your family
navigate these difficult conversations.

Tell your care team and family about your
advance directive and its contents. Give a
copy of your advance directive to all your
doctors. Make sure you give a copy to anyone
you’ve authorized to make decisions on your
behalf (health care proxy). If your family or
NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
