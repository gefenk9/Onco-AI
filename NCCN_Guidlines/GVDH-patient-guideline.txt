GVHD basics

Blood

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is
a complication that may occur after
a donor stem cell or bone marrow
transplant. GVHD occurs when the
donor cells mistakenly attack your body.
Symptoms can be mild or severe.

Blood has many functions; they include:

Blood
Blood is made up of red blood cells, white
blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Plasma is
the largest part of your blood. Plasma is made
up of mostly water. Blood cells float in plasma.
Blood takes oxygen and nutrients to your
body’s tissues, and carries away waste.
There are 3 types of blood cells:


Red blood cells (RBCs)



White blood cells (WBCs)



Platelets (PLTs)

Transportation – Blood takes oxygen
from the lungs to the rest of the body. It
takes carbon dioxide, a waste product,
from the body’s cells to the lungs where
it is breathed out. Blood also carries
nutrients, hormones, and other waste
products around the body.



Regulation – Blood helps to keep the
acid-base balance of the body in check.
It also plays a part in regulating body
temperature. Increasing the amount of
blood flowing close to the skin helps the
body to lose heat.



Protection – White blood cells attack and
destroy invading germs (such as viruses
and bacteria). Blood clots form after an
injury, which protects the body from losing
too much blood.

How blood cells are formed

Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue in
the center of most bones. Inside your bone
marrow are early blood-forming cells called
blood stem cells (hematopoietic stem cells). All
types of blood cells start as blood stem cells.
Once blood cells mature, they are released
in your bloodstream. Normal stem cells grow
and divide to make new red blood cells, white
blood cells, and platelets.

Blood cells do not live forever. Most normal
red blood cells live for 120 days. Normal
white blood cells live for 8 to 14 days. Normal
platelets live for about a week (7 days). After
cells reach these ages, they die off and are
replaced by new cells. Your blood cells are
being replaced in your body all the time.

GVHD basics

Stem cell transplant

Stem cell transplant

After conditioning, you will receive the healthy
stem cells through a transfusion. A transfusion
is a slow injection of blood products into a vein.
This can take several hours. The transplanted
stem cells will travel to your bone marrow and
grow. New, healthy blood cells will form. This is
called engraftment. It usually occurs about 2 to
4 weeks after the transplant.

A stem cell transplant (SCT) destroys cells in
the bone marrow and replaces them with new,
healthy blood-forming cells. These healthy
stem cells form new marrow and blood cells.
An SCT may also be called a hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT) or bone marrow
transplant (BMT).

Until the new, healthy blood cells form,
you will have little or no immune defense.
You may need to stay in a very clean room
at the hospital or be given antibiotics to
prevent or treat infection. You may receive
immunosuppressants to prevent graft-versushost disease (GVHD). While waiting for the
cells to engraft, you will likely feel tired and
weak.

Before an SCT, you will receive a procedure
called conditioning. Conditioning uses
chemotherapy (and/or radiation therapy) to
destroy bone marrow cells. This procedure
creates room for the healthy stem cells, and
weakens the immune system so your body
does not kill the transplanted cells.

Blood stem cells
Bone marrow
contains stem cells.
A blood stem cell is
an immature cell that
can develop into a
red blood cell, a white
blood cell, or a platelet.

GVHD basics

GVHD

GVHD
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a
complication that occurs in those who have an
allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). An
alloSCT replaces stem cells with those of a
donor that may or may not be related to you.

GVHD affects
everyone differently.
Contact your care
team about anything
unusual so it can be
treated right away.

In GVHD, donor blood stem cells see your
normal, healthy tissues as foreign and attack
them. Any area of the body can be affected.
The most common areas affected include the
skin, liver, and digestive tract. Other areas of
the body may also be involved, such as the
lungs, eyes, mouth, hair, nails, joints, muscles,
kidneys, and genitals. Symptoms can be mild
or severe and life-threatening.

Each type of GVHD has a different effect
on organs and tissues. Although acute and
chronic GVHD usually occur during different
time periods after transplant, it is possible to
have both at the same time called overlap
chronic GVHD.

GVHD disease can occur within the first
few months after SCT (acute) or much
later (chronic). Treatment aims to manage
symptoms and to prevent further damage to
your body.
There are 2 types of GHVD:




Many organs are affected by GVHD; they
include:

Acute GVHD (aGVHD) - Typically
develops within 3 months after
transplant. It can also occur when
immunosuppressants are stopped.
Acute GVHD primarily affects the skin,
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and liver.
Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) - Typically
develops within 1 year after transplant.
Chronic GVHD may involve the eyes,
mouth, skin, joints, GI tract, lungs, and
other organs.

GVHD basics

Risk factors

Risk factors
A risk factor is anything that increases your
chance of getting a disease. Having one or
more risk factors does not mean you will
get the disease.

HLA typing
Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are
proteins found on the surface of most cells.
They play an important role in your body’s
immune response.

Risk factors for GVHD include:




Mismatched or not fully matched
donor – donor is not a perfect match
to your human leukocyte antigens
(HLAs). Any difference can cause
donor cells to attack your tissues and
organs.

HLAs are unique to each person. They
mark your body’s cells. Your body detects
these markers to tell which cells are yours.
Each person’s set of HLAs is called the
HLA type or tissue type.

Unrelated donor – risk increases if
the donor is not related to you, even if
they are a perfect match.



Age (donor or recipient) – risk
increases with age.



Previously having acute GVHD
(aGVHD) - increases the risk of
recurrent acute or chronic GVHD.

HLA typing is a blood test that detects
a person’s HLA type. This test is done
before a donor (allogeneic) blood stem
cell transplant. To find a donor match, your
proteins will be compared to the donor’s
proteins to see how many proteins are the
same.

Lower your risk

There are things you can do to lower your
risk for GVHD; they include:



Take your prescribed medicines – It is
important that you continue taking them
even if you feel better.



Be alert for warning signs – Tell your
doctor about any changes to your body.
Your transplant team will give you a list of
signs and symptoms for GVHD.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Graft-Versus-Host Disease, 2021

Share information with your care
team – Other types of providers (such
as primary care providers) may not be as
familiar with GVHD. It is ok to ask your
doctors to speak to each other.

Testing

Test results

Treatment planning starts with testing.
Accurate testing is needed to diagnose
and treat GVHD. This chapter presents
an overview of the tests you might
receive and what to expect.

Test results

Create a medical binder

GVHD may be diagnosed based on blood
tests, a skin exam, physical exam, biopsy,
stool sample, and possible imaging studies.
Your diagnosis will determine your treatment
plan. It is important you understand what these
tests mean.

A medical binder or notebook is a great
way to organize all of your records in one
place.
•

Make copies of blood tests, imaging
results, and reports about your specific
type of cancer. It will be helpful when
getting a second opinion.

•

Choose a binder that meets your
needs. Consider a zipper pocket to
include a pen, small calendar, and
insurance cards.

•

Create folders for insurance forms,
medical records, and tests results. You
can do the same on your computer.

Keep these things in mind:


Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if
possible.



Write down questions and take notes
during appointments. Don’t be afraid to
ask your care team questions. Get to
know your care team and help them get
to know you.



Get copies of blood tests, imaging results,
and reports.

•



Organize your papers. Create files for
insurance forms, medical records, and
test results. You can do the same on your
computer.

Use online patient portals to view
your test results and other records.
Download or print the records to add to
your binder.

•

Organize your binder in a way that
works for you. Add a section for
questions and to take notes.

•

Bring your medical binder to
appointments. You never know when
you might need it!



Keep a list of contact information for
everyone on your care team. Add it
to your phone. Hang the list on your
refrigerator or keep it in a place where
someone can access it in an emergency.
Keep your primary care physician
informed of changes to this list.

Testing

General health tests | Blood tests

General health tests



Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your
neck, underarm, and groin. Tell your
doctor if you have felt any lumps or have
any pain.



Conduct a complete skin exam.

Medical history

A medical history is a record of all health
issues and treatments you have had in your
life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury
and when it happened. Bring a list of old and
new medicines and any over-the-counter
medicines, herbals, or supplements you take.
Tell your doctor about any symptoms you
have. A medical history will help determine
which treatment is best for you. It is sometimes
called a health history.

Blood tests
Blood tests check for signs of disease and
how well organs are working. They require
a sample of your blood, which is removed
through a needle placed into your vein.

Family history

Some cancers and other diseases can run
in families. Your doctor will ask about the
health history of your family members who
are blood relatives. This information is called
a family history. Ask family members about
their health issues like heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes, and at what age they were
diagnosed.

Complete blood count

Physical exam

A basic metabolic panel checks kidney function
and electrolytes (salts) in the blood. Kidney
function and electrolytes can be affected if you
are dehydrated from having diarrhea or can be
affected by side effects from medicine.

A complete blood count (CBC) measures the
levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your
blood. Your doctor will want to know if you
have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen
throughout your body, white blood cells to fight
infection, and platelets to control bleeding.

During a physical exam, a health care provider
may:


Check your temperature, blood pressure,
pulse, and breathing rate



Check your weight. Weight loss may be a
sign of GVHD.



Listen to your lungs and heart



Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat



Feel and apply pressure to parts of your
body to see if organs are of normal size,
are soft or hard, or cause pain when
touched. Tell your doctor if you feel pain.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Graft-Versus-Host Disease, 2021

Liver function tests

Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health
of your liver by measuring chemicals that are
made or processed by the liver. Levels that
are too high or low signal that the liver is not
working well and can be a sign of GVHD.

14

2

Testing

Skin exam

Skin exam

One LFT measured is bilirubin, a chemical that
gives bile its greenish color. There may be too
much bilirubin in the blood if the liver is not
working as well as it should. Too much bilirubin
causes a yellowing of the eyes and skin called
jaundice. It might cause itchy skin and darkcolored urine. Elevated bilirubin levels can be
a sign of GVHD.

It is important to find an experienced health
care provider to conduct a thorough skin exam.
Expect a head-to-toe skin exam that includes
review of the scalp, face, mouth, hands, feet,
torso and extremities, eyes and eyelids, ears,
fingers, toes, and toenails. Skin conditions
such as rashes, lesions (bumps), and dry or
peeling skin are common in GVHD.

Hepatitis panel

Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver.
Sometimes, this inflammation is caused by
viruses such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B (HBV),
and hepatitis C (HCV). Hepatitis causes the
liver to not work as it should.

A skin lesion is a change in color or texture.
In GVHD, these areas are measured using
the size of your hand. One hand is equal to 1
percent (1%) of your total body surface area
(BSA). Keeping a photo journal might help
track your skin changes.

A hepatitis panel will tell your treatment
team if you had hepatitis in the past or if you
have it today. Certain treatments such as
immunosuppressive therapies can reactivate
HBV in the blood.

Skin lesions
A papule is a very small, solid
bump. A plaque is a raised or
hardened lesion that forms on
the skin, larger than a papule.

Testing

Stool sample
Ulcer

Some words to describe skin lesions might
include patch, papule, plaque, nodule, and
erythroderma.

A skin ulcer is an open sore or wound on the
skin caused by poor blood flow. Ulcers caused
by GVHD can also be found on the genitals or
in the mouth.

Erythroderma

Erythroderma is redness of over 80 percent
(80%) of the body’s skin surface. Erythroderma
can look like a sunburn or large blotches on
the skin.

Stool sample
Stool, also called feces or poop, is made up
of undigested food, bacteria, mucus, and cells
from the lining of the intestines. Since GVHD
might affect the digestive tract, symptoms such
as diarrhea or abdominal pain are concerning
for GVHD. Infection in the bowels can also
cause similar symptoms. Therefore, it is
important to test for infections if you are having
diarrhea and GVHD is suspected. A stool
sample will be checked for different infections.

Papule

A papule is a very small, solid lump that might
look like a very small pimple. Papules are
usually found in groups. They may be red,
purple, brown, or pink.

Papulonodular

Papulonodular is a combination of papules and
nodules found on the skin. Nodules are more
raised than papules.

For this test, you will need to provide a sample
of your poop. You will be given a special
container with a lid to take home. Speak with
your doctor about how you should collect the
stool sample and any special instructions.

Patch

A patch is a flat, thin, pink or red lesion of
any size that forms on the skin. Patches
may be dry, scaly, or itchy, and may look like
eczema or psoriasis. They can be lighter
than surrounding skin or brown in people with
darker skin. The patches may sometimes
become plaques (hard, raised lesions) on the
skin.

Plaque

A plaque is a raised (elevated) or hardened
(indurated) lesion of any size that forms on the
skin. Plaques may be red, scaly, or itchy, and
may look like eczema or psoriasis.

Testing

Biopsy

Biopsy
A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue
or group of cells for testing. It is an important
part of an accurate diagnosis. Your sample
should be reviewed by a pathologist who is an
expert in the diagnosis of GVHD. This review
is often referred to as histology, histopathology,
or hematopathology review. The pathologist
will note the overall appearance and the size,
shape, and type of your cells. Tests will be
done on the biopsied cells.

Testing takes time.
It might take days
or weeks for all test
results to come in.

Biopsies of the skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
liver, or other organs might be done to confirm
GVHD.

GI biopsy

Skin biopsy

A GI biopsy is often performed to confirm
a diagnosis of GI acute GVHD. A biopsy
might be done during an endoscopy (EGD),
colonoscopy, and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy.

If you have skin lesions, a sample of your
lesion may be removed and tested to plan
treatment.

In an EGD, a device is guided down the throat
into the esophagus, stomach, and upper parts
of the small intestine (duodenum). An EGD
is used to inspect the lining of these organs
and to look for any signs of cancer or other
abnormalities such as dilated blood vessels or
ulcers. An EGD can also be referred to as an
upper GI endoscopy or duodenoscopy.

Liver biopsy

In a liver biopsy, a needle may be inserted
through your skin to remove a liver sample. It
also may be inserted through a large vein in
your neck (jugular), and threaded down to a
vein (inferior vena cava) near your liver.

In a colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy,
a device is inserted into the rectum to inspect
the colon.

Testing

Imaging

Imaging

MRI scan

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses radio waves and powerful magnets to
take pictures of the inside of the body. It does
not use x-rays. Contrast might be used.

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside
of your body. A radiologist, an expert in
interpreting test images, will write a report
and send this report to your doctor. Your test
results will be discussed with you.

Ultrasound

An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound
waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. A probe will be pressed onto your
abdomen. This is similar to the sonogram used
for pregnancy. Ultrasound is painless and
does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as
needed. Sometimes, an ultrasound or CT is
used to guide a biopsy.

CT scan

A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan
uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many
x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make
one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture.
In most cases, contrast will be used. Contrast
material is used to improve the pictures of the
inside of the body. Contrast materials are not
dyes, but substances that help enhance and
improve the images of several organs and
structures in the body. It is used to make the
pictures clearer. Contrast might be taken by
mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV). The
contrast is not permanent and will leave the
body in your urine immediately after the test.

X-ray

An x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one
picture at a time of the inside of the body. A
chest x-ray is used to check for infection in your
lungs.

Tell your doctors if you have had allergic
reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines,
such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and
prednisone (a steroid), to avoid the effects of
those allergies. Contrast might not be used if
you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys
aren’t working well.

Performance status

Performance status

PS might be referred to as good or poor. Good
PS is usually PS 0 or PS 1.

Performance status (PS) is a person’s general
level of fitness and ability to perform daily
tasks. Your state of general health will be rated
using a PS scale called the ECOG (Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group) or the Karnofsky
Performance Scale (KPS).

Karnofsky PS

The KPS score ranges from 0 to 100.

ECOG PS



10 to 40 means you cannot care for
yourself.



50 to 70 means you cannot work and
need some help to take care of yourself.



80 to 100 means you can carry out daily
tasks.

The ECOG PS scores range from 0 to 4.


PS 0 means you are fully active.



PS 1 means you are still able to perform
light to moderate activity.



PS 2 means you can still care for yourself
but are not active.



PS 3 means you are limited to a chair or
bed more than half of the time.



PS 4 means you need someone to care
for you and are limited to a chair or bed.

Treatment

Skin-directed therapy

Skin-directed therapy

Your physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing play an important role in your recovery
from GVHD. You know your body better
than anyone. Help other team members
understand:


How you feel



What you need



What is working and what is not

Types of therapy focused on the skin include
topical therapy and phototherapy.

Topical therapy

Topical treatments are put on the surface of
the skin. They might be a lotion, cream, gel, or
ointment.
Topical steroids used to treat GVHD include:

Keep a list of names and contact information
for each member of your team. This will make
it easier for you and anyone involved in your
care to know whom to contact with questions
or concerns.



Clobetasol propionate



Hydrocortisone



Triamcinolone acetonide (Triderm™)

Tacrolimus (Protopic®) is an ointment form of
the immunosuppressant drug tacrolimus.

Phototherapy

Phototherapy uses ultraviolet (UV) light
wavelengths to treat skin lesions in GVHD.
Photochemotherapy ultraviolet light A (or
PUVA) combines psoralen (P) with UVA.
Psoralen is a type of medicine taken by mouth
(orally) that causes your skin to be sensitive to
light. After taking psoralen, the skin is exposed
to long-wave UV light. PUVA might be given to
treat severe skin-only GVHD.

Get to know your
care team and help
them get to
know you.

UV can increase your risk of some skin
cancers. Phototherapy may not be favored
in those with a history of squamoproliferative
skin neoplasms, basal cell carcinomas, or who
have had melanoma.

Treatment

Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy

Antibiotics

Opportunistic infections (OIs) are infections
that occur more frequently and are more
severe in those with a weakened immune
system. A stem cell transplant (SCT) weakens
the body’s natural defense against infections.
If not treated early, infections can be fatal.
Infections can be caused by viruses, fungus,
or bacteria. Antibiotics can treat bacterial
infections. Antifungal medicines can treat
fungal infections. You may be given antiviral
drugs to prevent viral infections.

Systemic therapy is treatment that affects
the whole body. It is usually given by mouth
(oral) or through a needle inserted into a vein
(intravenously or IV).
Types of systemic therapy used to treat GVHD
include:


Antibiotics



Antihistamines



Biologics



Chemotherapy



Immunosuppressants



Steroids



Targeted therapy

Azithromycin (Zithromax®) is an antibiotic that
might be used to treat lung issues in chronic
GVHD.

Antihistamines

Antihistamines are a type of drug that blocks
the action of histamines, which can cause
fever, itching, sneezing, a runny nose, and
watery eyes. Antihistamines can control itchy
skin, watery eyes, and other symptoms of
GVHD.

A biosimilar might be used in place of some
drugs. A biosimilar is a drug that is very much
like one that has been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It must
be used in the exact same way and at the
same dose as the other drug.

AAT

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein that
protects the lungs and liver from damage. It
may be used for GVHD.

Ask your doctor about the goal of systemic
therapy and why one therapy might be chosen
over another. The reason might be related to
your symptoms, cost, toxicity, or availability.
Your wishes are also important.

Biologics

A biologic is made from a living organism or its
products. Etanercept (Enbrel®) and infliximab
(Remicade®) are biologics that stop or slow
inflammation. Other examples of biologics
used for GVHD include ATG, basiliximab
(Simulect), tocilizumab (Actemra®), and
rituximab (Rituxan®).

Systemic therapies can fall into more than one
category. The types described on the following
pages provide a general overview. Not all
possible drugs are listed.

Treatment

Chemotherapy | Immunosuppressants

Chemotherapy
Steroids may cause
dizziness, headache,
trouble sleeping,
depression, or mood
swings, among many
other effects. Speak
to your doctor about
potential side effects.

Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells
throughout the body, including cancer cells and
normal cells. Methotrexate stops the cells from
dividing and making new cells. Methotrexate is
used to prevent GVHD following bone marrow
or SCT. Since this medicine may cause
mouth sores, good oral care is very important.
Melphalan (Alkeran®) is an example of a
chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®)
is a chemotherapy that may be used for GVHD
prevention.

Immunosuppressants

Calcineurin inhibitors

A calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) is used for
prevention and treatment of GVHD. Types
include cyclosporine, tacrolimus ointment
(Protopic®), tacrolimus (Prograf®), and
pimecrolimus (topical only). They can be used
as a pill, intravenously (IV), or as an ointment.

Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) uses
materials made either by the body or in a
laboratory to improve, target, or restore
immune system function. IST is a type of
drug therapy that lowers the body’s immune
response to prevent the donor immune
cells from attacking your healthy tissues.
Immunosuppressants can be topical or
systemic.

Steroids

Corticosteroids or steroids are lab-made
immunosuppressants used to reduce
inflammation in many conditions. In GVHD,
they are used to stop activated donor immune
cells from harming your body. Steroids can
be placed on the skin as an ointment or gel,
inhaled through the mouth, used as a mouth
(oral) rinse, taken as a pill, or given as an
infusion through an IV needle. They each work
differently to treat side effects of GVHD.

Some ISTs used to treat GVHD include:


Calcineurin inhibitors (such as
cyclosporine and tacrolimus)



Cyclosporine (Neoral®)



Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)



Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®)



Sirolimus (Rapamune®)



Steroids

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Graft-Versus-Host Disease, 2021

Steroids can cause short-term and longterm side effects. Ask your care team about
possible side effects.

25

3

Treatment

Targeted therapy
Prednisone

Usually, steroids are used as a first-line
treatment for both acute and chronic GVHD.

Prednisone helps treat and prevent GVHD by
weakening your new, transplanted immune
system. This gives the new immune system
more time to get used to and tolerate your
body. The goal is for your new immune system
to accept your body, not attack it. You might
be on prednisone for a long period of time,
depending on the severity of the GVHD. Longterm use can cause side effects.

Steroids taken by mouth as a pill or liquid:


Prednisone



Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol®)



Beclomethasone dipropionate



Budesonide (Entocort® EC, Ortikos,
Uceris)

Extracorporeal photopheresis

Steroids given via IV needle:


Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a type
of immunotherapy used to treat GVHD. In this
procedure, your blood is circulated outside the
body through a filter. This filter separates the
white blood cells from the rest of your blood.
The white blood cells are combined with a
light-sensitive agent (8-methoxypsoralen) and
exposed to ultraviolet A (UVA) light to activate
the medicine, which kills the immune cells.
Then, the treated cells are reinfused back into
your body.

Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol®)

Steroids inhaled through the mouth:


Budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler™,
Pulmicort Respules®)



Fluticasone (Flovent HFA, Flovent Diskus)
for lung involvement

Steroid creams:


Hydrocortisone cream or ointment (1% or
2.5%)

Targeted therapy



Triamcinolone cream or ointment

Targeted therapy works throughout the
body. It is drug therapy that focuses on
specific or unique features of cells. Ibrutinib
(Imbruvica™), ruxolitinib (Jakafi®), and
belumosudil (Rezurock™) are targeted
therapies. Jakafi is used in both acute
and chronic GVHD that did not have good
response to steroids. Imbruvica and rezurock
are used in both acute and chronic GVHD.

Steroids given as an oral rinse (swish and
spit):

Clinical trials

Clinical trials

Who can enroll?

Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called
eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age,
transplant type, GVHD treatment history, or
general health. These requirements ensure
that participants are alike in specific ways
and that the trial is as safe as possible for the
participants.

A clinical trial is a type of medical research
study. After being developed and tested in
a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting
cancer need to be studied in people. If found
to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a
drug, device, or treatment approach may
be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

Informed consent

Clinical trials are managed by a group of
experts called a research team. The research
team will review the study with you in detail,
including its purpose and the risks and
benefits of joining. All of this information is also
provided in an informed consent form. Read
the form carefully and ask questions before
signing it. Take time to discuss with family,
friends, or others whom you trust. Keep in
mind that you can leave and seek treatment
outside of the clinical trial at any time.

New treatments of GVHD are being studied in
clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether
a clinical trial may make sense for you.

Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment.
Treatment trials are done in phases.


Phase I trials study the dose, safety, and
side effects of an investigational drug or
treatment approach. They also look for
early signs that the drug or approach is
helpful.



Phase II trials study how well the drug or
approach works against a specific type of
cancer.



Phase III trials test the drug or approach
against a standard treatment. If the
results are good, it may be approved by
the FDA.



Phase IV trials study the long-term
safety and benefit of an FDA-approved
treatment.

NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Graft-Versus-Host Disease, 2021

Start the conversation

Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical
trials. Start the conversation and learn about
all of your treatment options. If you find a study
that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment
team if you meet the requirements. If you have
already started standard treatment you may
not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try
not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New
clinical trials are always becoming available.

Clinical trials

Frequently asked questions

There are many myths and misconceptions
surrounding clinical trials. The possible
benefits and risks are not well understood by
many with cancer.

Will I get a placebo?
Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines)
are almost never used alone in GVHD clinical
trials. It is common to receive either a placebo
with a standard treatment, or a new drug with
a standard treatment. You will be informed,
verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a
clinical trial before you enroll.

Finding a clinical trial
In the United States
NCCN Cancer Centers
NCCN.org/cancercenters

Are clinical trials free?
There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The
study sponsor pays for research-related costs,
including the study drug. You may, however,
have costs that are indirectly related to the
trial, such as the cost of transportation or
child care due to extra appointments. During
the trial, you will continue to receive standard
cancer care. This care is billed to—and often
covered by—insurance. You are responsible
for copays and any costs for this care that are
not covered by your insurance.

Treatment

General supportive care

General supportive care

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping problems
are common in those with GVHD. Talk to your
doctor and with those whom you feel most
comfortable about how you are feeling. There
are services and people who can help you.
Support and counseling services are available.

Before your stem cell transplant (SCT), you
likely had many rounds of systemic therapy
and possibly radiation therapy to treat your
cancer. This weakened your body. An SCT
further weakens your body. You may also have
other serious health issues like high blood
pressure or diabetes that may complicate
recovery.

For more information, see NCCN Guidelines
for Patients: Distress During Cancer Care,
available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines.

It is critically important to take care of
yourself by eating well, drinking plenty of
fluids, exercising, and doing things that
make you feel energized. Strength is
needed to sustain you while being treated
for GVHD.

Disability and GVHD

Supportive care is health care that relieves
symptoms caused by GVHD and improves
quality of life. It might include pain relief
(palliative care), emotional or spiritual
support, financial aid, or family counseling.
Tell your care team how you are feeling
and about any side effects.

A disability is a condition that interferes
with or limits your ability to do daily tasks
like bathe, cook, think, work, or enjoy time
with others. It might affect your quality of
life. Many people with GVHD have some
type of disability. There are resources and
support available for those with shortterm and long-term disability as a result of
GVHD.

Diarrhea

Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel
movements. Your care team will tell
you how to manage diarrhea and may
recommend medicines to stop the diarrhea.
It is important to drink lots of fluids.
Changes to your diet might help.

Your physical, mental, and emotional
well-being play an important role in your
recovery from GVHD. You may want
to speak with a nurse navigator, social
worker, or someone at your local library
for more information on state or federal
disability benefits and how to access the
forms.

Distress

Distress is an unpleasant experience of a
mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature.
It can affect how you feel, think, and act.
Distress might include feelings of sadness,
fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt.

General supportive care

Fatigue

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and the inability
to function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may
be a sign of GVHD. There are treatments for
fatigue. Let your care team know how you are
feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of
doing the things you enjoy. Eating a balanced
diet, exercise, yoga, and massage therapy can
help. You might be referred to a nutritionist or
dietitian to help with fatigue.

Keep a pain diary
A pain diary is a written record that helps
you keep track of when you have pain, how
bad it is, what causes it, and what makes
it better or worse. Use a pain diary to
discuss your pain with your care team. You
might be referred to a specialist for pain
management.

Nausea and vomiting

Nausea and vomiting might be a sign of
GVHD. You will be given medicine to treat
nausea and vomiting.

Include in your pain diary:
•

The time and dose of all medicines

Trouble eating

•

When pain starts and ends or lessens

Sometimes side effects from GVHD might
cause you to feel not hungry or sick to your
stomach (nauseated). You might have a sore
mouth. Healthy eating is important during
treatment. It includes eating a balanced diet,
eating the right amount of food, and drinking
enough fluids. A registered dietitian who is an
expert in nutrition and food can help. Speak
to your care team if you have trouble eating or
maintaining your weight.

•

Where you feel pain

•

Describe your pain. Is it throbbing,
sharp, tingling, shooting, or burning? Is
it constant, or does it come and go?

•

Does the pain change at different times
of day? When?

•

Does the pain get worse before or after
meals? Does certain food or drink make
it better?

Pain

•

Does the pain get better or worse with
activity? What kind of activity?

•

Does the pain keep you from falling
asleep at night? Does pain wake you
up in the night?

•

Rate your pain from 0 (no pain) to 10
(worst pain you have ever felt)

•

Does pain get in the way of you doing
the things you enjoy?

Pain is common in GVHD. It might be caused
be nausea and vomiting or abdominal
cramps from diarrhea. Other sources of
pain can be the eyes, joints and muscles
(musculoskeletal), or mouth. Tell your care
team about any pain or discomfort you have.
You might meet with a palliative care specialist
or pain specialist to manage your pain.

Acute GVHD

Diagnosis | Stage

Stage

Acute graft-versus-host disease
(aGVHD) is a complication from a donor
stem cell transplant. It typically develops
soon after a transplant. Treatment aims
to suppress the immune response and
manage symptoms.

After diagnosis, your GVHD will be given a
stage. A stage is used to identify the extent of
the disease at the time of diagnosis. The stage
will be used to make treatment decisions.
In acute GVHD, each organ is staged
individually. The skin is given a stage based
on the amount of body surface area (BSA)
involved. The GI tract is given a stage based
on the amount of diarrhea or number of bowel
movements per day. And, the liver is given an
individual organ stage based on the rise in
your bilirubin level.

Diagnosis
In acute GVHD (aGVHD), the donor cells
attack areas of your body such as the skin,
liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. You might
have a skin rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,
and liver function issues. Tests will be done
to rule out non-GVHD causes. Biopsies of the
skin, GI tract, liver, or other organs might be
done to confirm GVHD.

Erythroderma
Erythroderma is severe
inflammation of most of the
body’s skin surface. It can look
like sunburn or large splotches.

Chronic GVHD

Diagnosis

Chronic graft-versus-host disease
(cGVHD) is a complication from a
donor stem cell transplant. It typically
develops within 1 year of the transplant.
Treatment aims to control symptoms,
avoid organ damage, and improve
quality of life.

Grade

A grade is a rating or score given to specific
signs or symptoms of GVHD. Grading is
based on your performance status (PS) and
the area(s) of the body affected. A score of
zero (0) means there are no symptoms or
signs. Severe symptoms or signs are given the
highest score of 3.

Diagnosis
Oral health care

Before starting treatment, a diagnosis of
chronic GVHD will be confirmed and a disease
grade will be given. While a biopsy may be
done to confirm chronic GVHD, a biopsy is not
always possible or necessary.

Chronic GVHD can cause problems in your
mouth. Symptoms often include sensitivity
and pain, dry mouth, changes in taste, and
difficulty opening your mouth. Seek care by
a dental professional if symptoms persist
or worsen.

Areas of the body that might be affected by
cGVHD:


Skin



Nails



Scalp and body hair



Mouth

•

Dental check-ups every 6 months.



Eyes

•



There are steps you can take to prevent
symptoms, including:

Chronic GVHD

Treatment

Treatment
Treatment for chronic GVHD aims to control
symptoms, avoid organ damage, and improve
quality of life. Since long-term steroid use
causes health issues and risk for infection,
you will be tapered off steroids when possible.
Some people may remain on low-dose steroids.

Those with steroidrefractory GVHD
are encouraged
to participate in
a clinical trial, if
available.

Treatment is based on symptoms. Options
may include one or more of the following:


Clinical trial



Continue or restart original
immunosuppressive therapy



Systemic corticosteroids
(methylprednisolone or prednisone)



Topical steroids as needed (such as
triamcinolone or clobetasol), topical
estrogen for vulvovaginal GVHD, topical
tacrolimus, or dexamethasone mouth
rinse for oral GVHD



Inhaled steroid (examples include
budesonide or fluticasone)



Azithromycin for lung involvement (those
with progression or worsening of lung
cGVHD following 2 to 3 lines of therapy
may be evaluated for lung transplant)

If cGVHD does not respond to treatment,
then you will be treated for steroid-refractory
disease.

Chronic GVHD

Steroid-refractory disease

Steroid-refractory disease

Guide 2
SR-cGVHD systemic therapy

Steroid-refractory disease happens in about
1 out of every 2 people with chronic GVHD.
Steroid-refractory chronic GVHD (SR-cGVHD)
is very serious and can be life-threatening.
Participation in a clinical trial is encouraged, if
available.

Ruxolitinib
Abatacept
Alemtuzumab

In SR-cGVHD, GVHD stops responding to
or worsens on steroid treatment. To get your
disease under control, another systemic
therapy is added to the steroid treatment.
Often, your original immunosuppressant is
combined with a systemic therapy found in

Belumosudil
Calcineurin inhibitors
Etanercept

Chronic GVHD

Key points

Key points


Before starting treatment, a diagnosis of
chronic GVHD will be confirmed and a
disease grade will be given.



When possible, a biopsy will be done to
confirm GVHD.



Grading is a rating or score given to any
signs of symptoms of GVHD.



Treatment for chronic GVHD aims to
control symptoms, avoid organ damage,
and improve quality of life.



In steroid-refractory chronic GVHD (SRcGVHD), GVHD stops responding to
or worsens on steroid treatment. More
systemic therapy will be added to your
treatment.



Participation in a clinical trial is
encouraged in anyone with cGVHD.

Making treatment decisions

It’s your choice

It’s important to be comfortable with
the cancer treatment you choose. This
choice starts with having an open and
honest conversation with your doctor.

your doctor, it will help you feel supported
when considering options and making
treatment decisions.

Second opinion

It’s your choice

It is normal to want to start treatment as soon
as possible. While cancer can’t be ignored,
there is time to have another doctor review
your test results and suggest a treatment plan.
This is called getting a second opinion, and it’s
a normal part of cancer care. Even doctors get
second opinions!

In shared decision-making, you and your
doctors share information, discuss the options,
and agree on a treatment plan. It starts with an
open and honest conversation between you
and your doctor.

Things you can do to prepare:

Treatment decisions are very personal. What
is important to you may not be important to
someone else.



Check with your insurance company
about its rules on second opinions. There
may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors
who are not part of your insurance plan.



Make plans to have copies of all your
records sent to the doctor you will see for
your second opinion.

Some things that may play a role in your
decision-making:


What you want and how that might differ
from what others want



Your religious and spiritual beliefs



Your feelings about certain treatments like
surgery or chemotherapy



Your feelings about pain or side effects
such as nausea and vomiting



Cost of treatment, travel to treatment
centers, and time away from school or
work



Quality of life and length of life



How active you are and the activities that
are important to you

Support groups

Many people diagnosed with cancer find
support groups to be helpful. Support groups
often include people at different stages
of treatment. Some people may be newly
diagnosed, while others may be finished with
treatment. If your hospital or community doesn’t
have support groups for people with cancer,
check out the websites listed in this book.

Questions to ask your doctors
Possible questions to ask your doctors are
listed on the following pages. Feel free to use
these questions or come up with your own. Be
clear about your goals for treatment and find
out what to expect from treatment.

Think about what you want from treatment.
Discuss openly the risks and benefits of
specific treatments and procedures. Weigh
options and share concerns with your doctor.
